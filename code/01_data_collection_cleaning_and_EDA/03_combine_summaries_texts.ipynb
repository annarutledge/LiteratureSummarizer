    "    'My Ántonia opens with a short frame story: the author (presumably Willa Cather) relates a chance meeting with an old acquaintance, Jim Burden, on a train ride through Iowa. The time appears to be roughly contemporary with the publication of the novel (1918).  The two adults reminisce about their shared Nebraska childhood, where they first met, and they mention a woman named Ántonia. They challenge each other to write an account of their relationship with Ántonia, and only Jim appears to follow through, composing a lengthy manuscript and bringing it to her a few months later.  The author says that this manuscript became the text of My Ántonia.',\n",
    "    'The book opens with Jim Burden, the narrator, being taken west from Virginia to Nebraska to live with his grandparents after his parents’ deaths. Jake Marpole, a farm hand who worked for Jim’s parents, accompanies him. Jake is a young man at the time, and Jim is ten years old. They take a train across the country, and they hear about an immigrant family traveling on the same train going to the same place, Black Hawk, Nebraska. Jake buys and gives Jim a copy of The Life of Jesse James, a book he treasures for many years. When they arrive at Black Hawk, Jake and Jim see the immigrant family (the Shimerdas), and hear the family talking in a foreign language. They are greeted by Otto Fuchs, a German immigrant and employee of Jim’s grandparents. Jim compares Fuchs to a character from the Jesse James book—he is visibly tanned and scarred, and dressed like a cowboy—and Fuchs leads them to a wagon to take them to the Burdens’ farm.  Jim notices the immigrant family again, getting into the only other wagon present. Fuchs drives them over the Nebraska land, and Jim thinks to himself about how empty and featureless the land is compared to Virginia.  He realizes he has left his parents behind, and he feels intimidated and insignificant under the vast sky and wide, flat land.',\n",
    "    'Jim falls asleep in the wagon and wakes up in his grandparents’ house. He sees his grandmother when he opens his eyes, and she immediately compares him to her dead son—Jim’s father—and invites him into the kitchen.  Jim makes his way out of bed and down to the basement kitchen, and he seems impressed by the order and cleanliness of the arrangement. He takes a bath in the tin washtub in the kitchen while his grandmother is in the attached dining room, refusing her help with cleaning himself.  Jim notices the details of the kitchen, acquaints himself with the pets of the house, and muses for a little while on his impressions of his grandparents. Otto Fuchs introduces him to one of the horses, and Jim, Otto, and Jake are called upstairs for prayers. The next day, Jim goes outside and starts to get to know the town. His grandparents apparently live in the only wooden house in the entire town; the neighbors live in sod houses Most of the area around the house, at least the part not covered with corn, is covered with wild red grass. As Jim is musing on the red grass, his grandmother invites him to accompany her to the garden to dig up some potatoes.\\xa0 She tells him that he should never go to the garden without some kind of weapon to protect him from rattlesnakes.\\xa0 After digging some potatoes, Jim asks if he can stay in the garden without his grandmother. She agrees, but she gives him some information about all of the various animals that he might see.  He spends a good portion of the day in the garden, and he enjoys the feeling that he has become part of the land.',\n",
    "    'A few days later, Jim accompanies Otto Fuchs on a trip to visit the new Bohemian family in the town with a gift of some provisions. Jim finds out that the Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, bought a piece of land not far from his grandparents, and that they had paid too much for it.\\xa0 They had been swindled by Peter Krajiek, a Bohemian man who was already living there. No one in the family spoke enough English to survive without Krajiek, so he also functioned as their interpreter. Fuchs suggests that he might have helped them with Krajiek, except that he doesn’t think the Shimerdas will trust an Austrian.  When asked to explain, Fuchs says that it’s “politics,” and that it would take too long, but that Bohemians don’t trust Austrians. As the Grandmother, Fuchs, and Jim make their way to the Shimerdas’ farm, they notice Squaw Creek, a narrow stream that runs through a deep ravine through the Shimerdas’ land. The ravine makes farming that piece of land difficult and reduces its value. They come upon the Shimerdas’ house, a dugout built against the edge of the ravine. Mrs. Shimerda comes out of the house to meet them, and shakes Grandmother’s hand. She speaks a little English about the house, saying that it is no good.  Ántonia and Yulka, the two daughters, come out of the house and meet the visitors, as does Ambrosch, the oldest son.  Ántonia, Jim notices, is brown-skinned and brown-eyed, and quite beautiful.  She is about fourteen years old, a few years older than Jim. While the two families are talking, Krajiek and Marek, the second son who shows off a webbed finger and acts a bit strangely, approach from the barn. At some point, Mr. Shimerda emerges, and Jim is greatly impressed by his appearance and his demeanor. Mr. Shimerda doesn’t seem to belong on a farm; he seems too aristocratic for farm labor. Ántonia and Yulka drag Jim away from his family and bring him over to the edge of the ravine  Ántonia starts quizzing him on the English names for things, including his own.  Jim teaches her several English words, and she tries to repay him with a gift of a ring. After a little while, Mr. Shimerda comes looking for the girls, and they run to meet him.  Mr. Shimerda confronts Jim with a silent, questioning look. Then he returns to the house, takes out a book with Bohemian and English alphabets, and asks Grandmother to teach Ántonia English.',\n",
    "    'Jim learns to ride one of his grandparents’ horses, and he becomes the messenger for the family. As the messenger, with the freedom of travel that he has with the horse, he becomes a sightseer, traveling about the area to admire the landscapes. He also instructs Ántonia in English every day. She runs across the prairie between them, and Jim shares some of the watermelon from the farm with her. Jim also notices the ways that the rattlesnakes take advantage of the prairie dogs in the area, and compares Krajiek to a rattlesnake in a prairie dog town. The Shimerdas don’t know how to get rid of their only English-speaking Bohemian companion. '\n",

       "'George Eliot, Adam Bede. Edited with an Introduction by Stephen Gill. Penguin Books, London, 1980, rpt. 1985.\\nBook First\\n\\xa0\\nSummary of Chapter 1: The Workshop\\nThe narrator will magically use the ink of her pen as a mirror to show us the carpentry workshop of Jonathan Burge in the village of Hayslope in Loamshire, England, 1799. Five workmen there are busy, the most striking of them a tall strong man singing a hymn in a baritone voice as he finishes a mantelpiece. This is Adam Bede, the obvious leader of the group. His brother, Seth, is younger and claims he has finished the door he is working on. Sandy Jim teases him that he forgot the panels on the door. Wiry Ben Cranage pipes in saying that after all, Seth is a wool-gathering Methodist. Adam pushes Ben against the wall until he promises to leave his brother alone. In friendly laughter, the men accuse Seth of thinking of the woman Methodist preacher who will preach on the Green tonight. Seth is in love with Dinah Morris and invites the others to hear her. Adam declares his loyalty to the Church but believes everyone should worship as he chooses. When the church clock strikes six, the other men immediately leave off working, but Adam chides them for having no pride in their work, and he continues until he finishes, going home with his dog, Gyp, while Seth goes to the Green to hear Dinah preach. A stranger, passing by on horseback, cannot help but admire Adam Bede as he passes.\\nCommentary on Chapter 1\\nThe chapter introduces the place and plunges us into a rural community in Loamshire, perhaps a fictitious name for Warwickshire where the author, Mary Ann Evans grew up and knew farm and village folk. Her father managed an estate there, and his early life provided material for the character of Adam Bede. This is country life in old England before the industrial revolution changed everything, and people moved to the cities for jobs. The author investigates the rural people, their habits and thinking, in greater detail than the English novel had done, for it usually dealt with the upper and middle classes. In this, Eliot is indebted to the poet, William Wordsworth, whose poetry is mentioned in the text. A quote from Wordsworth’s “The Excursion” also appears on the title page. The trials of simple country folk were significant to Wordsworth in what they could teach about life, since they were closer to the earth and primal feelings.\\nAdam Bede’s name indicates a primal man, like Adam in the Garden of Eden before the fall. Bede is the name of the Anglo-Saxon saint and historian of seventh and eighteenth century England and again brings up the suggestion of early English life in its simplicity. Adam is a peasant attached to the earth and is contrasted to the more spoiled gentry, like Arthur Donnithorne. Eliot uses dialect for the lower class characters, who speak for themselves, and then the narrator comments on their ways and their history, like a latter day Bede.\\nAdam’s protectiveness towards his younger brother Seth, his fondness for his dog, his love of his work, his love of learning, and his integrity all surface in the very first chapter. The other men respect him, even when he is a little stern with them. The discussion of religion is a main theme in the book and begins here with introducing the “dissenters” or groups that disagreed with the established English church, like the Methodists. Methodism began as a reform movement within the Church of England, begun by John and Charles Wesley, in 1729. Soon, it separated and became a religious movement of its own. The Methodists ministered to the poor, especially in the growing populations around industrial mill towns. These poor were more desperate than the poor in farm country. Methodists made converts easily near the mills and gave people hope, support, and unity. Seth is a Methodist, but Adam does not see why people should not stick to the Church. However, he has been influenced by his own pastor, Mr. Irwine, a tolerant man believing one should worship according to conscience. Adam also defends practical knowledge as important to learn as religion, and that is why he goes to night school to better himself.\\nThe theme of the book is found in the hymn Adam keeps singing: “Let all thy converse be sincere,/ Thy conscience as the noonday clear.”\\xa0 Adam is known for his honest dealings with others, a standard that not everyone can maintain, he finds out. Because he is so strong, both physically and morally, he cannot understand the weakness of others.'"

Five workmen there are busy, the most striking of them a tall strong man singing a hymn in a baritone voice as he finishes a mantelpiece. This is Adam Bede, the obvious leader of the group. His brother, Seth, is younger and claims he has finished the door he is working on. Sandy Jim teases him that he forgot the panels on the door. Wiry Ben Cranage pipes in saying that after all, Seth is a wool-gathering Methodist. Adam pushes Ben against the wall until he promises to leave his brother alone. In friendly laughter, the men accuse Seth of thinking of the woman Methodist preacher who will preach on the Green tonight. Seth is in love with Dinah Morris and invites the others to hear her. Adam declares his loyalty to the Church but believes everyone should worship as he chooses. When the church clock strikes six, the other men immediately leave off working, but Adam chides them for having no pride in their work, and he continues until he finishes, going home with his dog, Gyp, while Seth goes to the Green to hear Dinah preach. A stranger, passing by on horseback, cannot help but admire Adam Bede as he passes.\\n'"

On the first prediction, he comments that the story he will tell will reveal its truth or otherwise, and on the second prediction, he comments that he is not aware of having any such gift.\\n\\tDavid\\'s father is already dead when he is born. An aunt of his father\\'s, Miss Betsey Trotwood, turns up on the day of his birth. Betsey was once married to a man who beat her and tried to kill her, and she ended up paying him to stay away from her. Though Betsey was fond of David\\'s father, she was contemptuous of his mother, Clara Copperfield, calling her \"a wax doll.?/p>\\n\\tThis is the first time that Betsey has met Clara, and she gives her the nickname of Baby because of her youthful appearance. Betsey informs Clara that she is certain that she will give birth to a girl. She intends to be a friend to the girl, and to ensure that she does not place her trust in the type of man who will take advantage of her, as she herself did.\\n\\tLater, Mr. Chillip, the doctor, emerges from the birthing room with the news that Clara has had a boy. Without a word, Betsey walks out of the house, never to return.',\n",

One evening, David is reading to Peggotty from a book about crocodiles. He asks Peggotty if a person whose spouse dies can marry again. Peggotty says that they can if they choose, though she sounds unenthusiastic.\\n\\tClara comes in with Mr. Murdstone, a handsome man with black hair, eyes and whiskers, who is courting her. David takes an instant dislike to him. David falls asleep. When he wakes, he hears that both women are in tears. Peggotty is telling Clara that her former husband, David\\'s father, would not have liked Mr. Murdstone.\\n\\tMr. Murdstone returns one day and takes David on a trip to Lowestoft, a nearby town, to meet some of his business acquaintances. One of the men, Mr. Quinion, jokes with Mr. Murdstone about his courtship of Clara and David\\'s dislike of him. David observes that the men seem to share his wariness of Mr. Murdstone, and that Mr. Murdstone never laughs with them.\\n\\tOne evening, Peggotty asks David to accompany her on a two-week visit to her brother\\'s at Yarmouth. He excitedly agrees. As he says goodbye to his mother, Mr. Murdstone appears at her side and tells her to control her emotions.',\n",

Ham takes them to his family\\'s home, which is a boat converted into a house. Inside there is a smell of fish. Peggotty\\'s brother, Daniel Peggotty, who owns the house, deals in seafood, which he stores in an outhouse. Mr. Peggotty lives in the house with his nephew, Ham, and his niece, Little Em\\'ly, whom he adopted when their fathers drowned at sea. Also living with Mr. Peggotty is Mrs. Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty\\'s partner in a boat. Mr. Peggotty is an easy-going man who only becomes angry if his generosity in adopting destitute people is mentioned.\\n\\tNext morning, David goes out onto the beach with Little Em\\'ly, where they collect pebbles and fall in love with each other. Little Em\\'ly says that she is afraid of the sea, which has destroyed so many local men and boats. She also reveals that she wants to be a lady. The adult David reflects that perhaps it would have been better if the sea had swallowed Little Em\\'ly that morning, so that she would not have to suffer everything that she suffered since.\\n\\tMrs. Gummidge turns out to be a depressed sort of woman, given to complaining that \"I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me.?She claims that while others may share the adverse conditions that cause her grief, \"I feel it more.\" Mr. Peggotty remarks that \"She\\'s been thinking of the old \\'un,\" meaning her dead husband.\\n\\tAt the end of their vacation, Peggotty and David set out for home. David is excited to see his mother again, but Peggotty tries to restrain his enthusiasm. When they reach home, David is baffled that his mother has not come out to the gate to meet him. He fears that she is dead. Peggotty reveals that Clara has married Mr. Murdstone.\\n\\tDavid finds his mother sitting with Mr. Murdstone by the fire. Clara rises to meet David, but Mr. Murdstone tells her again to control her emotions. David finds that his bedroom has been moved to a more distant room.

       "'\\n\\nSummary\\nThe Jungle begins with Marija Berczynskas overseeing and organizing a wedding ceremony in the ‘back of the yards’ in Chicago. She is Lithuanian and today her cousin, Ona Lukoszaite, has just married fellow Lithuanian Jurgis Rudkus. Ona is not quite sixteen and the readers are told her new husband is able to carry a two hundred and fifty pound quarter of beef without staggering, but he is as ‘frightened as a hunted animal’ at the wedding celebrations.\\n\\tA ‘charming informality’ is one of the characteristics of this celebration, but it is a law (transplanted from Lithuania) that no one leaves hungry. Ona’s stepmother is Aunt Elizabeth, and is referred to as Teta Elzbieta, and she and other women bring masses of food through to the guests.\\n\\tThere is also music being played and this transforms the place from a saloon ‘to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky’. The violinist is Tamoszius Kuszleika and he later gets engaged to Marija. Ona is spared from crying too much (with happiness) by listening to Marija teach the musicians a song they do not know. She is described as a powerful woman who works in a canning factory handling fourteen-pound cans of beef.\\n\\tFollowing this, Antanas (Jurgis’s father) gives a speech. He is sixty years old, but looks eighty. He and the rest of the family have only been in the United States for six months, but this is already affecting him adversely. He works in the pickle rooms at Durham’s and this is damaging his chest.\\n\\tThe music begins again and the guests dance along. The older ones wear some item of clothing that is from their homeland, but the younger people avoid doing this. These younger people have assimilated more than their elders. Some of the dancers are described, such as Alena Jasaityte. She is the ‘beauty of the evening’ and paints cans all week in a factory.\\n\\tThe next event is one of the most important of the evening. This is the acziavimas, which is a three or four hour uninterrupted dance and each guest dances and leaves money for the bride and groom. The wedding costs two even three hundred dollars and this is more than a man’s wages for a year. The vesilija is a form of compact where the guests eat and drink as much as they desire, but also give the married couple money. This tradition is changing in the ‘new country’, though, and some are leaving without donating anything. Jurgis says not to worry as he will work harder to pay the bills for the wedding.\\n\\tChapter Two begins by explaining how Jurgis is still young and optimistic, and talks lightly about work. He is also naïve and has never lived in a city before. He met Ona and her family in Lithuania and her father initially refused him permission to marry her. Jurgis went back to see her a year later to ask again only to find her father had died and the family were now impoverished. This family now consisted of Ona, Teta Elzbieta, her six children and Ona’s brother Jonas. They all believed that coming to the United States would give them freedom and more opportunities. Before they set off, and at the last moment, Marija also decides to join them.\\n\\tWhen they arrive in the Packingtown district in Chicago, the smell of the stockyards greets them first. They are almost penniless once they reach here after being taken advantage of in New York (as they are clearly immigrants and know no English). They all stay at Aniele Jukniene’s home as she takes in lodgers. This is already overcrowded and ‘unthinkably filthy’. There are lots of children in the area, but no school and there is a fetid odor because this part of town is built on the city dump. Despite these conditions, Ona and Jurgis look out at Packingtown in awe.\\n\\tIn Chapter Three, Jokubas, a fellow Lithuanian who runs a delicatessen, shows them around the area. The cattle pens alone take up half of a square mile. He takes them to Durham’s and shows them a room where hogs are killed and the sound of their pitiful shrieks is given in detail. Their deaths are also depicted; a chain is attached to one of their legs and they are swung on this chain before being killed. The factory is described as such: ‘It was porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics.’ The narrative continues to describe the unpleasant conditions and how the inspectors are lax in checking the hogs for tuberculosis.\\n\\tDescriptions then ensue of the killing of cattle and of how nothing of the animals is wasted at Durham’s. They are thought to furnish food for thirty million people. At this early time in the narrative, Jurgis thinks the workers should be grateful to have positions with such a company and is described as guileless.\\n\\tHis first work is with Durham’s rivals, Brown’s. The bosses quickly choose him when he first waits for work, because he is young and has a large stature. Because of his naivety, he is unable to see that he is lucky to have been picked.\\nAnalysis\\n\\tChapter One begins with the marriage of Ona and Jurgis and from Chapter Two to Chapter Seven the narrative takes the readers back to explain how the families arrived and settled in the United States, and how they saved for the wedding to take place.\\n\\tChapter One is primarily concerned with describing how Ona and Jurgis are marrying in a traditionally Lithuanian way, and how these customs are being eroded for the worse in this new country. In the United States, the guests are less willing to pay after eating and drinking as much as possible. By beginning in such a way, the novel emphasizes immediately how the United States is having a detrimental effect on earlier traditions and how the cracks in the family’s American Dream are beginning to appear after being in this country for only a few months.\\n\\tChapters Two and Three trace back to six months ago to when Jurgis and his father and Ona and her family came to the United States with hopes for a better future. The narrative is careful to reiterate how they innocently presumed that life would improve. This is most evident in the depiction of the central character, Jurgis, who at this early time still believes that he will be treated fairly. He is depicted as honest and willing to work, and it is also evident that he is naïve in the practices of the packers (the firms who kill the animals and produce the meat and by-products). He is in awe of companies such as Durham’s and Brown’s and is unable to see that he has only been chosen to work because of his age and build and neither of these advantages will last long with the hard work he has to undertake.\\n'"

       "'Prelude\\nSummary\\n\\tThis is a charming vignette of Saint Theresa of Avila as a little girl, holding her brother by the hand, going out into the country side looking for martyrdom, illustrating the “passionate, ideal nature [that demands] an epic life.” Such a girl who has a “rapturous consciousness of life beyond self” could hardly be content with a normal woman’s life. She is the type of many such women today who yearn for an expanded life but are not helped by the “tangled circumstance” of society. This tragic sort of woman in the modern world has no channel for her life force, but only a “vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood.” She is a swan among ducks and finds no fellowship.\\n\\tAnalysis\\n\\tEliot’s famous Prelude to Middlemarch could be the outcry of the Victorian woman, or women of any age, who have no outlet for their talents or direction for their spiritual lives. They are like the child Theresa, who nevertheless, even in a man’s world, grew up to reform a religious order. Eliot sets up an epic question: what sort of heroism is possible in the modern world, especially for women? Her main character, Dorothea Brooke, is such a modern St. Theresa.\\nChapters 1-5 (The Brooke Sisters)\\nSummary\\n\\tDorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Celia, are two young ladies of marriageable age who have recently come to live with their bachelor uncle and guardian, Mr. Brooke, at Tipton Grange. Though Dorothea is the striking and beautiful older sister, the rural opinion favors the pretty Celia as the one who is easier to understand. While Celia knows life through common sense, Dorothea is always out of place with her refined religious perceptions and longings. Dorothea is severe and Puritanical compared to Celia, who has normal coquettish desires for dress, jewelry, and conquests.\\n\\tDorothea does not want a husband like the neighbor, Sir James Chettham, an amiable but ordinary squire, who is in love with her. She thinks him boring, though in her passion for good works, she persuades him to build decent cottages for his tenants and gives him her designs. He goes along with her plans as he prepares to propose to her. No one reckons on Dorothea’s lofty thoughts of an ideal husband, who would be her superior in learning, and spiritually elevated. Into the picture steps Reverend Casaubon, a clergyman of fifty. Dorothea, not yet eighteen, immediately romanticizes him as a type of Milton or Locke. She wants to devote herself to someone who can teach her wisdom. Mr. Brooke tries to dissuade her from getting engaged to Casaubon, but she accepts him, to everyone’s shock.\\nAnalysis\\n\\tOne of the main characters of the novel is the narrator who tells the story from the multiple points of view of the characters, while adding her own reflective wisdom. This vantage point gives us compassionate insight into each character but within a certain social context, for the narrator stands for the collective wisdom gleaned from all the lives put together. This narrator is “omniscient” and anonymous, though we can think of her as close to George Eliot’s own viewpoint.\\n\\tImmediately, the narrator begins to uncover the fact that most people are lost in their own illusions of reality, one of the themes of the book. She brilliantly weaves together the intersecting illusions of all the characters, showing us the profile of the town of Middlemarch, a fictitious small town in the rural English midlands in the early nineteenth century. Middlemarch stands for English life just before the impact of the industrial revolution. The time is just before the great Reform Bill of 1832. Life is still somewhat simple and conventional here in this backwater, and the citizens are not interested in anything but daily concerns. This sets the stage for their clashes with the more extraordinary and farsighted characters, Dorothea and Lydgate and Will Ladislaw who stand for the forces of change.\\n\\tWhile it could be rather farcical that the beautiful Dorothea, who is constantly compared to the Blessed Virgin, is marrying Casaubon, the “dried bookworm of fifty,” Eliot treats Dorothea’s “soul hunger” as a real and tragic phenomenon in this society. She has no teacher or even comrade to whom she may tell of her own exalted thoughts and wishes. Even her sister Celia, though adoring her, criticizes her, and does not understand her need for living her religious vision in daily life. Dorothea thinks that Casaubon will understand and teach her, while he, it is clear, expects an obedient and self-abnegating wife. The narrator gives us foreshadowing of this problematic marriage by explaining Dorothea’s short-sightedness and “theoretic” nature, desire for “intensity and greatness.” Casaubon also has trouble with his vision and needs a secretary to help him with his life work, The Key to All Mythologies.\\n'"

       "'Summary\\n\\tImogen is lamenting her unhappy situation, and wishes she had been stolen like her brothers. Pisanio enters with Iachimo, introducing him as a gentleman from Rome who has brought letters from Posthumus, who is safe. In an aside, Iachimo praises Imogen\\'s beauty and admits that if her mind is as admirable, he has lost his wager.\\n\\tPosthumus, in his letter, asks Imogen to treat Iachimo well in return for his \"kindnesses\" to Posthumus (line 23). She welcomes him. Iachimo appears to be wonder-struck by Imogen\\'s beauty, and muses aloud how anyone could fail to distinguish between fair and foul. He seems to imply, without actually saying it outright, that there is another woman whom, in spite of her obvious inferiority (\"sluttery,\" line 44), Posthumus is driven by lust to prefer to Imogen.\\n\\tImogen is mystified but changes the subject, asking after Posthumus\\'s health and state of mind. Iachimo takes his chance to blacken Posthumus\\'s character further, saying he is so merry that he is called \"the Briton reveller\". Imogen says he is more usually inclined to sadness; Iachimo replies that he has never seen Posthumus sad. On the contrary, he says, he laughs at a Frenchman who is pining after his girlfriend at home, for wasting time in such \"bondage.\" He suggests that Posthumus is abusing his God-given bounty (both his own talents and his wife), and says he pities them. Posthumus neglects his \"sun\" (Imogen) and takes solace in a dungeon by the light of a burned-out candle, a a reference, perhaps, to a sordid and secretive place or to the worn-out slut whom he alleges Posthumus meets there.\\n\\tImogen asks Iachimo to speak more openly, as she would rather know the truth. Iachimo protests that if he had a woman such as Imogen, he would never pursue common prostitutes. Imogen is worried, saying that her husband \"has forgot Britain\" (line 113). Iachimo says Posthumus is forcing her to live a nun-like life while he is living a sexually promiscuous life on her money. He urges her to revenge and dedicates himself to her \"sweet pleasure\" (line 136), saying that unlike Posthumus, he will be loyal to her.\\n\\tHe tries to kiss Imogen, but this action prompts her to see Iachimo for what he is. She calls for Pisanio, and rejects Iachimo\\'s advance, reproaching herself for listening to him. His motivation, she says, was not virtuous but self-seeking, to obtain her for himself. She says he has wronged Posthumus and that she will tell her father of his assault.\\n\\tIachimo rapidly changes direction, protesting that his aim was only to test her loyalty to Posthumus, and that he did so out of love to him. He begs her to forgive him, which she does.\\n\\tIachimo then asks Imogen to store a trunk containing expensive plate and jewels which he, Posthumus and some other friends have jointly bought as a gift for the Roman Emperor. She agrees, and as Posthumus has an interest in them, says she will keep them in her bedroom. Iachimo says he will have them sent to her just for tonight, as he must leave tomorrow. She tries to persuade Iachimo to stay, but he cannot. He suggests that she write Posthumus a letter tonight so that he can return with it tomorrow.\\n\\tAnalysis\\n\\tIachimo\\'s base nature is displayed in his use of animal imagery (lines 39-50). Apes, he says, would discriminate better than Posthumus does between Imogen and the imaginary \"slut.\" He likens Posthumus to a predator which devours first the lamb (Imogen) but, still hungry, wants to feed on \"garbage.\"\\n\\tIachimo\\'s description of Posthumus in exile as \"the Briton reveler\" is calculated to upset Imogen and make her suspicious of her husband\\'s loyalty. He uses images of rot, decay, disease and poison to excite disgust at Posthumus\\'s supposed life of whoring: \"Such boil\\'d stuff / As well might poison poison!\" (line 126) is thought to refer to the sweating treatment given to people suffering from venereal disease. Note that he also tries to set Imogen against Posthumus by accusing Posthumus of going whoring on her money, a continuation the theme of buying and selling.\\n\\tIachimo\\'s dedication of himself to Imogen\\'s \"sweet pleasure\" may be taken to mean he will do what she wishes by way of helping her take revenge, or may be a seduction attempt. Probably, it carries both meanings. His mind constantly runs along animalistic and sexual tracks, debasing the love relationship between Posthumus and Imogen.\\n\\tThe rapidity with which Iachimo changes track once Imogen sees through him, and appeals to her naturally open nature, indicates his great skill in manipulating people. Imogen\\'s willingness to forgive Iachimo contrasts markedly with her father\\'s failure to forgive her for marrying against his wishes.\\n'"
