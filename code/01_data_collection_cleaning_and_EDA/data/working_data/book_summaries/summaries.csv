0,Ivanhoe: Summary,"Chapter I
	The story is set in England in the twelfth century, towards the end of the reign of Richard I. Richard is absent from the country. He has been imprisoned in Austria on his return from the Crusades in the Holy Land. In his absence, the nobles have established a tyranny, and the lower classes suffer under it. This situation arose as a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Although four generations have passed since then, there is still hostility between the Normans, who were originally from France, and the conquered population of Anglo-Saxons.
	It is an early evening in summer in a forest in the area of northern England known as the West Riding of Yorkshire. Gurth, the swine-herd, is talking to Wamba, the jester. Both are in the employ of Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon noble. Gurth appeals to Wamba to help him round up the herd, but Wamba is reluctant. Wamba then makes a series of pointed jokes at the expense of the Normans, whom they both dislike. Gurth then complains that the Normans take the best of everything, although Cedric has been valiant in the preservation of Saxon rights. But he fears the imminent visit of a Norman noble, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
	Chapter II
	A group of ten horsemen overtake Wamba and Gurth on the road. The two most important men in this group are an easy-going, generous-minded monk, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and a stern knight of the order of the Knights Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who has been fighting in the Holy Land. The other men are their attendants. The prior and the knight ask Gurth and Wamba the way to Cedric the Saxon’s home, where they desire to stay the night. Gurth is reluctant to give these Normans directions to his master’s dwelling, and he quarrels with the knight. The prior intervenes to keep the peace. Then Wamba gives the men the wrong directions. But when the men reach the place called Sunken Cross, where Wamba told them to turn left, they cannot remember what the directions were. They stop a stranger, who says he is also going to Cedric’s. The stranger, who says he is a palmer (pilgrim) just returned from the Holy Land, then leads them in the right direction until they arrive at Cedric’s mansion.
	Chapter III
	In Cedric’s mansion, the hall is prepared for the evening meal. Cedric sits at his table on a raised dais, waiting for the dinner, which has been delayed, to be served. Several servants stand behind him, and his dogs are at his feet. Cedric is anxious because Gurth has not returned with the herd, and he fears that some misfortune has befallen them, although he is more worried about the herd (which is valuable) than about Gurth. He is also impatient for his favorite clown, Wamba. When Oswald, his cup-bearer, says that Gurth is not that late, since the curfew bell only tolled an hour ago, Cedric is put in an even worse temper. This is because the curfew is a Norman imposition. Cedric rants about all the injustices that accompany Norman rule, and he also mentions his son that he banished. Then the sound of the Knight Templar’s horn outside interrupts him. Cedric is none too pleased to hear who the visitors are, because both are Normans, but he wishes to show hospitality nonetheless. The guests are shown in.
	Chapter IV
	Cedric greets his hosts with dignity, although there is some tension between the Saxon Cedric and his Norman guests. Wamba and Gurth return, to Cedric’s complaints about how tardy they are. The feast is a fine one, and the diners are joined by Cedric’s beautiful young ward, the Lady Rowena. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar, is captivated by her and stares at her, which displeases both Rowena and Cedric. In the discussion over dinner, it transpires that the Knight and Prior are on their way to a tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Another stranger arrives at the gate, and Cedric authorizes his page to allow him to stay the night.
The opening chapters introduce a number of the themes of the novel and show the situations of many of the main characters. Chapter I makes is clear how divided the country is between Normans and Saxons, and how the Norman nobles have established a tyranny. In this theme the author, Sir Walter Scott, is not being true to history. Scholars of the period agree that any hostility between Norman and Saxon did not last for four generations after the Norman Conquest. In those days, people were more conscious of divisions of rank than of national origin. Scott’s picture of Saxons and Normans in fact represents more the typical nineteenth century view of the good-hearted, rough-and-ready English and the foppish, pretentious French. Hostility between England and France was a habit acquired over several centuries of frequent wars between the two countries. (The war in which the English defeated Napoleon was fresh in the minds of the first readers of Ivanhoe, which was published only a few years after Napoleon’s final defeat.)
	The lines of conflict that are to dominate the novel are clearly drawn in the opening chapters. Cedric’s disinheritance of his son is mentioned, and this father-son drama will become an important element in the plot. Lady Rowena is introduced, and as a beautiful young unmarried woman she is clearly going to be the subject of a romantic plot, although De Bois-Guilbert’s early interest in her does prove to be something of a red herring.
	The Norman villain of the novel is also introduced in these early chapters. De Bois-Guilbert is presented as an arrogant, quarrelsome knight, as his treatment of Gurth in Chapter II shows. His susceptibility to women, later to become one of the main plot elements, is also shown. It runs counter to the vow of chastity he took as a member of the Knight Templar Order.
	Just as the representatives of medieval chivalry do not emerge as admirable characters, neither do the representatives of the medieval church. One such representative is introduced in these chapters. The initial description of the Prior tells its own tale. His clothes are much finer than the rules of his Cistercian order permit—a sign of his hypocrisy. The fact that he is overweight, not to mention the twinkle in his eye, indicates that he enjoys the pleasures of eating and drinking.

1,Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"In 399 B.C., Athens sought someone to blame for its humiliating defeat in the Peloponnesian War with Sparta and its allies. This scapegoat, through default more than anything, became Socrates, the legendary Athenian philosopher. Since Socrates often questioned the intentions of Athens' politicians, he was blamed for attempting to ruin Athens through slander of its leaders and religious tradition.
	Socrates defends his actions in The Apology, and defends his decision to carry out his conviction in Crito. When the court suggests to Socrates that he will be acquitted if he agrees to stop practicing philosophy, he responds by saying, ""Athenians, I hold you in the highest regard and love; but I will obey God rather than you: and as long as I have breath and strength I will not cease from philosophy, and from exhorting you, and declaring the truth to every one of you whom I meet.Either acquit me, or do not acquit me, but be sure that I shall not alter my way of life; no, not if I have to die for it many times.""
	Crito takes place later, after Socrates is condemned to death and sitting in jail. At this time, Socrates has many followers who hope he will agree to escape. When Crito, a friend of the philosopher, comes to advocate this position, Socrates logically refutes his argument.",Crito
2,NovelGuide: Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Crito enters the cell, depressed himself at the prospect of Socrates' unjust death. Socrates asserts that a man of his age is lucky to have lived so long, and that his mandated death has not cut short his life. Next, Crito grudgingly tells Socrates that the ship from Delos is approaching, marking the end of an annual Athenian celebration that prohibits political executions for the several weeks of its duration.
	Socrates seems resigned to his fated death, but Crito attempts to persuade him to allow his friends to help him escape prison and flee Athens. If this doesn't happen, Crito says, others will criticize Socrates' disciples for not rescuing their leader from this unfair sentence. Yet Socrates asserts that following popular opinion instead of the gods' will is not right. Soon Crito becomes more desperate, hoping to encourage Socrates with his elaborate and carefully designed plan for escape. He further suggests to Socrates that unless he agrees to escape, he will be letting his sons, who still need to be properly educated by their father, down.
	Socrates responds by inviting Crito into a classic Socratic dialogue, in which Socrates asks a series of questions in efforts to eventually prove Crito's logic faulty. He begins by convincing Crito that the advice of one ""expert"" individual, namely God, should be heeded much more than the advice of countless ignorant people, namely Athens' as a whole. In this way, he proves to Crito that popular opinion is irrelevant.
	Next, Socrates makes the point that it is always better to do right than wrong, no matter what the circumstances. It then follows that although the jurors who condemned Socrates have wronged him, it would still be wrong to violate the laws by escaping. Socrates continues by stating that he doesn't believe in doing wrong to others as a means of retaliation. Crito, helpless in Socrates' logic, quickly agrees with all of this.
",Crito
3,NovelGuide: Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"In this part of the dialogue, Socrates gets to the core of his argument. He asserts that when he agreed to citizenship, he agreed to an unofficial contract with the city of Athens. Socrates says that Athens has married his parents, raised him, and educated him and his children. In return, Socrates has agreed to abide by the city's laws and constitution. In this way, Socrates believes that if he were to escape death, as Crito recommends, he would be breaking the sacred covenant he holds with Athens. The philosopher believes that since he was unable to persuade the jurors in his trial, he now must accept their sentence. Violence, he says, will undermine the very laws that gave him life.
	Speaking in the voice of the law, Socrates supports his premise, saying, ""And we maintain that anyone who disobeys is guilty of doing wrong on three separate counts: first because we are his parent. And secondly because we are his guardians, and thirdly because, after promising obedience, he is neither obeying us nor persuading us to change our decision if we are at fault in any way.""
	Socrates asserts, ""integrity, institutions and laws, are the most precious possessions of mankind."" His last point concerns the jury's decision to condemn him. Socrates believes that though his fellow citizens, the jurors, came to the wrong decision in his trial, it is not his place to avenge their flawed logic. Though people make mistakes, Socrates thinks, the system works. In this way, Socrates dies as a martyr, not for himself, but for his city and its system of justice.

5,Henry VIII: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"
	 
Summary
	The play opens in a room at the court of King Henry VIII, in London. The Duke of Norfolk meets the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Abergavenny. Buckingham asks Norfolk how he has been since they last met in France. Norfolk replies that he is well, and still admires what he saw there. They had accompanied the king to a great display of wealth and military prowess by England and France, which took place in a field in France. Norfolk describes the impressive scene to Buckingham, who had missed everything through illness.
	Buckingham asks who organized the event, and Norfolk says it was Cardinal Wolsey, the king's chief advisor. Buckingham voices his contempt and dislike for Wolsey as an ambitious, meddling self-seeker, and condemns the event in France as ""vanities."" Norfolk is more conciliatory, pointing out that Wolsey lacks the example lent by noble ancestors and experienced assistants; he is a self-made man and has only his own resources to rely on.
	Abergavenny joins in with Buckingham's condemnation of Wolsey, criticising his pride, which he says is ""from hell."" Buckingham adds that Wolsey did not seek the king's permission when deciding who should go to France. Wolsey made the nobles pay for the event, yet he gave least honor to those who paid most. Abergavenny confirms that several of his relatives funded the event by selling part of their estates, which would never recover. Buckingham says the event resulted only in a massive waste of money and empty talk. Norfolk agrees that the peace between England and France does not justify such a cost. In any case, France has broken the agreement by seizing British merchants' goods at Bordeaux. But he warns Buckingham to be careful, since Wolsey is a powerful and vengeful man.
	They are interrupted by the arrival of Wolsey with his guards and secretaries. Wolsey and Buckingham glare at each other. Wolsey asks a secretary if Buckingham's former Surveyor (estate overseer), who has come to give evidence against him, has arrived. The secretary says he has, and Wolsey leaves with his party.
	Buckingham fears that Wolsey is plotting against him. He thinks he is on his way to the king to stir up trouble for him, and decides to follow him. But Norfolk warns Buckingham against this, advising him to calm down and show restraint. Buckingham takes his advice, though he says he has proof that Wolsey is corrupt and treasonous. Norfolk is shocked by the accusation of treason, but Buckingham insists that he will say as much to the king, and provide proof. Buckingham enumerates Wolsey's faults: he is greedy, cunning, and given to mischief; he organized the French event simply to show off his high status in France as well as England; and he drew up the France-England treaty that was agreed there to suit his own ends. He also deals with Queen Katherine's nephew, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, behind King Henry's back. Charles had been worried at the prospect of England forming an alliance with France, as it would threaten Spain's interests. Wolsey, says Buckingham, buys and sells the king's honor for his own advantage.
	At that moment, Brandon, the sergeant-at-arms, comes in with the Guard, and arrests Buckingham in the name of the king, on the charge of high treason. Buckingham is certain that Wolsey has arranged this. He says goodbye to Abergavenny, but Brandon says he has come to arrest him too, along with others among their friends. Buckingham says that Wolsey must have bribed the Surveyor to incriminate him. As the prisoners are taken to be locked up in the Tower of London, Buckingham believes his life is over.
	Analysis
	The Prologue sets the scene for the play, making clear that its purpose is to present historical truth and arouse pity for those powerful people who have fallen. The play covers some years of the reign of King Henry VIII up to the birth of his daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth I, by his second wife, Anne Boleyn.
	The first scene establishes the character of Wolsey as seen from the point of view of his enemy, Buckingham. We do not yet know how objectively true Buckingham's opinion is. Certain aspects of his tirade against Wolsey betray the prejudice of the noble (Buckingham) for the self-made humbly born man (Wolsey). Wolsey was reported to be the son of a butcher, so Buckingham calls him a ""butcher's cur"" (line 120) and invokes the traditional distinction of rank to ""cry down"" ""This Ipswich fellow's insolence"" (lines 137-8). His attitude reflects the widespread alarm among the nobility in Tudor times at the rise of a wealthy merchant middle-class and a more flexible class and education system that allowed low-class men like Wolsey to attain high office.
	However, Buckingham's accusations of ruthlessness and cunning are backed up by Wolsey's hostile attitude to him during his brief appearance, along with the arrrest of Buckingham at the end of the scene. It is significant too that at his arrest, Buckingham is accused of exactly the same crime of which he had previously accused Wolsey. The impression given is that Wolsey has both spied upon and plotted against Buckingham. Also striking is the fact that Buckingham claims he has proof of Wolsey's treason, yet Wolsey has as yet presented no evidence of Buckingham's treason - but Wolsey is nevertheless able to have Buckingham arrested for treason. This shows that the power lies with Wolsey, not with the likes of Buckingham and those nobly born friends of his who are also arrested.
	The Prologue had warned that the play would show us ""How soon this mightiness meets misery,"" or the fall of powerful people. Buckingham is the first to fall, through the intervention of Wolsey.
	The display of military achievement by the royal courts of France and England referred to in this scene is known to historians as the Field of the Cloth of Gold, after the rich materials of the tents set up to accommodate the royals and nobles who attended. The event took place in 1520 against the background of a triangular power struggle in Europe between the great powers of the time - France (ruled by King Francis I), Spain (ruled by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, also the nephew of King Henry VIII's wife Katherine), and the newcomer, England. France and Spain vied with each other for an alliance with England to swing the balance of power in their favor. Wolsey favored an allliance with France, but Katherine favored an alliance with her home country of Spain. The Field of the Cloth of Gold, where King Henry VIII of England and King Francis I of France agreed in principle to an alliance, appeared to be a victory for Wolsey, but it was somewhat tainted and short-lived. The event severely strained the finances of both countries and the results were negligible. Shortly after, Henry met Charles V in England and signed a treaty with the Empire. Over the next few years, treaties between the three countries were signed and broken with wearisome regularity, with the result that no one power gained ascendancy.

Summary
	The king, leaning on Wolsey's shoulder, thanks him for foiling Buckingham's treasonous plot. He asks for Buckingham's Surveyor, who had testified against his master, to be brought before him so that he can hear his evidence.
	Queen Katherine enters, with the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and kneels before the king. The king greets her and bids her rise, but she insists on remaining on her knees, since she is going to make a request of him. She explains that she has been asked to intercede with the king by his subjects, who are upset at the levying of new taxes. The people especially blame Wolsey, who originated the taxes, but their anger is also directed at the king, who is ultimately responsible. She fears that rebellion will break out. Norfolk backs up her argument, saying that employers have had to lay off their employees in order to pay the taxes, creating a desperate class of unemployed and starving people.
	The king says he is unaware of the new tax. Katherine explains that each subject is being asked to pay one sixth of his worth to pay for the king's wars in France, and that this is turning formerly loyal subjects hostile. The king says he is unhappy about the tax. Wolsey protests that the tax was levied unanimously by the entire king's Council and approved by the judges; his was only ""a single voice"" in the decision. He says that we should not refrain from doing necessary actions out of fear of malicious critics. He adds that our best actions are often the most criticised, and our worst, the most praised. The king replies that things that are carefully thought out do not create fear in the people. Believing that the tax is far too harsh, he tells Wolsey to revoke it and send letters to each county issuing a free pardon for any man who has refused to pay. Wolsey passes this order on to his secretary, but tells him to start a rumor that it is at Wolsey's request that the king revoked the tax.
	Buckingham's former Surveyor comes in. Katherine tells the king that she regrets that he is displeased with Buckingham. The king praises Buckingham's noble qualities, but says that he has become corrupted. He asks the Surveyor to repeat his evidence so that Katherine can hear it. The Surveyor says that Buckingham told his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny, that if the king died without a male heir, he himself would claim the throne. A friar, Nicholas Henton, had encouraged Buckingham to believe that he could be king.
	Katherine points out that Buckingham had fired the Surveyor when his tenants complained about him. She warns that the Surveyor could be giving false evidence to gain revenge on his former master. But the king asks the Surveyor to continue. The Surveyor vows that he is telling the truth. He goes on to say that Buckingham had said that if the king died, he (Buckingham) would have Wolsey and Sir Thomas Lovell executed in order to clear his path to the throne. The Surveyor also claims that Buckingham had told a story about his father, who had planned to kill Richard III to prevent him from usurping the throne, but had been foiled when he could not gain admittance to Richard. Buckingham, the Surveyor says, had vowed to outdo his father and kill King Henry VIII. The king is convinced that Buckingham is a traitor and orders that he be brought to trial immediately.
	Analysis
	By far the wisest character in this scene (arguably, in the whole play) is Queen Katherine. She has the ability to look beyond the surface of things and see their root causes. She warns the king of imminent rebellion if he does not repeal Wolsey's new tax. She also warns the king of the unreliability of the Surveyor's evidence against Buckingham, on the grounds that he might be motivated by a grudge against his former master, who had fired him.
	The king, while motivated by integrity and generosity, lacks his wife's insight. Though he takes Katherine's advice regarding the tax and repeals it, by his inattention, he allows Wolsey, who originated the tax, to continue to operate in pursuit of his own ends. This confirms Buckingham's charge in the previous scene that Wolsey has taken on some of the king's authority. The king also shows poor judgement in failing to listen to Katherine when she warns that the Surveyor may not be an impartial witness. Naively, he is more ready to trust Wolsey in his view of Buckingham as a traitor.
	The Surveyor's reference to Richard III refers to Shakespeare's play of that name. The play tells how Buckingham's father, also called the Duke of Buckingham, supported Richard in his struggle to be crowned king. He helped Richard get rid of those family members who stood between him and the throne. Eventually, Buckingham Senior had begun to doubt Richard and refused to carry out his order to murder two young princes who preceded Richard in line to the throne. When Richard became king, Buckingham Senior asked for the reward of land that Richard had promised him. Richard, however, suspected that he could no longer rely on Buckingham Senior's loyalty, and had him executed. In Henry VIII, the Surveyor says that Buckingham Junior was planning to go further than his father, and to kill King Henry.

7,Henry VIII: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 3 & 4,"
	 
Summary
	The Lord Chamberlain and Lord Sands are making fun of the odd fashions that have been brought back to the English court by nobles who went to France. Sir Thomas Lovell enters with the news that a proclamation has been issued at the court urging people to abandon the French fashions. The three men agree that this is a good idea.
	Lovell says that he is going to Wolsey's house for a lavish supper, and that the Lord Chamberlain and Sands are also invited. They agree that Wolsey is generous, and set out for Wolsey's house, St James's Palace.
	At St James's Palace, Sir Henry Guilford greets the guests on behalf of Wolsey. Among the guests is Anne Bullen (Boleyn), who will become King Henry's second wife. Sands flirts with Anne.
	Wolsey enters and sits on the chair of state. A group of strangers is shown in by a Servant. Their faces are covered with masks and they are pretending to be foreign shepherds, seemingly from France. In reality, this is the king and some of his courtiers in disguise. The strangers greet Wolsey. The Lord Chamberlain explains to him that they speak no English, but that they have heard impressive tales of Wolsey's party and could not fail to attend. Wolsey welcomes them.
	The disguised king meets Anne and is struck by her beauty. He dances with Anne, and the rest of his party dance with other ladies. After the dance ends, Wolsey asks the Lord Chamberlain to tell the strangers that there is one among them who is more worthy of his chair of state than he is himself. If that person would make himself known, he would surrender it to him. The Lord Chamberlain conveys this suggestion to the strangers and they reply, saying that there is such a person, and that Wolsey must guess which is he. Wolsey correctly identifies the king, who takes off his mask.
	The king compliments Wolsey on the large number of beautiful women present, warning that if he were not a churchman (and therefore, in theory, above reproach), he would judge him unfavorably. The king asks Wolsey the identity of the beautiful woman he just met, and Wolsey replies that it was Anne Bullen, daughter of Sir Thomas Bullen and lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine. The king tells Anne that it was bad manners on his part to dance with her and not kiss her, which he does now. He is reluctant to part with her and orders the music to strike up for another dance.
	Analysis
	These scenes have two main functions, serving to show the almost royal status that Wolsey has built up for himself, and to introduce King Henry to his future wife and the future mother of Queen Elizabeth I, Anne Bullen.
	The two themes inter-relate because we later find out that Wolsey is scheming for Henry to marry the sister of the French king, in order to cement the alliance agreed at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Thus, Wolsey does not support the marriage between Henry and Anne. In terms of the grand purpose of this play, which is to celebrate the birth of Queen Elizabeth I, Wolsey is on the 'wrong' side and so is doomed to fall. This is reinforced by the lengthy gibe at outlandish French fashions at the beginning of scene 3. Queen Elizabeth I always boasted that (unlike her half-sister, Mary I, the daughter of the Spanish Queen Katherine) she was thoroughly English-bred. Here, Shakespeare has the nobles put forward an anti-French and nationalistic point of view. However, it cannot be assumed that this was Shakespeare's own view, since most of his plays show a truly cosmopolitan fascination with the fashions, culture, geography and mores of continental Europe. Even in this scene from Henry VIII, the nobles' mockery of French fashions is good-natured and displays a detailed interest in, and knowledge of, the subject.
	It is implicit in these scenes that Wolsey, a churchman, has over-reached himself in status and has become unfittingly worldly. Churchmen (especially after Henry VIII made himself head of the Church of England, independent of the Catholic Church and the Pope, in 1535) were expected to be humble, abstemious and plain-living people, known for their wisdom and holiness. Shakespeare's Wolsey, on the other hand, is known primarily for throwing lavish parties with rich food, drink, dancing and beautiful women. Like the king, Wolsey lives in a palace, and also like the king (in Act 1, scene 2), he sits on a throne of state. The fact that we have already seen the king sitting on his throne, and now we have seen Wolsey sitting in his, plants a suggestion in our minds that Wolsey aspires to royal status. In a low-born ""butcher's cur,"" people of Shakespeare's time would have seen such raw ambition as a violation of the laws of nature - kings were determined by ancient royal bloodlines and appointed by God himself - as well as potentially treasonous. Significantly, at his party, Wolsey is careful to surrender his own chair of state to the king, but there is a foreshadowing of danger in the possibility that Wolsey will not recognise the disguised king.
	Shakespeare introduces subtle pointers to the inherent wrongness of the spiritual leader of a nation becoming famous for his worldly qualities and trappings. In Act 1, scene 3, line 60, Sands, talking of Wolsey's great wealth, notes that if he were mean with his hospitality, this would be ""a worse sin than ill doctrine."" The sin of a man of the church would indeed be ""ill doctrine"" - incorrect theological beliefs - but Wolsey has crossed over into being a rich man of the world, in which case the only sin he could be guilty of is meanness. In scene 4, Sands' suggestive banter about the attractive women present would suit the worldly atmosphere of the court, but would be inappropriate in the house of a deeply spiritual churchman - which Wolsey clearly is not. Wolsey's invitation to his guests to ""take their pleasures"" would almost fit in the mouth of a brothel-keeper.
	The most overt condemnation of Wolsey's lifestyle is the king's barbed comment, ""You are a churchman, or I'll tell you cardinal, / I should judge now most unhappily."" The genial surface meaning of the king's comment is that Wolsey's status as a churchman means that he is above reproach, even while he holds a party stuffed with beautiful women. The more threatening underlying meaning, of which the king may or may not be aware, is that Wolsey is not a true man of the church and deserves to be judged unfavorably for betraying his sacred office.

Summary
	Two Gentlemen meet in the street. The Second Gentleman is on his way to see the trial of the Duke of Buckingham. The First Gentleman says that he is too late: it is over. Buckingham pleaded not guilty and spoke eloquently in his defense, but he was found guilty of treason. Those who testified against him included his Surveyor; Sir Gilbert Perk, his chancellor (secretary); John Car, his confessor; and the friar, Nicholas Hopkins (earlier in the play called Henton), who encouraged Buckingham to believe he should be king.
	The Second Gentleman says that Wolsey is responsible for all this. Wolsey has also been sending nobles favored by the king to distant parts. The Second Gentleman says that the people's representatives in Parliament (""the commons"") hate Wolsey, and ""wish him ten faddom deep,"" that is, at the bottom of the sea. On the other hand, they adore Buckingham.
	They are interrupted by the entrance of Buckingham, surrounded by an armed guard and accompanied by Lovell, Vaux, Sands, and common people. Buckingham makes a speech, in which he swears his loyalty to the king and says he does not criticise the law, but ""those that sought it I could wish more Christians"" - a reference to Wolsey. He forgives them, but warns them not to indulge in mischief or use the deaths of more noblemen for their own ends. Lovell asks Buckingham to forgive him, which he does. Buckingham invokes blessings on the king and says he will pray for his long life.
	Vaux wants to make the barge that is to carry Buckingham to his execution fit for a Duke, but Buckingham refuses, saying that his high status is now meaningless. He criticises his ""base accusers,"" who ""never knew what truth meant."" He speaks of his father, who had loyally served Richard III but was betrayed by him. Richard had been succeeded by King Henry VII, who had restored the Buckingham family honors. But now Henry VII's son, Henry VIII, had taken everything from him once again. Buckingham counsels those present to be careful with their friendship and asks them to pray for him. Then he is led away.
	The two Gentlemen comment that if Buckingham is innocent, his accusers will suffer ""curses on their heads."" The Second Gentleman says that evil greater than this is already on the horizon. He has heard a rumor that the king plans to separate from Katherine. He says that Wolsey, out of malice to Katherine, has introduced doubts into the king's mind that threaten to ruin her. Cardinal Campeius, an envoy from the Pope, has arrived to discuss the matter.
	The First Gentleman says that Wolsey is doing this to avenge himself on the Holy Roman Emperor and Katherine's nephew, Charles V, for refusing to make him archbishop of Toledo. The two Gentlemen express sympathy for Katherine and leave to talk in private.
	Analysis
	It is not clear whether Buckingham is genuinely guilty of treason, but the trumped-up nature of his trial is evident from the dubious integrity of most of the witnesses against him. The Surveyor is his former employee, whom he fired and who therefore holds a grudge against him; Car, his confessor, is breaking the sacred trust of the confessional in testifying; and the friar, Hopkins/Henton, fed Buckingham with prophecies that he would be king and must therefore share in his guilt. Because Hopkins/Henton is guilty of inciting treason, he will probably have bought his freedom in exchange for testifying against Buckingham, or perhaps he was tortured into giving evidence. Either way, Hopkins/Henton's testimony is suspect.
	While Buckingham refuses to name names, his comment that he ""could wish more Christians"" those who sought his downfall is a severe indictment of Wolsey, who occupies the position of highest spiritual authority in the land. Buckingham also says that his accusers ""never knew what truth meant"" - again, if true, this is a terrible sin in a senior churchman. Buckingham's accusations of Wolsey carry particular weight because now that he is about to die, he has nothing to gain from lying and to do so would put his soul in peril of damnation. As if to drive home the guilt of Wolsey and his accomplices, after Buckingham exits, the two Gentlemen remark that if he is innocent, then his accusers will suffer ""curses on their heads.""
	Buckingham's invocation of the story of his father, who died for his loyalty to King Richard III, as a direct parallel to his own story, suggests that like his father, he is indeed loyal. This is backed up by the judgment of the common people and the nobility of his final speeches, which emphasize forgiveness of others and a spiritual readiness to die: ""Commend me to his grace, / And if he speaks of Buckingham, pray tell him / You met him half in heaven."" (lines 86-8).

The letter tells how Wolsey's man stole some horses from him that he had purchased on the Lord Chamberlain's behalf, declaring that his master (Wolsey) should have them, rather than a mere subject, or even the king himself. The Lord Chamberlain believes that Wolsey will take everything from the nobles to enrich himself.
	The Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk enter. Suffolk asks after the king, and the Lord Chamberlain says he is troubled in his conscience because he married his brother's wife (Katherine had been married to Henry's older brother Arthur until Arthur died, when she married Henry). Suffolk privately thinks that it is less a matter of conscience than the king's attraction to another woman (Anne Bullen). Norfolk says this is Wolsey's doing. He is amazed that Wolsey has so efficiently managed to break the alliance between Charles V and King Henry, and to make the King doubt the legality of his marriage of twenty years to his loving and virtuous wife, Katherine.
	The Lord Chamberlain says that people everywhere are talking of this, and that they are sad at the news. He says that Wolsey has engineered the situation in order to arrange a marriage between King Henry and the French king's sister. He predicts that one day, God will open the king's eyes so that he can see Wolsey for who he is. Norfolk and Suffolk agree that Wolsey is too proud.
	Norfolk and Suffolk visit the king, with the aim of distracting him from his sad thoughts. When they find him, he is angry at being disturbed. Then Wolsey comes in with Campeius. The king welcomes Wolsey as ""The quiet of my wounded conscience"" (line 74). Wolsey asks the king to give him and Campeius an hour of private conference. The king abruptly dismisses Norfolk and Suffolk. As they leave, they mutter threateningly about Wolsey.
	Wolsey tells the king that no one could object to his separating from Katherine because the king has consulted all the learned clergy of Christendom, including the Pope, who has sent Campeius as his envoy. The king agrees that Katherine should have the best scholars to argue for her. He asks for Gardiner, his new secretary, who was previously employed by Wolsey, to be sent in. As Gardiner enters, he assures Wolsey, in an aside, that his loyalty is still to him.
	Campeius asks Wolsey about Dr Pace, the man who occupied Gardiner's position before him. Campeius tells Wolsey that there are rumors that Wolsey was envious of him and kept him in foreign posts until he went mad with grief and died. Wolsey dismisses Pace as a virtuous fool.
	The king says that he will go to Blackfriars to announce his decision to leave Katherine. He is sorry to leave ""so sweet a bedfellow,"" but his conscience demands it.
	Analysis
	Wolsey's unscrupulous character is further built on in this scene. The episode where Wolsey is reported to have stolen the Lord Chamberlain's horses reinforces what we have learned about his greed and lack of scruple. There was never anything noble or worthy about a horse-thief. In addition, Campeius's account of Wolsey's keeping the previous royal secretary in foreign posts due to envy backs up Wolsey's reputation as a self-promoting schemer. Even Norfolk, who previously had taken a conciliatory attitude towards Wolsey, has now lost patience with him.
	The king is revealed as deluded. He rudely dismisses Norfolk and Suffolk, who are genuinely interested in his welfare, yet welcomes Wolsey as ""The quiet of my wounded conscience"" and ""a cure fit for a king"" (lines 74-5). This praise of Wolsey has dramatic irony (i.e. the audience/reader spots the irony, but the character who utters it is blind to it) in that we know that it was Wolsey who, for his own ends, first introduced doubts into the king's mind about the legality of his marriage to Katherine.
	In Shakespeare's plays, the question, ""Who am I?"" always has deep significance. When the king utters it (line 66), superficially, he is asking Norfolk and Suffolk how they dare disturb a king, but the question has resonance beyond this. He has wrongly allowed his supreme and God-given authority as king to be encroached upon by Wolsey, who ultimately cares only about himself. At the same time, he dismisses his loyal friends, Suffolk and Norfolk. Thus he has lost sight of who he is.
	Though Campeius has brought the Pope's decision on what Henry can or should do about his marriage, it plays little part in what follows. Henry has already made his decision to divorce Katherine, as is made clear by his speech at the end of the scene.

Summary
	Anne Bullen tells the Old Lady how sad it is to think of so good a lady as Katherine being put aside after so many years as queen. She thinks it is better to be low-born and never to have known power than to lose it in this way. She says that she would not want to be a queen. The Old Lady says she is being hypocritical, as it is natural to enjoy wealth and power. While Anne insists that she would not be queen ""for all the riches under heaven,"" the Old Lady says she herself would be queen for a few pennies.
	The Old Lady asks Anne if she would be strong enough to be a duchess. Anne says no. The Old Lady teases her by saying that in that case, she would not be strong enough to bear a male child.
	The Lord Chamberlain comes in and tells Anne that the king's high opinion of her has led him to make her Marchioness of Pembroke and give her a thousand pounds a year. Anne says that she can only offer her thanks in return, and that she prays for the king. As the Lord Chamberlain is leaving, he notes Anne's beauty and honor in an aside to the audience, and says that she may produce an heir for the king.
	The Old Lady says that she has been at court for sixteen years and never gained any advantage from it, whereas Anne has been given all she could wish for without having to try. The Old Lady reminds Anne that she did not want to be a queen. She is incredulous that the king is honoring Anne so highly just out of respect, and wonders if any other obligation is involved. She thinks that perhaps Anne feels strong enough now to be a duchess.
	Anne wonders what will happen next. She asks the Old Lady not to tell Katherine about her new title, and goes off to comfort her.
	Analysis
	The Old Lady's teasing remark that if Anne does not have the strength to be a duchess, she would not have the strength to bear a male child, would have produced wry laughter in an audience of Shakespeare's day. The Old Lady's remark is an arch reference to the fact that Anne was the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, whose birth is the climax of this play. Henry VIII had been gravely disappointed that Anne gave birth to a girl instead of a male heir (Shakespeare reverses the historical truth and has Henry laud Elizabeth's birth as the triumph of his reign). And during the early part of her reign, Elizabeth was plagued by advisors who doubted that a woman could govern a nation successfully. But Elizabeth's great success as a ruler would have given ironic weight to the Old Lady's prediction.
	This is the last time that Anne appears in this play. We learn little about her except that at the beginning of the scene she claims she would not want to be queen, or even a duchess, and yet by the end of the scene has accepted the title Marchioness of Pembroke. Later in the play, she becomes queen. We are not told why she changes her mind, but perhaps it is as the Old Lady suggests - all women like wealth and power. The Old Lady is the voice of experience, set against Anne's voice of innocence.
	Anne's first and last speeches voice her concern about Katherine. On the surface, this shows her compassion. But it also has a deeper resonance for an audience aware of the historical Anne's fate: like Katherine, she too will be discarded by Henry, though Shakespeare does not show this in his play.

Summary
	At Blackfriars, various bishops and officials have convened to decide the question of the king's marriage to Katherine. Wolsey asks for the decision from Rome to be read out, but the king says there is no need as it has already been read, and there is no need to do it again.
	Katherine goes directly to the king and kneels at his feet. She asks for justice and pity, as she is a woman and a foreigner and therefore fears that there is no impartial judge in England. She asks the king how she has offended him, as she has been a true and obedient wife to him. She has been married to him for twenty years, and they have had many children together. If anyone can prove that she has been unfaithful or has failed in her love and duty to the king, then she accepts that she should be turned away. She adds that Henry's father and her father were wise men and judged their marriage to be lawful. She asks that any decision be delayed until she can seek advice from friends in Spain.
	The king does not answer her, but Wolsey tells her that many learned men have come to plead her cause and that delay would be pointless and unsettling to her and the king. Campeius agrees that the proceedings should go ahead immediately.
	Then Katherine addresses Wolsey, telling him that she believes him to be her enemy and so she does not want him to be her judge. She says that he is responsible for stirring up trouble between her and the king. Wolsey says that her comments are out of character for her, as she is known for her gentleness and charity. He denies that he is her enemy and claims that he only acted under the authority of Rome. He also denies that he is responsible for the king's doubts about his marriage, and he hopes that the king will back him up in this.
	Katherine says she is a simple woman and unfitted to oppose Wolsey's cunning. She says that though Wolsey pretends to be humble, he is full of pride and has risen so far above his office (as Cardinal) that many who used to be powerful now act as his servants. She tells him that he cares more about his own status than his spiritual calling. She repeats that she refuses to let him judge her, curtsies to the king, and tries to leave. The king orders that she be brought back into court, but she insists that she will never again appear in court to discuss this matter, and leaves.
	The king allows her to go, and reflects that no man had a better wife. He praises her nobility and obedience. Wolsey asks the king whether he had, as Katherine alleged, induced the king to doubt his marriage. The king excuses Wolsey from Katherine's accusations and goes on to explain how he came to doubt the legality of his marriage. The French ambassador, the Bishop of Bayonne, had come to negotiate a marriage between Mary, the daughter of King Henry and Katherine, and the Duke of Orleans. The ambassador had asked whether Mary were legitimate, given that Katherine had previously been married to Henry's brother (the Bible forbids a man to marry his dead brother's wife). The question had awakened doubts in the king. He had reflected that Katherine had given birth to sons, but they had been born dead or died shortly afterwards. He felt that this was a judgment on him for contracting a marriage that was unlawful in God's eyes. He then thought about the danger to his kingdom if it were left without an heir. After a great struggle, his conscience had driven him to the solution of divorcing Katherine.
	The king had then consulted with the Bishop of Lincoln, whom he now asks to speak. The Bishop of Lincoln confirms that he advised the king to divorce Katherine. The king says he had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to decide the case in court, which the Archbishop had granted. The king insists that it is not out of dislike for Katherine that he has come to this, but out of conscience. If his marriage were proven lawful, he would be happy to remain married to her.
	Campeius says that the court must adjourn until Katherine can be persuaded to return. He also says that Katherine must not appeal to the Pope. The king suspects that the cardinals are just using delaying tactics. He looks forward to the return of Bishop Cranmer, his trusted advisor. The court breaks up.
	Analysis
	The trial to decide the legality of the marriage between Katherine and the king is as dubious as that convened to convict Buckingham. It is a mere formality. The king has already decided to divorce Katherine, as is revealed by his dismissal of Wolsey's request to have read out the papal decision that Campeius has brought from Rome.
	The fact that the king has already made his decision is reinforced by his failure to speak even a single word in reply to Katherine's impassioned plea. The cardinals Wolsey and Campeius speak for him. This also reveals the extent to which the king has ceded his authority to Wolsey.
	Katherine once again reveals herself to be the most clear-sighted person at court. She sees Wolsey's essence as the king cannot; he ignores her words about Wolsey. It is also worthy of note that Katherine's speech is as direct and clear as Wolsey's is convoluted and obscure. Wolsey is at his most mealy-mouthed when it comes to taking responsibility for his actions. While earlier, we saw Wolsey falsely claiming credit for the king's repeal of the tax, here we see him attempting to avoid censure for breaking up Katherine's marriage to the king. He shifts the responsibility onto all the cardinals of Christendom, right up to the Pope. Katherine knows that she is no match for Wolsey's cunning, and she can only withdraw from a court she knows to be partial and corrupt.
	In spite of Wolsey's appeal to the authority of the learned cardinals and the Pope, we never learn what the Pope says. This is because it is irrelevant. The divorce is a foregone conclusion, engineered by Wolsey and embraced by the king, who is impatient to replace Katherine. The king tries to convince himself and everybody else that he is pursuing the divorce because of the dictates of conscience and concern for the good of the kingdom. But this claim has already been brought into doubt by Suffolk in Act 2, scene 2, when he says that the king's attraction to Anne is the more pressing reason. Of course, both reasons may apply, but Shakespeare leaves it to the audience to decide which is paramount.
	Buckingham was the first to fall; Katherine is the second. Wolsey is behind both these events.

Summary
	Katherine is sewing with her ladies-in-waiting. She asks one of them to sing. The woman sings a song about the power of music to heal sorrow.
	A Gentleman enters and tells Katherine that the cardinals want to speak with her. As Katherine asks him to show them in, she worries about what they want with her. Wolsey and Campeius enter. Wolsey asks her if they can speak in a private room, but she says that her conscience is clear, so she is happy to speak here. Wolsey begins to speak to her in Latin, but she stops him, saying that it could make people think that there is something about her cause which must be hidden. She asks him to speak in English, for all to hear.
	Wolsey says that they have come not to accuse her, but to know her intentions in the matter of the divorce, and to give her advice and comfort. Campeius says that Wolsey, out of nobility of spirit, has forgiven Katherine for her false accusations against him, and has come to offer help. Katherine is not convinced, saying in an aside to the audience that they have come to betray her. She tells the cardinals that she needs more time to seek counsel before she can give an answer on such an important matter. She tells them she is ""a woman friendless, hopeless"" (line 80). Wolsey insists that she has both friends and hopes, but she points out that no Englishman would dare to help her, as to do so would be to oppose the king. Those friends she has, she says, are in Spain.
	Campeius and Wolsey advise her to place herself under the king's protection, since if the court's judgment goes against her, she risks being disgraced. Katherine tells them that they both wish her ruin, but that there is a higher judge that no king can corrupt - God. She says that she thought them holy men, but now sees that they are heartless and full of sin. She feels that they are enjoying seeing her misery, but warns them to be careful, lest her misfortune rebounds on them. She asks them why she should place her cause in the hands of the king, who hates her. He has banished her from his bed, and she lost his love long ago. She is old, she says, and her relationship with the king consists merely of her obedience. She has been a loving and constant wife, yet she is rewarded by being rejected. Nothing but death will separate her from her ""dignities"" - her royal title of queen and, presumably, her marriage to the king. Katherine wishes that she had never come to England. She worries about what will become of her and her ladies.
	Wolsey protests that he and Campeius mean well, and that she is wrong in her suspicions about them. He warns her that she may damage her cause with the king by her stubborn attitude. Campeius insists that the king loves her and that they only wish to do her service. Katherine tells them to do as they will, and sarcastically says that if she has misunderstood their intentions, it is because she is only a woman, lacking understanding. She says she still loves the king and prays for him.
	Analysis
	Katherine, unlike Buckingham, is not prepared to go quietly to her fate. She puts up a strong fight, accusing the cardinals of plotting to betray her and enjoying seeing her suffer. In fact, we do not know the real motives of the cardinals on this occasion or whether they are genuinely trying to help her, as they claim.
	Several times, Katherine contrasts the holy exteriors of the cardinals with their corrupt inner nature. At lines 103-4, she puns on the clergy title of ""cardinal,"" which Wolsey and Campeius both have, and the ""cardinal (meaning principal or chief) virtues"" and ""cardinal sins,"" as defined by the church. There are seven cardinal virtues: faith, hope, love, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance; and seven cardinal sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lust. While Wolsey and Campeius appear to be ""two reverend cardinal virtues,"" she fears that instead they are ""cardinal sins and hollow hearts."" Then, at line 117, she questions whether the two cardinals are ""anything but churchmen's habits"" - that is, whether they have only the external appearance of holiness and not the inner quality. At line 145, once again taking up this theme of external appearance and inner reality, she says, ""Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.""
	Katherine's fate is particularly harsh in the light of her having done nothing wrong. She has been a faultless wife and still loves Henry. He is getting rid of her because she has failed to give him a male heir, because he desires Anne, and because Wolsey is engineering the divorce. From the point of view of the play's grand purpose, however, Katherine's 'fault' is that she is not the mother of Elizabeth. Therefore she must make way for Anne.

Summary
	Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and the Lord Chamberlain are discussing the problem of Wolsey. Norfolk believes that if they all unite against Wolsey, he cannot survive. The alternative, he says, is more disgrace. The Lord Chamberlain says that they must bar Wolsey's access to the king if they want to make any sort of attack on him, since he has the king as if under his spell. Norfolk says that the king is already displeased with Wolsey, as he has evidence of his double-dealing in the divorce. Wolsey had written letters to the Pope asking him to delay his decision on the divorce until the king had got over his infatuation with Anne. Wolsey's letters were intercepted by the king.
	The Lord Chamberlain reveals that the king has already married Anne. Suffolk confirms that her coronation as queen has been arranged. Suffolk praises Anne and says that he believes she will bring blessings to England. He adds that Campeius has displeased the king by leaving for Rome without the king's permission and without having assisted in the divorce. He says that Cranmer is about to return from his tour of the famous colleges, where he has been collecting churchmen's opinions on the divorce. These opinions have supported the king. Soon, news of the king's marriage to Anne will be published. Katherine will lose her title of queen and will be called the princess dowager, and Prince Arthur's widow. Norfolk praises Cranmer for having taken such pains with the king's business. Suffolk predicts that Cranmer will be promoted to Archbishop.
	Wolsey enters with his servant, Cromwell. The Lords observe them, unseen by Wolsey. Wolsey asks Cromwell if his letters have been given to the king. Cromwell confirms that they have, and the king read them with a serious air. Cromwell leaves, and Wolsey muses that the king must marry the French king's sister, not Anne Bullen. Anne is a passionate Lutheran (and therefore a Protestant, as against Wolsey's Catholicism), and will obstruct Wolsey. Wolsey worries too about the growing influence of Cranmer, another Protestant, over the king.
	The king and Lovell enter. The king is reading a document that reveals the enormous wealth that Wolsey has accumulated. The king asks the Lords whether they have seen Wolsey. They say that they have been observing him, and that he seems very agitated. The king says this may be because an inventory of Wolsey's possessions has, probably mistakenly, been included in some state papers he had sent to the king. The king is amazed that a subject could accumulate such wealth. He suspects that Wolsey right now is musing on worldly, rather than spiritual, matters.
	Lovell summons Wolsey to the king. The king says to Wolsey that his mind must be so full of spiritual matters that he has no time to look after worldly responsibilities. Wolsey says that he allots some time to spiritual matters, some to affairs of state, and some to the demands of the body (sleep, eating, etc.). The king says that Wolsey speaks well. He goes on to say that his father, Henry VII, thought highly of Wolsey, and he himself has employed him as his closest aide. Wolsey, unnerved at where this conversation might be heading, points out that he has worked only for the good of the king and the state, and that the king's favor has been payment enough for his labors.
	The king says Wolsey has answered well, though it is clear that he doubts his integrity. The king says that a loyal subject is rewarded with honor, and a disloyal one with dishonor. Wolsey repeats that he has always worked for the king's good, not his own. Again, the king commends Wolsey's reply. He gives Wolsey the papers he has intercepted and leaves, followed by the Lords, who are smiling happily at these developments.
	Left alone, Wolsey examines the papers. When he finds the inventory of his wealth, he realizes that this has caused the king's anger. He admits that he has built up wealth for his own ends, specifically, to bribe his friends in Rome to gain the position of Pope. Then he finds his letter to the Pope, asking him to delay his decision on the divorce. He knows that he is ruined.
	Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and the Lord Chamberlain enter. Norfolk has been sent by the king to order Wolsey to hand back his seal of office and confine himself to his house. But Wolsey is unwilling to obey without a written warrant from the king. He accuses the Lords of envy and refuses to give up the seal except into the king's own hands. Surrey accuses Wolsey of having brought about the death of his father-in-law, Buckingham, and having sent him, Surrey, to Ireland, so that he could not seek justice. Wolsey protests that he is innocent of the death of Buckingham, who was convicted under the law by a jury. Surrey angrily replies that if Wolsey were not protected by his churchman's office, he would kill him. Surrey reminds Wolsey that he has gained wealth by extortion from the nobles, and dealt with the Pope against the king's interests. Norfolk tells Wolsey that he has a list of articles, written by the king, enumerating Wolsey's misdeeds. Wolsey insists that he will be able to prove his innocence to the king. Suffolk says he remembers some of the king's complaints against Wolsey, and Wolsey will not be able to save himself.
	The Lords begin to read out the list of articles against Wolsey drawn up by the king. First, Wolsey made himself the Pope's representative without the king's consent. Second, in letters to Rome and foreign monarchs, he wrote, ""I and my king,"" implying that the king was his servant. The Lords read out other crimes that Wolsey is guilty of, including having his cardinal's hat stamped on the king's coins and bribing the Pope. The Lord Chamberlain, feeling sorry for Wolsey, stops the Lords from reading any further, saying that they must leave him to the law. Surrey says he forgives Wolsey. Suffolk tells Wolsey that the king has ordered that all Wolsey's property should be forfeited and that he is no longer under the king's protection. Norfolk tells Wolsey that the king will be informed about his unwillingness to give up his seal of office, and the Lords leave him on his own to ponder on ""how to live better.""
	Wolsey reflects that his life has been like that of a plant, which grows, blooms, and then is killed by a sudden frost. He also compares himself to little boys who swim out of their depth, using swim bladders to keep them afloat. His pride has burst, just as swim bladders can burst, and has now left him at the mercy of the ""rude stream"" (lline 364) of events. He denounces the vain glories of this world, and feels that his heart has been ""new open'd."" Those who depend on royal favors are in a precarious position, and when they fall, it is as Lucifer fell from heaven, ""Never to hope again"" (line 372).
	Cromwell enters and weeps at Wolsey's fate. But Wolsey tells him he is now at peace and has never been happier. He knows himself now. The king has cured him (of the disease of pride), for which he is thankful. He feels strong enough to endure even more miseries, and certainly more than his enemies could offer. Cromwell reports to Wolsey that Sir Thomas More is to replace him as Lord Chancellor, and that Cranmer has been welcomed home, and made Archbishop of Canterbury. Lastly, he reports that Anne Bullen, who has been secretly married to the king for some time, has appeared in public for the first time as queen and that her coronation is expected soon.
	Wolsey realizes that Anne has been his downfall. He tells Cromwell to leave him, as he is ""a poor fall'n man,"" and to go to the king, who will promote him. Cromwell cannot bear to leave his master. He tells him that though the king shall have his service, Wolsey shall have his prayers. Wolsey is moved to tears. He tells Cromwell that when he is dead and forgotten, he must tell the world that Wolsey showed him an honorable route to success - one that Wolsey himself had missed. He advises Cromwell to reject ambition, to love himself last, to value his enemies, and to remember that honesty will serve him better than corruption. He must serve his country, God, and truth. If he does all this and still falls, then ""Thou fall'st a blessed martyr."" He asks Cromwell to take the inventory of his possessions to the king, who now owns them all. He ends by saying that if he had served God with half the zeal with which he served his king, God would not have abandoned him to his enemies. His hopes now are fixed on heaven.
	Analysis
	This scene tracks Wolsey's fall. Until now, we have seen Wolsey largely through the eyes of his enemies, and this tradition is continued into the beginning of this scene, when we see the Lords delighting in the fact that the king has found evidence against Wolsey and anticipating his downfall. But with Wolsey's entrance, at last we see him speak for himself. As is usual with Shakespeare, the more we learn of him, the more we are able to see his human and sympathetic aspects alongside his less admirable qualities.
	When we first see Wolsey, he still believes he is at the height of his powers. The impression we gain of him is largely unsympathetic. We see him plotting to marry off the king to the French king's sister and dismissing Anne Bullen as unsuitable. In terms of the grand purpose of the play, this is unacceptable, as Anne is necessary in order to give birth to Elizabeth. His interaction with the king also shows him in a bad light. He claims that all his actions have been for the good of the king and the state and his only reward the king's ""graces,"" whereas we are aware that the king holds in his hand an inventory of Wolsey's massive wealth. In this respect, he is dishonest.
	It is a brilliant stroke on Shakespeare's part to have the king refrain from confronting Wolsey about his dishonesty directly. Instead, the king merely praises Wolsey's noble-sounding speeches, and as he leaves, gives to Wolsey his own inventory of possessions. Wolsey only has to see the paper to know that his career is no more. In this way, Shakespeare gives the impression that it is not the hostility of the king that brings Wolsey down, but Wolsey's own overweening pride, of which the king cures him. This is confirmed by Wolsey later in the scene, when he says, ""The king has cur'd me, / I humbly thank his grace"" (lines 380-1).
	Wolsey's subsequent interaction with the Lords is psychologically revealing and shows him in an even worse light than his interaction with the king. From the time he sees his letter to the Pope in the packet intercepted by the king, he knows that he is ruined (lines 222-7). But he treats the Lords, who have been sent by the king, with reckless contempt, refusing to surrender the seal of office to anyone but the king in person. His taunting question, ""Now, who'll take it?"" (line 250) is reminiscent of the challenge a school bully in possession of the ball might shout to other smaller or weaker boys. His action is also extraordinarily inappropriate for a churchman, who is not supposed to form attachments to worldly things and is certainly not supposed physically to hang onto his badge of office when the king has requested him to give it up. However, at the same time, the indignity of the incident awakens our pity for Wolsey, unable to give up the symbol of the high office he has striven to gain.
	With the Lords, Wolsey continues to avoid taking responsibility for his actions, telling Surrey that the law, not he, was responsible for Buckingham's execution - a similar excuse to the one he used for the unfair taxes in Act 1. He also insists that the king will exonerate him when he knows of his loyalty - another dishonest claim, since he has already proclaimed his loyalty to the king and not been believed.
	When Wolsey is left alone by the Lords, he begins his journey into self-awareness. He compares himself to a small boy who, lulled into a false sense of security by using inflated bladders to keep him afloat, swims out of his depth only to find that the bladders have burst, leaving him without support. His pride was his swim bladder, keeping him afloat: now that the king has burst it, he is left to the mercy of the ""rude stream"" of fate. He also compares himself to Lucifer, who fell from heaven, ""Never to hope again"" (line 372). Though this image adds to the whiff of devilry surrounding Wolsey, it also vividly portrays the depth of his despair and the extent of his self-condemnation for his vanity.
	Wolsey is most sympathetic in the last part of his final scene. The lords have told Wolsey of the king's order that all his goods will be forfeit, and that he will no longer enjoy the king's protection. He has no worldly goods or status. But as so often in Shakespeare (e.g. in King Lear and As You Like It), this is the perfect time for him to achieve peace and self-knowledge. Left alone by the lords, Wolsey renounces the ""vain pomp and glory of this world"" and says, significantly, ""I feel my heart new open'd"" (lines 365-6). This last statement paves the way for what happens next.
	Wolsey's servant, Cromwell, comes in. A silence falls upon the stage. When Cromwell sees the broken Wolsey, he begins to weep in sympathy. It is plain that, whatever Wolsey's faults were, he was loved by his servant. Cromwell only wants to know how Wolsey is - after so much language has been spent in lying, equivocation and power-play, it is moving to hear words spoken in a spirit of pure love and acceptance. It is no coincidence that it is in this context that Wolsey, finally freed from his habits of grasping and manipulation, replies from a place of perfect serenity, ""Why, well; / Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell; / I know myself now, and I feel within me / A peace above all earthly dignities, / A still and quiet conscience. The king has cur'd me."" (lines 376-80). He goes on to counsel Cromwell to renounce ambition and work only for God, his country and the truth. Self-knowledge is invariably the highest good in Shakespeare's plays, and Wolsey achieves it, though via a difficult path and at the expense of many others, including Buckingham, Katherine and the nobles he impoverished.

Summary
	The two Gentlemen meet in the street. They are waiting to see Anne pass by on her way back from her coronation. The Second Gentleman recalls that the last time they met, it was to see Buckingham coming from his trial. That was an occasion of sorrow, whereas this is one of joy. They discuss who is to be promoted today: Suffolk is to be made high steward, and Norfolk earl marshal. The First Gentleman reports that Cranmer has held another court to decide the matter of the divorce. Katherine was often called, but refused to attend. The court ruled that the king and Katherine were divorced, and she has been moved to the country, where she is now ill. The Second Gentleman expresses pity for her. They are interrupted by Anne's coronation procession, which includes Suffolk, Norfolk, Anne, and other nobles and officials.
	The Second Gentleman remarks on Anne's beauty. A third Gentleman arrives. He has seen the ceremony and describes it to the others, emphasizing Anne's beauty and the people's joy. Anne was crowned by Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The coronation feast is being held in Wolsey's former house, which is now the king's and renamed Whitehall. The Second Gentleman says that Gardiner has been promoted from the king's secretary to Bishop of Winchester. He adds that Gardiner does not like Cranmer. The Third Gentleman says that this does not matter, as Cranmer has a good friend in Cromwell, whom the king so respects that he has made him master of the jewel house and a member of the privy council.
	Scene 2 opens at Kimbolton, where a sick Katherine is led in by Griffith, her servant, and Patience, her maid. Griffith asks how she is, and she replies that she is deathly ill. She has heard that Wolsey is dead, which Griffith confirms. She asks how he died. Griffith says that the Earl of Northumberland arrested him at York, but on his way to answer the charges against him, he fell sick and died a penitent man in the abbey at Leicester. Katherine says she will speak of him charitably, but goes on to describe his ambition, arrogance, lying and underhand dealing. She also criticizes his habit of ambiguity in speech and his lack of pity for others, and says he set a bad example for the clergy.
	Griffith asks Katherine's permission to speak about Wolsey's good points, which she gladly grants. He says that he rose from humble stock, was a fine scholar from his earliest years, and was clever in speech. He was rude to those who disliked him, but sweet to those who asked him for help. He founded two colleges at Ipswich and Oxford, one of which survived his death, and became renowned throughout Christendom. Finally, Griffith suggests that he was happiest after his fall: he achieved self-knowledge and found the blessedness of being little"" (line 66).
	Katherine is impressed by Griffith's honest but appreciative speech and says she wishes that he would speak about her after her death. He has brought her to honor Wolsey, whom she hated when he was alive. She wishes him peace. She tells her attendants that she is near death, then asks for music and falls asleep.
	Katherine sees a vision of six people dressed in white, apparently spirits, wearing gold masks and garlands round their heads. They dance around Katherine and hold a garland over her head. As if inspired, in her sleep, she holds up her hands joyously to heaven. The dancers vanish and Katherine wakes, sad that the spirits have left her behind. She asks her attendants where they are, but they have seen no one. She tells them that the spirits invited her to a banquet and promised her eternal happiness. Her attendants see that she is dying.
	A Messenger comes in and says that the king has sent a gentleman to see her. Lord Capuchius, an ambassador from Katherine's nephew, King Charles V of Spain, enters. Capuchius brings words of comfort from the king, who is concerned for Katherine in her illness. Katherine says his comfort comes too late; she is past all comfort except for prayers. She asks after the king's health and wishes him well. Then she asks her maid to bring the letter she wrote to the king. In her letter, Katherine asks the king to look after their daughter, Mary, and to love her. She also asks the king to look after her ladies-in-waiting, who have been loyal, and to find them good husbands. Finally, she asks the king to pay her manservants. She asks Capuchius to remind the king of her ""in all humility"", that she will no longer be a trouble to him and that she blessed him as she was dying. She asks her ladies to help her to bed.
	Analysis
	In the street scene, Shakespeare deliberately juxtaposes the fall of one of the king's favorites with the rise of another. A Gentleman recalls that the last time they met, it was to see Buckingham on his way from his trial; this time, it is to see Anne coming from her coronation. And no sooner does a Gentleman ask after Katherine and receive his answer that she is sick, than her replacement, Anne, appears in full coronation regalia. There could be no clearer indication of the transient nature of royal favor.
	Katherine and Griffith act as a chorus in this scene, with Katherine enumerating Wolsey's faults and sins, and Griffith emphasizing his good points. In line with the play's theme of forgiveness triumphing over accusation and recrimination, Katherine is able to forgive Wolsey after hearing Griffith speak well of him.
	Neither Wolsey nor Katherine lives for long after being cast off by the king. Katherine, like Wolsey, makes a 'good' death, as is made plain by her heavenly vision of spirits promising eternal happiness. The vision comes after she forgives Wolsey. This is not coincidence but a sign that Katherine has prepared herself for heaven partly by her act of forgiveness. The name of her maid, Patience, is also significant, as this is the quality that Katherine most has need of at this point in her life, hence her lines, ""Nay Patience, / You must not leave me yet"" (lines 165-6). She emphatically lacked patience when she stormed out of the courtroom at her trial (Act 2, scene 4), but feels that she has cultivated it by Act 3, scene 1, line 138, when she boasts of her ""great patience.""
	Patience is a quality that several of the characters are forced to learn. Buckingham at the start of the play lacks it, perhaps to a fatal degree, as we see in his hotheaded attempt to rush off and tell the king about Wolsey's alleged treason - before he is counseled by Norfolk to exercise restraint. In his speech before his execution, he expresses forgiveness of his accusers and acceptance of his state. Cranmer already has it in abundance, as we shall see in Act 5, scene 2, where he is forced to wait outside the council chamber door in spite of the fact that he is a council member. He does so without anger.
	Another notable character trait of Katherine is her generosity, as shown by her concern for the welfare of her servants after her death.

Summary
	It is one o'clock at night. Bishop Gardiner enters with his Page. Lovell rushes in. Gardiner asks why he is in haste, and Lovell reveals that Queen Anne is in labor, and it is feared that she may not survive. Gardiner says that he prays for the baby, but believes that Anne is not of good enough stock to provide the heir to the throne. He says that things will not go well for England until Anne and her two allies, Cranmer and Cromwell, are dead. Lovell points out that Cranmer and Cromwell are the two men most favored by the king. But Gardiner says that he has already told the council that Cranmer is a heretic, and the king has ordered the council to convene tomorrow morning to examine him. Gardiner says that Cranmer is a ""rank weed,"" ""And we must root him out"" (lines 52-3).
	The king and Suffolk enter. The king asks Lovell how Anne's labor is progressing. Lovell delivers a message from Anne asking the king to pray for her. The king is concerned and asks to be left alone. Suffolk leaves.
	Sir Anthony Denny brings in Cranmer, who is worried by the king's frown. The king tells Cranmer that he has heard some serious complaints about him, and that he must come before the council tomorrow morning to answer them. The king warns Cranmer that he will not be able to prove his innocence instantly, and so while the complaints are being investigated he may have to be patient and accept imprisonment in the Tower of London. Cranmer thanks the king for the warning, and says he knows he is subject to many malicious rumors. He says he does not fear anything that can be said against him, and will rely upon his truth and honesty. But the king warns him that he has powerful enemies and it is possible that corrupt witnesses will be brought to testify against him. Cranmer hopes that God and the king will protect him, or he will certainly fall into the trap that is laid for him.
	The king advises Cranmer to use his persuasive powers to avoid imprisonment. He gives Cranmer a ring and tells him to show it to the council if they try to imprison him. The council will then have to allow Cranmer's appeal to be heard by the king himself. Cranmer is overcome with gratitude, and weeps. The king swears he is honest and says there is not a better soul in his kingdom. Cranmer leaves.
	An Old Lady enters with the news that Anne has given birth. He demands to be told that it is a boy, so the Old Lady agrees that it is a boy. She quickly adds that it is, in fact, a girl who ""promises boys hereafter"" (line 166), and who looks exactly like him. The king rushes off to see the baby, who is the future Queen Elizabeth I.
	Analysis
	At the first murmurings of discontent about Cranmer from Gardiner, we know that it is Cranmer's turn to fall. Gardiner seems to have no real reason for denouncing Cranmer, and we can only surmise that he does so out of loyalty to his old master, Wolsey. Cranmer's sudden fall from the court's favor seems even more arbitrary than the falls of his predecessors - Buckingham, Katherine, and Wolsey.
	One difference between Cranmer's fall and that of the others is that the king forms an independent opinion of him and decides to actively help him. We are not told why this is, but it could be that the king genuinely believes Cranmer to be innocent and thus wants him to keep his position. Another factor which certainly plays a part is that the king is at last free from the ""witchcraft"" (Act 3, scene 2, line 18) of Wolsey's influence, and has taken full control of his realm.
	The Old Lady's statement that Anne has given birth to a boy, which she rapidly amends to a girl who ""promises boys hereafter,"" would have raised a laugh among all those who remembered Queen Elizabeth I. In fact, Henry's only son, Edward VI, died young, leaving Henry's and Katherine's daughter Mary to inherit the throne. When Mary died childless, Elizabeth was proclaimed queen. It took time and determination for Elizabeth to convince her advisors and subjects that a woman could rule England, and without a husband at her side, and do it well - but she still felt that she had to apologise for being a mere ""weak and feeble woman.""

Summary
	Cranmer arrives at the council chamber, hoping he is not late. But the doorkeeper will not let him in, saying he must wait outside the door until he is called. Dr Butts, the king's physician, sees how Cranmer is being treated, and condemns it as malice, since Cranmer is himself a member of the council. Butts leaves to tell the king what has happened.
	Cranmer is unnerved by Butts' concerned look; he hopes it does not mean he is about to be disgraced. He is now certain that this is a trap set for him by his enemies. Butts leads the king to a window from where they can observe events, and shows him how Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is being kept waiting outside the door with the servants. The king is surprised that one so much favored by him should be humiliated in this way. He says that it is a good thing that his authority exceeds that of the council.
	The Lord Chancellor leads in the nobles who constitute the council. Cranmer is finally allowed in. The Lord Chancellor tells Cranmer that he is here because he has been teaching dangerous and heretical new ideas around the kingdom. Gardiner goes further, alleging that Cranmer must be stopped from spreading such ideas immediately or revolutions and riots will break out, as has already happened in continental Europe. Cranmer says that he has been careful not to stir up trouble with his teachings, and has always opposed those who do. He believes he is the victim of envy and malice, and asks to be brought face-to-face with his accusers so that he can debate them openly. But Suffolk points out that because Cranmer is a council member, no one can accuse him of anything.
	Gardiner breaks in, saying that they have more important business to get on with, and so he will be brief. The king and the council wish Cranmer to be imprisoned in the Tower, which will reduce to the status of a common man once more, so that his accusers can charge him openly. Cranmer sarcastically thanks Gardiner for his kindness, and says that he sees that Gardiner is out to ruin him. He counsels Gardiner that love and humility are more fitting for a churchman than ambition. He says he has no doubt that he can clear himself. Gardiner accuses Cranmer of being an adherent of a sect (Protestantism). Cromwell rebukes Gardiner for being too sharp to ""a falling man."" Gardiner turns his attack on Cromwell, accusing him of favoring the same ""new sect"" as Cranmer.
	The Lord Chancellor silences the men and gives the order for Cranmer to be taken to the Tower. Gardiner calls in the Guard. Cranmer is shocked that he is being taken away like a traitor. He asks to speak first, and shows them the king's ring, saying that it gives him the right to be heard by the king himself. The council members see that they underestimated how much Cranmer enjoyed the king's favor. Suffolk confirms that the ring is the king's and reminds the others that he told them, when they first moved against Cranmer, that it would rebound on them. Norfolk agrees that the king will not allow Cranmer to be harmed. Cromwell says he suspected that no good would come of trying to build a case against Cranmer, whose honesty is renowned.
	At that moment, the king, who has left the window from which he was observing the council meeting, enters. Gardiner greets the king in a flattering speech, but the king is not impressed, saying that this is no time for flattery. The king says that Gardiner cannot hide his misdeeds and his cruel nature. He had thought that the council members were men of wisdom, but now he sees that they are not. He says they were wrong to make Cranmer wait outside the door like a servant. He gave the council authority to try Cranmer as an equal, not an inferior, but he sees that some of them are pursuing him out of malice. The Lord Chancellor protests that they were only planning to imprison Cranmer in order to give him a fair trial. The king says that he himself owes much to Cranmer, and orders the council members to embrace him and be friends. Then he asks Cranmer to baptize his daughter, Elizabeth. Gardiner does not immediately embrace Cranmer, so the king asks him again. Gardiner does so, ""with a true heart."" Cranmer weeps and gives thanks. The king says that what everyone says about Cranmer is true: a man may do him an injury, and he is his friend forever. The king urges the council members to remain unified and leads them all off to the baptism.
	Analysis
	For the first time, a person who is set up to fall does not do so. Buckingham, Katherine and Wolsey all succumbed, but Cranmer escapes a similar, seemingly inevitable, fate. This is because Cranmer is the only one who has done nothing wrong. Whereas Buckingham may have had treasonous intentions, Cranmer is universally renowned for his honesty and integrity. Gardiner's objection to Cranmer - that he teaches heresy - would have been roundly discredited in the eyes of Shakespeare's officially Protestant audience because Gardiner is a sworn ally of the Catholic Wolsey and Cranmer is one of the pioneers of Protestantism. Henry VIII began the movement towards Protestantism when he created himself head of the Church of England (independent of the authority of the Pope) in order to get his divorce from Katherine and marry Anne. Cranmer supported the king in this process. When Henry's daughter Elizabeth came to the throne, she made Protestantism the official religion of England, a move that helped unify the nation and ended years of sectarian unrest. Thus, in terms of the grand purpose of the play - celebrating the arrival of the Protestant Elizabeth - Cranmer was on the 'right' side of history and could not be punished. Wolsey and Katherine, on the other hand, with their Catholic allegiance to the Pope and opposition to the king's marriage to Anne, were on the 'wrong' side and stood in the way of Elizabeth's destiny. Thus, they had to go.
	Another reason why Cranmer survives is that the king, for the first time in the series of falls, takes a fully active role. In the trial of Buckingham, the king was essentially Wolsey's puppet, unquestioningly believing suspect witnesses and ignoring Katherine's warnings of partiality. At Katherine's trial, the king also took a back seat. He expressed sadness at losing such a good wife, but would not engage with her and went along with his advisors - driven partly, of course, by his attraction to Anne and need for an heir. With Wolsey, the king is more active, but the type of action is significant: he merely listens politely to Wolsey's protestations of goodness and loyalty before silently handing to him his own incriminating letters. The sense is that Wolsey has undone himself by his own double-dealing and greed; the king has merely been the messenger. Moreover, the king takes no further part in Wolsey's fate.
	But the matter is different with Cranmer. In giving Cranmer his ring, the king ensures that whatever happens at the council meeting, the archbishop will be under his protection. Sure enough, as soon as Cranmer produces the ring, the council members know their game is up. The king has been watching the council proceedings unseen, and we in turn have been watching the king. It is as if the extra eyes and ears following the proceedings throw them open to daylight and end the dark machinations that have been going on. The king enters the council chamber, rebukes the members for pursuing the innocent Cranmer, and orders them to reconcile with him. In asking Cranmer to baptize Elizabeth, the king shows everyone how much he honors Cranmer, and shifts the focus from petty persecutions and resentments to joy at the new life and hope that Elizabeth represents, and her future reign of peace and prosperity.

Summary
	A large crowd of people has gathered at the court entrance to see the baby Elizabeth, who is being christened today. A Porter is trying in vain to keep the crowd away from the entrance so that the royal party can pass through. The Lord Chamberlain enters and rebukes the Porter for not ensuring that there will be enough room for the ladies of the christening party to pass. He says the Porter and his men are lazy, and tells them to make room or face prison.
	Trumpets sound to announce the arrival of the royal party. The Porter shouts at the crowd to make way. The procession enters, with the Duchess of Norfolk carrying the princess Elizabeth under the royal canopy. The king enters.
	Cranmer makes a speech in which he prophesies a great future for Elizabeth. She will bring many blessings to the nation and will be an example of good government for her successors. She will be virtuous, loved and respected. England will enjoy peace and prosperity under her reign. She will die a virgin, and, as the mythical phoenix is reborn out of its own ashes, her successor will inherit her greatness, and found new nations (a reference to the English colonization of America, which started in earnest in James I's reign).
	The King is pleased with Cranmer's words. He feels that producing Elizabeth was his greatest accomplishment. He says that after he is dead, he will take delight in watching what Elizabeth does from heaven. He leads the party off to greet the queen.
	The Epilogue enters and says he is sure that the play could not have pleased everyone. Some came to sleep, but have been woken up by the trumpets, so they will not be pleased. Others came to see the ordinary citizens made fun of, but they will have been disappointed. The only people who will be pleased with the play are good women, who will be happy at seeing another good woman portrayed in the character of Katherine. And if they like the play, and clap, then their men will feel they have to follow.
	Analysis
	Cranmer's speech prophesying Elizabeth's great future is the climax of the play and the end to which all the plotlines have been leading. Henry's delight in his daughter as his greatest achievement also excuses, by implication, the mistakes and relative chaos of his reign. His role was ultimately to bring her into the world.
	Cranmer also predicts that all Elizabeth's good qualities will be carried on in her heir, James I, who ruled England at the time when Henry VIII was written. Shakespeare is complimenting James by describing him as the worthy successor to Elizabeth.

	The Merry Wives of Windsor begins with Justice Shallow complaining to Sir Hugh Evans that he has been abused by Falstaff. Shallow's cousin Slender backs him up, and Evans agrees to take up the matter on Shallow's behalf.
	Evans then changes the subject, and mentions Anne Page, a girl of marriageable age. Anne has inherited, or will inherit, a sizable amount of money, which makes her a desirable bride. Evans wants to arrange a match between Anne and Slender.
	They go the house of George Page, Anne's father. Falstaff is inside, and Shallow tells Page that Falstaff has wronged him. Page replies that Falstaff has admitted as much.
	Falstaff enters with his cronies, Bardolph, Nym and Pistol. Shallow accuses Falstaff of beating his men, killing his deer and breaking into his lodge. Falstaff admits it, but when Shallow says he will take the matter to the Council, Falstaff tells him he will be laughed at. Slender then says that Bardolph, Nym and Pistol carried him to the tavern, got him drunk, and then picked his pocket.
	Evans replies that he, Page, and the Host of the Garter Inn should arbitrate the matter. Questioned by Falstaff, Pistol denies that he robbed Slender. Bardolph claims that Slender was too drunk to know what was happening and has drawn the wrong conclusion, while Slender vows that in future, he will only get drunk in the company of righteous people, not drunken rogues.
	Anne Page enters with her mother, and Mrs. Ford. Page invites all the company to have dinner with them, and everyone exits except Shallow, Slender and Evans. Evans and Shallow want to know whether Slender thinks he would be able to love Anne Page. Slender agrees to do whatever is expected of him, including marrying the girl. He expresses no great enthusiasm for the prospect, though.
	Anne Page enters and invites them to the dinner table. Shallow and Evans exit, leaving Anne alone with Slender. She tries to persuade him to come to dinner, but Slender says he is not hungry. He is only persuaded when Page returns and summons him, but even then he insists that Anne go in first.
	In scene 2, Evans gives Simple, Slender's servant, a letter to deliver to Mistress Quickly. The letter asks Quickly to inform Anne of the nature of Slender's interest in her.
	Analysis
	The first scene sets the first plot, the courting of Anne Page, in motion. It makes clear that the motivation, at least as far as Evans is concerned, is money. This introduces the theme of the play, which contrasts the lure of money, as well as the match-making attempts of parents and others, with true love.
	This scene also highlights the fact that intermediaries (in this case, Shallow and Evans) are employed to set up the match. Using intermediaries to arrange a marriage was a common practice in Elizabethan England. As Ann Jenalie Cook explains in Making a Match: Courtship in Shakespeare and His Society, ""Especially in the upper social echelons families sought assistance in locating suitable marriage prospects. And, when located, a prospect still might require investigation by trusted friends or persuasion by powerful allies. A crucial decision like marriage could not be left to chance"" (p. 104). Shakespeare will have some fun satirizing the practice in this play.
	The first scene also accomplishes some characterization: Slender as an ineffectual yes-man who merely does what he is told; Shallow as a querulous old man who can no longer wield the authority he once enjoyed; Falstaff as something of a villain who is very much in charge of the situation at this point as he mocks Shallow's attempt to remonstrate with him. By showing Falstaff full of confidence, still the lord of his world, Shakespeare sets him up for his fall.

Act I Scene 3
	Falstaff tells the Host that he must get rid of some of his hangers-on, since his expenses are too high. The Host says he will give Bardolph a job as a tapster, serving liquor. Bardolph likes this idea, saying he has wanted such a life. Falstaff is pleased to get rid of him. Falstaff then confides to Pistol and Nym that he has almost run out of money, but he has hatched a scheme that will remedy his fortunes. He plans to seduce Ford's wife, since she has control of her husband's money. He has written her a love letter, and has also written to Mrs. Page with a similar idea in mind. She also controls her husband's money. Falstaff tells Pistol and Nym to deliver the respective letters, promising them that they will all thrive. But Pistol and Nym refuse, and Falstaff cuts them off from his company and gives the letters to Robin to deliver.
	Seeking revenge on Falstaff, Nym says he will inform Page of Falstaff's plan. Pistol says he will inform Ford.
	Analysis
	This scene sets the second plot, the humiliation of Falstaff, in motion. This plot has similarities with the other plot (the courting of Anne Page), since both are concerned with monetary gain for men through alliance with a woman. But whereas the courting of Anne Page (and her inheritance) is a socially acceptable way of advancing one's own financial interests, Falstaff's attempts to accomplish the same goal fall outside the bounds of the moral code that governs the life of the society depicted in the play.
	The Falstaff depicted in this scene, and throughout the Merry Wives of Windsor, is a lesser character than the witty, astute rogue who appears in Henry IV parts 1 and 2. The Falstaff of the Henry plays, for example, would not be foolish enough to think that the two women concerned were giving him ""the leer of invitation."" This Falstaff lacks both the self-knowledge and the shrewd judgment of the earlier comic figure.

	Dr. Caius's servant John Rugby warns Quickly that Caius is on his way home. She shuts Simple in the closet, because she knows Caius will be angry if he finds him in the house.
	Caius enters, speaking almost unintelligible English in a French accent. He summons Rugby and then goes to the closet, where he discovers Simple. He is furious and tells Rugby to fetch his rapier. Quickly tries to calm him down by explaining that Simple came on an errand from Evans. She explains what the errand was, and then tells Simple in an aside that she will do what she can to advance Slender's cause with Anne Page, even though she knows that Caius is also in love with the girl. In the meantime, Caius writes a challenge to Evans (even though Evans was only the bearer of a message) and reproaches Quickly who, he says, promised that he would be able to have Anne. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him.
	After Caius exits, with Rugby in tow, Quickly in a soliloquy says that Caius has no chance with Anne. Quickly claims to knows Anne's mind better than anyone, and also has more influence on her than anyone.
	Fenton enters, inquiring about Anne, whom he wants to marry. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him. Fenton gives Quickly some money, and asks her to put in a good word for him to Anne. Quickly agrees, but after Fenton leaves, she lets on that Anne does not love him.
	Analysis
	Shakespeare's satire of the Elizabethan use of go-betweens in marriage negotiations kicks into high gear in this scene, in the figure of Mistress Quickly. She acts as a kind of universal go-between, promising to help all of Anne's various suitors. In this scene she manages to promise Slender, Caius and Fenton that she is on their side. She claims to know Anne's mind better than anyone. We see no evidence of this in the play, but Quickly seems to have convinced everyone it is true, and she is careful to give all the suitors hope, even if it means telling a few lies. She tells Fenton, for example, that Anne loves him, but as soon as he is gone, she reveals that Anne does not love him. We also see once more how money greases the wheels of love, since Fenton pays Quickly for her service. He gains nothing from this investment, however, since Quickly appears to do nothing at all to advance his cause.

Pistol is explaining to Ford that Falstaff is after his wife. Ford at first has a hard time believing this, since his wife is not young. But Pistol insists that what he says is true, and he also tells Page to believe what Nym is about to tell him.
	After Pistol exits, Ford says he intends to get to the bottom of the matter. Nym then tells Page that Falstaff loves Page's wife. After Nym exits, Page says he does not believe what he has been told, calling Nym a rogue.
	Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page see Quickly coming, and they resolve to use her to convey their message to Falstaff.
	After the women exit, Ford and Page discuss the allegations against Falstaff. Page dismisses them, saying that Falstaff would not do such a thing, and that those who informed on him are former men of his, so probably-he implies-have a grudge against him. He also says that even if Falstaff did have designs on his wife, he is confident that nothing would come of it. Ford is not so sure, however, and says that he would not trust his wife with Falstaff.
	The Host and then Shallow enter. They invite Page to come and watch a duel to be fought between Evans and Caius. Shallow takes Page aside and tells him that the Host has in fact told the duelers to go to different locations. Host speaks privately to Ford, and says he will introduce Ford, under the name of Brook, to Falstaff. After the Host, Shallow and Page exit, Ford speaks of his suspicions of his wife. She and Falstaff were together at Page's house, and he does not know what might have happened there. He resolves to pursue the matter by sounding out Falstaff.
	Analysis
	This scene reveals just how formidable these ""merry wives of Windsor"" are. They are not so much merry as vengeful, and poor Falstaff has no idea of what he has got himself into. In this play, it is the women who are in charge. It is easy to see why, from their forceful reactions to Falstaff's pitiful attempt to seduce them, that they dominate their husbands (remember that they control their husbands' money, which is why Falstaff is pursuing them).
	This scene also continues the comic parallel and contrast between the two different kinds of wooing in the play, one legitimate and moral, the other illegitimate and immoral. This is accomplished by having Mistress Quickly act as a go-between for Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page, just as she does for the suitors of Anne Page.

Act II Scene 2
	Pistol asks Falstaff to lend him money, but Falstaff refuses. He says he has had enough of deflecting the demands of Pistol's creditors and swearing to them that Pistol is a reliable man. He is still annoyed by Pistol's refusal to deliver his letter, and this prompts Pistol to relent.
	Mistress Quickly enters, and informs Falstaff that Mrs. Ford is thrilled by his letter. She thanks him a thousand times for it. She also wants him to know that her husband will be away from his house from ten to eleven. She invites Falstaff to visit. Quickly also informs Falstaff that his letter to Mrs. Page has also been well received. Mrs. Page's husband is seldom out of the house, however, but Mrs. Page hopes there will be a time when he is.
	Quickly then arranges for Falstaff's page, Robin, to be the go-between for him and Mrs. Page.
	Falstaff is delighted with his apparent success, and looks forward to getting some money from the two women.
	Bardolph enters, announcing to Falstaff that a man named Brook wishes to see him. Ford enters, disguised as Brook. Ford asks Falstaff for his help. He says he is in love with Mrs. Ford, and has pursued her in earnest, but she is not the slightest bit interested in him. Ford flatters Falstaff about how accomplished a man he is, and asks him to seduce Ford's wife, since he will be able to do it as easily as any man. Ford also offers him money.
	Falstaff does not understand what Ford's purpose is in asking him to do this. Ford explains that Mrs. Ford prides herself on her honor and her virtue. But if he could show her that he knows she has been having an affair with Falstaff, her defenses against him would no longer have any validity, and he would have a better chance with her.
	Falstaff willingly agrees to the proposition, and accepts Ford's money. He says he will be with Ford's wife between ten and eleven. He also takes the opportunity, in the presence of Brook, to insult and deride Ford as a cuckold (a man whose wife commits adultery) and a rogue.
	After Falstaff leaves, Ford gives vent to his jealousy, thinking he has proof of his wife's infidelity. He vows to prevent it from happening and be revenged on Falstaff.
	Analysis
	In this scene, Quickly does more work as a go-between and is true to her promise to keep the secrets of the merry wives. She also shows that being a matrimonial go-between can be a profitable enterprise. Just as Fenton paid her for her anticipated services in the earlier scene, Falstaff pays her in this one. And then money changes hands again when Ford pays Falstaff. ""If money go before, all ways do lie open,"" says Ford, a saying that certainly applies to the play so far, which has shown a lot of financial transactions and much desire for monetary gain, and very little actual love.
	In his outburst of jealousy, Ford is a comic version of other jealous husbands in Shakespeare's plays, such as Leontes (in The Winter's Tale) and Othello, both of whom suspect their wives without cause.

Act II Scene 3
	- Act III Scene 1
	In a field near Windsor, Dr. Caius is angry that Evans has not shown up for the duel. Page, Shallow, Slender and the Host enter, telling Caius that they have come to see the duel, even though they know that Evans has been directed to another place, the other side of town. Caius claims Evans is a coward. He still wants to kill him.
	The men plan to continue their joke at Caius's expense. They agree to take him to Frogmore, where Evans has been sent. But they tell Caius they are taking him to see Anne Page, and he will have the opportunity to woo her. The Host even promises to be his advocate.
	In the next scene, at a field near Frogmore, Evans awaits Caius for the duel and sends Simple out to look for him. After Simple exits, Evans reveals that secretly he is relieved Caius has not shown up.
	Page, Shallow and Slender enter. Pretending that they do not know what the situation is, they tell Evans that Caius is nearby, and is very upset at being wronged. In a show of bravado, Evans denounces him as a cowardly knave.
	The Host, Caius and Rugby enter. Evans and Caius offer to fight, but Evans also takes Caius aside and offers him friendship, while saying aloud for the benefit of the others that he will beat Caius up for reneging on his appointment. Caius makes some aggressive remarks, but the Host calms the situation down and confesses that he deliberately directed them to different places because he did not want to lose either his doctor (Caius) or his priest (Evans). He asks them to put away their swords and be reconciled. After the Host exits, Caius and Evans agree to be revenged on him for his deceit. Caius is angry because he was told that he would be meeting Anne Page there.
	Analysis
	These short scenes are mostly a diversion from the main plots. Both are examples of dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience, or the other characters, know something about the situation that one or more characters do not. In Act 2, scene 2, for example, all but Caius know that Evans has been deliberately directed by the Host to another part of town, so the duel will not take place. (This information is conveyed in Act 2, scene 1.) The humor of the scene consists in the mocking of the pompous and hot-tempered Caius, and his exclamations in terrible English, just as the humor of Act 3, scene 1 is at the expense of Evans, the other would-be duelist. The humor lies in the contrast between Evans's fighting words and his real, less courageous sentiments.

Act III Scene 2
	Ford encounters Mrs. Page with Falstaff's page, Robin, which leads Ford to jump to conclusions and mock the absent Page for his stupidity in not suspecting his wife. He vows that he will torture his wife, expose Mrs. Page and show what a fool Page is. He resolves to go to his own house when he knows Falstaff will be there with his wife.
	Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Evans and Caius enter. They are on their way to dine with Anne Page. Shallow and Slender hope to have an answer that day as to whether Slender will be able to marry Anne. Page supports his suit, but Mrs. Page prefers Caius. Host mentions Fenton, but Page says that Fenton is from too high a social class to be suitable for his daughter.
	Ford invites them all to his house to witness a monster (that is, Falstaff).
	Analysis
	Caius's remark to Page that Mistress Quickly has told him that Anne loves him shows that Quickly has been working behind the scenes to encourage her clients, even if that means completely disregarding the truth.
	Page's complete rejection of Fenton, in spite of the Host's extravagant praise of the young man, comes down, as does so much in this play, to a matter of money. Page says Fenton is too worldly wise and keeps company with a higher level of society than would be suitable for the middle-class Anne, but this is really only a smokescreen. His real complaint seems to be that Fenton, although of a higher social class, has no money, and Page is determined that Fenton is not going to repair his fortune's at Page's expense: ""no, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance."" Money rules!

Act III Scene 3
	At Ford's house, Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page rehearse their plot to dump Falstaff in a dirty laundry basket and empty it in a muddy ditch on the banks of the River Thames.
	Falstaff enters and declares his love for Mrs. Ford. Mrs. Ford goes along with him, replying that she loves him too. But then, as rehearsed, Robin enters, saying that Mrs. Page has arrived in a state of some excitement, and must see Mrs. Ford immediately. Falstaff, not wanting Mrs. Page to find him there, hides behind an arras (a tapestry wall-hanging).
	Mrs. Page rushes in and says that Ford is coming to the house, with a crowd of officials, to look for a man who is taking advantage of Mrs. Ford in her husband's absence. Mrs. Page urges her friend to get rid of the man, if he is indeed there. She suggests putting him in the laundry basket. Mrs. Ford says he is too big for it, but then the terrified Falstaff, who has overheard all of this-as he was meant to-emerges from his hiding place and says he can fit in the basket. Mrs. Page professes surprise to see him there, and asks him if the letters are his. He has time only to say that he loves her before he gets into the basket. Mrs. Ford summons her servants to take the basket away.
	Ford, Page, Caius and Evans enter as the servants exit. Ford locks the door of the house. He goes to search the house, and the other men follow him.
	Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford enjoy their joke and plan more tricks against Falstaff. They agree to send Mistress Quickly to him to excuse the incident and give him fresh hope. Then they will lead him on to another punishment.
	Ford and the others return. Since they have found no one, Ford is forced to admit that he was in the wrong, and he asks his wife to forgive him.
	Analysis
	This amusing central scene constitutes the first of Falstaff's three humiliations. The humor is the physical humor of farce, rather than the intellectual humor that characterizes Falstaff's scenes in the Henry IV plays. For those who are reading the play rather than watching a performance of it, it is essential to try and stage this scene in the mind's eye in order to appreciate it.

27,Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary: Act III Scene 4,"
	 
Act III Scene 4
	Fenton tells Anne Page that he is discouraged in his attempt to win her hand, because her father is refusing to support him. He says that at first he courted Anne because her father was wealthy, but he has since come to see that she is worth more than any amount of gold. Anne tells him not to give up, but to continue to seek her father's favor.
	Shallow, Slender and Mistress Quickly enter. They have brought the painfully shy Slender to talk to Anne. He is scared of approaching her, and when he and Shallow do approach, he lets Shallow do all the talking, merely echoing what Shallow says. Anne finally asks Shallow to let Slender woo her by himself. Slender does not do much to advance his cause. He tells Anne that he is wooing her only because her father and his uncle put his name forward. He does not seem to care much whether he marries Anne or not.
	Page enters with his wife, and urges Anne to love Slender. He is annoyed to see Fenton there as well, and reiterates that he will not give Fenton permission to marry his daughter.
	After Page, Shallow and Slender have gone, Fenton presses his claims with Mrs. Page, saying that he loves Anne. Anne pleads that she does not want to marry Slender, whom she thinks is a fool. Nor does she want to marry Caius, whose suit Mrs. Page appears to be considering. After her daughter's protests, Mrs. Page softens her tone, and tells Fenton she will talk to Anne and find out how she feels about him.
	Left alone with Fenton, Quickly tells him that is it because of her that he now appears to have a chance with Anne. After Fenton exits, Quickly says that she will in fact continue to act as advocate for Caius and Slender, but also, and specially, for Fenton.
	Analysis
	This scene is written partially in verse, the first scene in the play to use verse. Appropriately enough, the blank verse lines are given to Fenton, the gentleman, who explains to Anne that although he pursued her at first for her money, he now loves her for herself. This is the first counterweight to the predominant theme of money as the main motivating factor in prospective marriages. Here it is love that is important, not money, and Fenton and Anne have to figure out a way of enabling love to triumph. The scene with Fenton and Anne is immediately contrasted with the ludicrous attempt of Shallow to get Slender to make an impression on Anne, which he totally fails to do. The message is clear: real love is superior to attempts made by advocates and go-betweens to secure a marriage based on expediency rather than love.
	Mistress Quickly is still getting up to her tricks and profiting by them. She convinces Fenton that the softening of Anne's mother towards him is her own doing, and then accepts another payment from him. For Quickly, match-making continues to be a profitable business!

Act III Scene 5
	Falstaff tells Bardolph to get him some wine and a piece of toast. He speaks with disgust of his ordeal in being tossed into the river. Quickly enters, and Falstaff responds coldly to her. Quickly then explains that Mrs. Ford has told her that the men made a mistake in throwing the basket into the river. It was not her fault, and she is upset about it. She sends word that her husband will be out hunting birds from eight to nine, and she desires to see Falstaff again. Falstaff agrees to try again.
	Ford enters, disguised again as Brook. He inquires about what happened between Falstaff and Mrs. Page. Falstaff tells him the entire truth, including another long speech about the discomfort and indignity he suffered in the basket. Ford assumes that Falstaff will no longer be pursuing Mrs. Ford, but Falstaff tells him of the new plan. It is past eight o'clock so he is ready to depart. He promises Brook again that he, Brook, will enjoy Ford's wife.
	After Falstaff exits, Ford is once more beside himself with jealousy and vows that Falstaff will not escape this time.
	Analysis
	In his soliloquy at the beginning of the scene, in which he laments his ducking in the Thames, Falstaff shows some of the wit and verbal exuberance that mark his character in the Henry IV plays. If earlier in the play, he has been something of a villain, threatening to disrupt the harmony of the community, here he appears more as victim than villain. These opposite perspectives on his character and his role in the play will continue until the end.
	However, for all the wit Falstaff shows in verbalizing about his humiliation, he is still easily taken in by the merry wives' next scheme. In this respect he appears as little more than a stage buffoon rather than one of the great comic characters in English drama. Those who love Falstaff from the Henry plays are often distressed by his reduction in stature (although not in physical bulk) here.

29,Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary: Act IV Scene 1-2,"
	 
Act IV
	Scene 1-2
	Scene 1 is a short scene which is a digression from the main plot. Evans tries to instruct Mrs. Page's son William in Latin grammar.
	In scene 2, Falstaff speaks to Mrs. Ford in Ford's house. But he has only just begun his latest attempt at seduction before Mrs. Page rushes in. Falstaff hides in another room. Mrs. Page announces that Ford, in another wild fit of jealousy, is on his way over to the house, with a group of friends. Falstaff refuses to go in the basket again, but he cannot leave the house, which is already guarded by three of Ford's brothers. Mrs. Page has the idea of disguising Falstaff, and then he can leave. Mrs. Ford says that her maid's aunt, known as the fat woman of Brainford has a gown upstairs. Falstaff exits to put on the gown, as well as her hat and muffler.
	Mrs. Ford wishes that her husband might find Falstaff in this disguise, since he hates the fat woman of Brainford and has threatened to beat her. Once again, the women are pleased with the success of their joke.
	Mrs. Ford arranges for the servants to be carrying the linen basket when her husband arrives. Sure enough, when Ford arrives, he demands to see what is in the basket, and pulls the clothes out himself. Of course, there is no one in the basket, and Evans, Shallow and Page reproach him, believing him to be mistaken in his jealousy. Ford persuades them to join him in a search of the house.
	Falstaff enters, disguised, with Mrs. Page. Ford is outraged, because he has forbidden the fat woman of Brainford to enter his house. He attacks Falstaff and beats him as he runs away.
	When the men exit, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford express their satisfaction at the beating Falstaff received. They plan to tell their husbands everything, and relish the prospect of Falstaff's public shaming. They also say they will be prepared to teach Falstaff another lesson, if their husbands desire it.
	Analysis
	Once more Falstaff attempts to seduce Mrs. Ford with ridiculously inflated language (scene 2, lines 1-6). But after that the humor, as with the laundry basket scene, is all physical-Falstaff's disguise, the beating he gets from Ford. There is no subtlety about it. There is also, as some commentators have remarked, some repetitiveness about the plotting. At the close of Act 3, Falstaff divulged his plans once again to the disguised Ford, just as he had done in Act 2, scene 2. And in this scene, the jealous Ford once again rushes to his house and searches for the malefactor. The difference of course is that this time he is successful, even though he does not realize that the intruder is Falstaff. Falstaff's punishment is also more severe in this scene than in the earlier one, since being beaten is surely worse than getting drenched in a dirty laundry basket.

Act IV
	Scene 3-4
	In scene 3, Bardolph tells the Host that the Germans who have been staying at the Garter Inn need to have three of his horses, to meet the Duke at court. The Host agrees, but says he will make them pay for the horses.
	In scene 4, Ford, who has been shown the letters Falstaff wrote and how the women responded to them, asks forgiveness of his wife.
	Then Page, Ford, their wives, and Evans plan yet another trick on Falstaff. The women will ask him to meet them in the wood at night, disguised as Herne the Hunter, the spirit of a man who used to be a keeper in the forest. Herne is said to appear with great horns and cause mischief in the wood. When Falstaff comes and meets the women, Anne Page and a few more children will pretend to be fairies and rush at him. The women will run away, and the children will encircle him and pinch him and ask him why he dares to tread on their sacred paths.
	Mrs. Ford suggests that the fairies will continue to pinch him and burn him with tapers until he admits the truth. Then everyone else will appear and mock Falstaff all the way back to Windsor.
	Page plots to allow Slender to marry his daughter immediately after the joke in Windsor forest, while Mrs. Page lays plans to marry Anne off to Caius. She thinks Slender is an idiot, whereas Caius has money, as well as friends at the royal court.
	Analysis
	The horse-stealing described in scene 3 begins a new subplot. Since it emerges so suddenly, is not connected to the main action, and never fully resolves itself, some scholars posit the idea of a ""lost scene"" of the play, in which this sub-plot was resolved. Others have argued that the horse-stealing is a plot hatched by Caius and Evans, who in Act 3, scene I resolve to be revenged on the Host because he has deceived them. But this revenge is never enacted, unless it takes place through this horse-stealing episode.
	The role of wealth and social position in producing a desirable marriage is again emphasized in scene 4, when Mrs. Page says that her daughter will marry Caius because he has money and favor at court. She is determined to stick to her choice even if twenty thousand worthier men come to court Anne.
",Merry Wives of Windsor

Act IV
	Scene 5-6
	At the Garter Inn, Simple is looking for the fat woman of Brainford. She is also known as a wise woman, and he has a question to ask her from Slender. Simple asks to see Falstaff, because he has caught sight of him still in his disguise and thinks that the woman is in Falstaff's room. After Falstaff tells the Host that she has gone, Simple tells Falstaff that Slender wanted to ask the wise woman whether he would marry Anne Page. (Apparently the old woman has a reputation as a fortune-teller.) Falstaff gives him a ""wise guy"" answer that doesn't tell him anything, and says he heard it from the old woman herself. Satisfied with this, Simple leaves.
	Bardolph enters with news that the Germans have stolen the Host's horses, but the Host is loathe to believe the worst of his guests. That is, until Evans enters with the information that the Germans have tricked all the innkeepers of the nearby towns of their horses and their money. Caius confirms that there is no duke at the court who goes by the name that the Germans have supplied. Distressed, the Host calls for a hue and cry to catch the thieves. He exits with Bardolph.
	Mistress Quickly enters and says she has come from Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford. Falstaff is in no mood to listen to her, and says he has suffered enough. She says that the women have suffered too, especially Mrs. Ford, who has been badly beaten by her husband. Quickly presents Falstaff with a letter (presumably from Mrs. Ford or Mrs. Page), and he invites her into his room.
	In scene 6, Fenton promises to pay the Host even more money than he has lost if he will cooperate with him. Fenton explains that Anne has been told by her father to slip away from the forest in her disguise as the fairy queen, and go to Eton where she will be immediately be married to Slender. Fenton says that Anne has consented to this plan (which obviously is against her wishes). But Mrs. Page, says Fenton, has other plans. She has arranged for Anne to slip away and be married to Caius, to which plan it appears that Anne has also agreed. Page expects his daughter to be dressed in white in the forest, whereas Mrs. Page expects her to be dressed in green. The color of her clothing is important because that is how the would-be grooms will be able to recognize her. Fenton wants the Host to secure the services of a vicar and to wait at the church, where he intends to bring Anne and marry her.
	Analysis
	Act 4, scene 5 concludes the subplot about the horse-stealers. Although it is not really integrated with the main action of the play, it does have some thematic relevance. Virtually everyone in the play tries at some point to deceive someone else, and yet the deceivers eventually discover that they have also been deceived (this will not become fully apparent until the last Act). The deceit of the Host in this subplot contributes to this theme, since earlier he practiced his own form of deceit (on Caius and Evans).
	In scene 6, Fenton's speeches in blank verse are the longest verse passages in the play. They serve to inform the audience of the plots that will create some of the humor in the last act.

Act V
	Scene 1-5
	Falstaff has agreed to go to the wood, hoping this will be third time lucky. Ford, disguised as Brook, enters, and Falstaff tells him to go to the forest at midnight. He tells Brook about his misadventure disguised as the old woman of Brainford, disparages Ford and promises vengeance on him, and promises that Brook will have Ford's wife.
	In scene 2, on the outskirts of Windsor forest, Page, Shallow and Slender rehearse their plans. Shallow tells Slender that he will recognize Anne by her white garments.
	In scene 3, Mrs. Page tells Caius that her daughter will be dressed in green, and that he should slip away with her whenever a moment presents itself. She knows her husband will be angry, but she thinks that is better than the heartbreak that would ensue if Anne is forced to marry Slender.
	Eagerly anticipating yet another humiliation of Falstaff, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford depart for Windsor Park.
	In scene 4, in the park, Evans leads the children disguised as fairies and tells them to remember their parts.
	In scene 5 Falstaff enters, wearing a buck's head, as he has been instructed. It is just after midnight. Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page enter, and Falstaff embraces Mrs. Ford. He is delighted to hear that Mrs. Page is there also. But then there is the sound of horns, and the women run away.
	Evans enters, dressed like a satyr (a mythical creature, half-man, half-beast), with Anne Page and the children, Pistol dressed as a hobgoblin, and Mistress Quickly dressed like the Queen of Fairies. Quickly and Pistol speak some rhymes addressed to the fairies. Falstaff, believing that anyone who speaks to fairies will die, lies face down and closes his eyes.
	Evans and Quickly recite more verses and then command the fairies to dance around the tree, next to which Falstaff lies. Spotting him, Evans commands the fairies to put their tapers to Falstaff's fingers. He gives a start, and the fairies then dance around him, pinch him and recite a scornful rhyme. While this is going on, Caius steals away with a boy in green; Slender with a boy in white (each thinks he has got Anne Page), while Fenton steals away with Anne. After a noise of hunting is made, the fairies run away.
	Page, Ford and their wives disclose themselves to Falstaff and mock him. He realizes that he has been made a fool of, but this does not stop their mockery. Falstaff resigns himself to enduring their insults.
	Page invites Falstaff to his house for dinner, where he will be able to laugh at Mrs. Page (who is now laughing at him), because she will have found out that her daughter has married Slender (or so Page thinks). In an aside, Mrs. Page discloses that Anne has in fact married Caius (or so she thinks).
	Then Slender enters, distressed. He tells how the person he thought was Anne Page turned out to be a boy. Page rebukes him for making a mess of their plan, but Slender explains that he followed it exactly. Mrs. Page tells her husband not to be angry, and explains that she put her daughter in green to foil his plan, and that Anne is now married to Caius.
	Caius enters, and tells a story just like Slender's. He eloped with a boy, thinking it was Anne.
	Fenton and Anne enter. They are married. Fenton rebukes her parents, saying that they wanted her to marry without love. He and Anne are now united and should not be accused of disobedience, since they married for love. Anne therefore avoided a forced, unhappy marriage. Page forgives them, and his wife follows his example. She invites everyone to their home where they can all laugh at what has happened. Falstaff is invited too, and Ford appears to be ready to forgive him his folly.
	Analysis
	In the final scene, the community of Windsor comes together and overcomes the threat embodied in Falstaff by exposing and ridiculing him. In doing so they reaffirm the moral and social order that governs their lives. Mrs. Page gives the moral of the play in Act 5, scene 3: ""Against such lewdsters and their lechery / Those that betray them do no treachery.""
	But anyone who knows the Henry IV plays will be disappointed to see the great wit and rogue Falstaff laid low in this manner. His abject submission, ""Use me as you will,"" and his comment, ""I am not able to answer,"" could not possibly have been uttered by the Falstaff of the Henry plays, who is never at a loss for words and can talk himself out of any situation.
	If Falstaff is thoroughly humiliated, the other characters do not emerge unscathed either. In the marriage plot concerning Anne Page, the deceivers are themselves deceived, and their materialistic values rebuked. The young lovers, Fenton and Anne, overcome the cold practicalities of middle age. Fenton is like Falstaff in the sense that he too transgressed the social order, since he had no permission to marry Anne, but he asks for and receives forgiveness.

33,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"Act 1 Scene 1

Summary
	The play is set in a city called Ephesus. Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse who has been sentenced to death, is pleading for mercy from Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus. The Duke protests that he cannot act in defiance of the law. He explains that there has been a disagreement between the cities of Syracuse and Ephesus and that if any merchant from either city is found in the other, he must pay a fine of a thousand marks or be executed. Egeon does not have the money and says he is resigned to die, as this will end his ""woes."" The Duke, his curiosity awakened, asks Egeon why he came to Ephesus. Egeon tells the story of his life.
	Egeon says he was born in Syracuse and married. He grew wealthy by trading with the city of Epidamnum. His agent in Epidamnum died, leaving his affairs in disarray. Egeon was forced to travel there to sort things out. His pregnant wife followed him. While staying in an inn in Epidamnum, she gave birth to twin boys. At the same time, and in the same inn, a poor woman also gave birth to twin boys. Egeon bought her boys to bring up as servants to his sons.
	While they were returning to Syracuse, a storm blew up. The sailors took a boat and abandoned ship, leaving Egeon and his family to their fate. Egeon's wife tied herself with one son and one of the servants to a mast to prevent them being swept into the sea. Egeon tied himself, with the other son and the other servant, to another mast. The weather grew calmer and they saw two ships, one from Corinth and the other from Epidaurus, sailing towards them. But before the ships reached them, their own ship hit a rock and split in two. Egeon's wife and one son and servant were picked up by the ship from Corinth. Egeon and the other son and servant were picked up by the Epidaurian ship, but they were unable to catch up with his wife's ship and the family was separated.

In Shakespeare's day, as today, the intense bond that often exists between twins was recognized.

Summary
	The play is set in a city called Ephesus. Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse who has been sentenced to death, is pleading for mercy from Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus. The Duke protests that he cannot act in defiance of the law. He explains that there has been a disagreement between the cities of Syracuse and Ephesus and that if any merchant from either city is found in the other, he must pay a fine of a thousand marks or be executed. Egeon does not have the money and says he is resigned to die, as this will end his ""woes."" The Duke, his curiosity awakened, asks Egeon why he came to Ephesus. Egeon tells the story of his life.
	Egeon says he was born in Syracuse and married. He grew wealthy by trading with the city of Epidamnum. His agent in Epidamnum died, leaving his affairs in disarray. Egeon was forced to travel there to sort things out. His pregnant wife followed him. While staying in an inn in Epidamnum, she gave birth to twin boys. At the same time, and in the same inn, a poor woman also gave birth to twin boys. Egeon bought her boys to bring up as servants to his sons.
	While they were returning to Syracuse, a storm blew up. The sailors took a boat and abandoned ship, leaving Egeon and his family to their fate. Egeon's wife tied herself with one son and one of the servants to a mast to prevent them being swept into the sea. Egeon tied himself, with the other son and the other servant, to another mast. The weather grew calmer and they saw two ships, one from Corinth and the other from Epidaurus, sailing towards them. But before the ships reached them, their own ship hit a rock and split in two. Egeon's wife and one son and servant were picked up by the ship from Corinth. Egeon and the other son and servant were picked up by the Epidaurian ship, but they were unable to catch up with his wife's ship and the family was separated.
	When Egeon's son, the youngest of the twins, reached eighteen, he became curious about his brother, whose name, Antipholus, he had adopted. Antipholus of Syracuse (as he is called to distinguish him from his brother Antipholus of Ephesus), left home with his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, who had likewise lost his twin brother (Dromio of Ephesus), to seek for the lost half of his family. Egeon soon followed, searching now for both halves of his family. Eventually he reached Ephesus.
	The Duke is moved by Egeon's story. He tells him that though he cannot alter his sentence, he will postpone the execution for one day to give him time to raise the money to buy his freedom. Egeon feels that his case is hopeless but goes off into the city to try to find the money.

35,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Act 1 Scene 2
Summary
	Antipholus of Syracuse enters with his servant, Dromio of Syracuse. They do not know that Antipholus's father Egeon is also in Ephesus. The First Merchant advises Antipholus to say he is from Epidamnum rather than from Syracuse, lest he be arrested. Antipholus S. gives a purse of his money (a thousand gold marks) to Dromio of Syracuse and asks him to take it to the Centaur inn where they are staying, while he explores the city. Left alone, Antipholus S. reflects on his unhappiness at failing to find his mother and brother.
	Dromio of Ephesus enters and mistakes Antipholus S. for his master, Antipholus of Ephesus, a wealthy citizen married to Adriana; Antipholus S. mistakes Dromio E. for his servant, Dromio S. This misunderstanding leads to an argument. Dromio E. chides Antipholus S. for being late home for dinner. Antipholus S. asks Dromio E. where he left the money he gave him (in fact, he gave it to Dromio S.). Dromio E. does not know what he is talking about. Antipholus S. slaps Dromio E., who flees. Left alone, Antipholus S. worries that his servant has stolen his money. This does not surprise him as he believes Ephesus to be full of cheats, witches, and sorcerers. He thinks that perhaps one has bewitched his servant. He goes off to the Centaur inn to look for him.
	Analysis
	This scene continues the theme of buying and selling. The First Merchant turns down Antipholus S.'s invitation to walk round the town with him on the grounds that he is meeting some merchants by whom he hopes to make a profit. In Ephesus, it is implied, money is placed above friendship, and the human is subject to the monetary. Thus, Egeon is forced by a law enacted by quarreling merchants to pay a ransom for his life in spite of the Duke's compassion towards him. This value system, where economics are paramount, gained ground in Shakespeare's time and dominates our social system today. While Shakespeare had too universal an outlook to be a didactic or narrowly 'political' writer, he presents the dominant status of economic values along with an uncompromising view of the human cost.
	The theme of identity is movingly developed in Antipholus S.'s soliloquy (lines 33-40), in which he likens himself to a drop of water that has plunged into the ocean to seek another drop, losing his own identity in the process. In his quest for his twin brother, he has lost his family and his homeland and in this scene loses his money and servant. He finds himself in a strange land which he believes to be full of people who trade in lies and illusion, some of whom have the power to change or deform the bodies of their victims - a direct attack on self-identity. This speech helps establish the setting of Ephesus as one of strangeness and enchantment, in which anything can happen.
	Dromio E.'s mystified responses to the man he believes to be his master also have a disorienting effect, since our identity partly depends on the memory of our personality and interactions as held by ourselves and others. Much modern literature has explored the question of who we are, if suddenly one day, nobody else recognizes or knows us. This is the situation in which the two sets of twins find themselves.
	Identity, or sense of self, is explored in many of Shakespeare's plays. Often, the characters are thrown into a situation that robs them of the external props and appendages by which they define their identity. In King Lear, Lear loses his kingly status and corrupt daughters and followers, and wanders naked on a moor; in As You Like It, Rosalind and Duke Senior are exiled from the court and, no longer able to draw upon the support system that surrounds nobles, must fall back on their own resources. Such periods of deprivation and suffering serve as a school in which the characters discover a new and stronger self-identity that is less dependant on such crutches as worldly status and rank. In The Comedy of Errors, the strange city of Ephesus is the place where the characters lose their identity, only to regain it in the final act.

36,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 1,"Act 2 Scene 1
Summary
	Adriana, Antipholus S.'s wife, is worried that her husband and servant are not back. Luciana, her sister, explains that men are masters of their liberty and can go where they like. She says that a dutiful wife must exercise patience. This annoys Adriana, who does not see why women should have less freedom than men. She says Luciana only talks of patience because she has no experience of marriage.
	Dromio E. enters and reports to Adriana what has passed between him and the man he believed to be his master, including the beating he received. He says he has gone mad and talks only of his gold. Adriana angrily sends him again to fetch her husband, threatening Dromio with another beating should he fail once more to bring him home. Dromio reluctantly leaves to look for his master.
	Adriana bitterly reflects that if her husband has lost interest in her, it is his doing: he has ""wasted"" her beauty and attractiveness. She thinks that he is playing around with another woman and that this explains why he has not come home. She says she wants to die. Luciana believes that she is foolishly jealous.
	Analysis
	The confusion caused by the mistaken identities deepens. Adriana, in her anger and jealousy, has already constructed an imaginary reality in which her husband has deserted her for another woman. Like Egeon, she sees no point in living if she has lost her loved one. This highlights the extent to which people lose their own identity in that of the beloved.
	The scene also illustrates Adriana's character and contrasts it with that of her sister Luciana. Adriana is angry, independent-minded and impatient, but loves her husband with an intensity that quickly transforms into jealousy. Luciana puts the more conventional point of view, that a wife should be dutiful, patient and uncomplaining. That Adriana should put her sister's calm attitude down to inexperience shows her cynical view of men, women and relationships.

37,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 2,"Act 2 Scene 2
Summary
	Antipholus S. enters, having been to the Centaur inn, and reports that Dromio has stored his gold safely there. Dromio S. enters. Antipholus S. teases Dromio about the conversation he had with Dromio E. about the gold and the dinner, which naturally Dromio S. does not remember. Dromio S. believes he is joking, and gets another beating from his angry master. Dromio S. manages to soothe his master into a better humor with a long joke about baldness.
	Adriana and Luciana enter. Adriana is annoyed and upset at Antipholus S.'s failure to recognize her. She accuses him of infidelity and of having betrayed his marriage vows. Antipholus S. protests that he has never seen her before, and Dromio S, confirms that he also does not know her, which makes her even angrier. Though Antipholus S. is still baffled, he decides to go along with ""the offer'd fallacy"" (line 186) and go with Adriana to her home. Dromio wonders if he has been transformed into an ape or a donkey, as this would explain why Adriana knows him but he does not know her.
	Antipholus S. arrives at Antipholus E.'s house with Adriana and goes upstairs with her and Luciana to dine. Dromio is left to guard the gate, with instructions from Adriana to let no one in.
	Analysis
	Adriana's enraged speech to Antipholus S., whom she believes to be her adulterous husband (she is mistaken on both counts) takes up the image of the drop of water introduced by Antipholus S. in Act 1, scene 2. She says that husband and wife are as indivisible, just as a drop of water placed into the ocean cannot be retrieved. Her idea of love is not only possessive in the extreme but demands the complete obliteration of all individual identity - a notion that proves as unsustainable in the play as it does in real life. She takes this idea to its logical conclusion, saying that ""if we two be one, and thou play false, / I do digest the poison of thy flesh, / Being strumpeted by thy contagion"" (lines 142-144). In other words, she feels she is as responsible as he is for any sin that he commits.
	The characters' confusion of identity is highlighted by Dromio S.'s jesting query as to whether he has been changed into an ape or an ass. Since both animals carried connotations of foolishness, he is in fact asking if he, and by extension his master, are being made fools of. Antipholus S.'s bewildered question, ""Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? / Sleeping or waking, mad or well advis'd?"" (lines 212-213) sums up the absence of constant reference points and solid assumptions in this shifting world.
	Antipholus S.'s essential good humor is apparent in this scene. Dromio S. is able to laugh him out of his determination to beat him, and Antipholus cheerfully decides to go along with Adriana's ""offer'd fallacy"" even though he has never seen her before. This shows that he is open to new experiences, an important quality in a comic hero.

38,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"Act 3 Scene 1
Summary
	Antipholus of Ephesus enters with his servant, Dromio of Ephesus, the goldsmith Angelo and the merchant Balthasar. Antipholus E. asks Angelo to help him placate his wife by telling her that he was delayed at Angelo's shop to oversee the making of the gold chain he intends to give her as a present. He mocks Dromio E. for claiming that he was beaten by his master for misappropriating the thousand marks, saying he must have been drunk.
	Antipholus E. arrives at his house with Dromio E., Angelo and Balthasar. All are expecting dinner, and are unaware that inside the house, dinner is already being eaten by the other Antipholus. They are barred from entering by Dromio S., who is under orders to let no one in. Antipholus E. angrily demands to be let in, but Adriana and the maid Luce (also called Nell - a mistake by Shakespeare) refuse; as far as they are concerned, the master is dining at home and those outside the door are imposters and pranksters. Antipholus E. wants to break down the door, but Balthasar advises him against it, lest it cause a scandal and stain Adriana's reputation. Antipholus E. backs down and suggests that they all dine with a woman friend of his, referred to in the play as the Courtesan (prostitute). She is the hostess of the Porpentine (Porcupine) inn. Antipholous E.'s friendship with her has often caused jealous rages in Adriana. He asks Angelo to bring the chain intended for Adriana to him at the Porpentine inn, so that he can give it to the Courtesan to spite his wife.
	Analysis
	This is our first sight of Antipholus E. and it is hard to judge him as sympathically as we do his twin. Unlike his brother, he cannot be laughed out of a rage by his servant; and his action in giving a chain meant for his wife to the Courtesan is spiteful and petty. However, in his justification, he seems to think that he is shut out of his house because his wife is engaged in some sexual liaison, so he is punishing her supposed infidelity with an adventure of his own.
	Whether Adriana is offering Antipholus S. more than just dinner has been debated by critics. On one hand, her insistence that no one be allowed to disturb them suggests a sexual motive. On the other hand, in the very next scene we see Antipholus S. pursuing Adriana's sister Luciana, which suggests that his attentions were never directed towards Adriana. Indeed, in Act 3, scene 2, he declares that his ""soul"" ""abhor[s]"" Adriana.
	The themes of debt, and buying and selling are explored here in Antipholus E.'s attempt to 'buy off' his wife, who is angry at his absences, with the gold chain he has ordered for her. The gold chain becomes a way of paying off a marital debt he has incurred by his neglect of his wife. When he believes that she has been unfaithful to him, he decides that he this frees him of the obligation: he determines to give the chain to the Courtesan instead. As we see later, the chain is not offered to the Courtesan without obligation, either. Antipholus E. receives a ring from the Courtesan in exchange for the chain. Thus relationships in Ephesus are defined by a chain of debts.

Summary
	Luciana is chiding Antipholus S., whom she believes to be her sister's husband, for wooing her. If he must be unfaithful to Adriana, she says, he should at least pretend he still loves her, be discreet about his affairs, and avoid hurting her. Antipholus S. denies that he is Adriana's husband and declares his interest in Luciana. Luciana runs off in distress to find her sister.
	Dromio S. enters, running away from the kitchen maid, Nell (also called Luce - a mistake by Shakespeare), who is romantically involved with Dromio E. and has mistaken Dromio S. for her husband. He gives his master an unflattering description of her as a fat and sweaty woman, and they laugh together at her expense. Nell was able to describe certain concealed distinguishing marks on Dromio S.'s body, which makes him think she is a witch (he must have the same marks as his twin).
	Antipholus S., unnerved by the fact that everyone in Ephesus appears to know them but that they know no one, concludes that the place is full of witches. He therefore means to leave before nightfall, and asks Dromio S. to go to the harbor to see whether there is a suitable boat for them to take. He confirms that he is repulsed by Adriana, who believes him to be her husband, but attracted to Luciana. However, he trusts nothing and nobody here, so he is resolved to leave her.
	Angelo brings the chain to Antipholus S., believing him to be Antipholus E. Antipholus S. is baffled, saying he never ordered it. Angelo insists that he did, and says he will come to collect his payment at supper-time. Antipholus S. is pleased with his gift and again voices his intention to leave as soon as possible.
	Analysis
	Luciana makes her second speech about right and wrong behavior in marriage. She assumes that men will have affairs but believes that they should behave discreetly and tactfully, pretending to love their wives. This has an ironic undercurrent of self-sabotage, since we know that Antipholus is wooing her for herself, and before they have even started their relationship, she is giving him license to stray.
	Dromio S.'s panic-stricken question to his master, ""Am I your man? Am I myself?"" and his own reply, ""I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and beside myself"" (lines 74-76) highlight the theme of identity in relation to others. Dromio S. has suddenly become the property of a woman he does not know, and this makes him wonder whether he is still himself or has mysteriously been transformed. His comic horror-struck bafflement contrasts with Antipholus S.'s romantic invitation to Luciana to ""create [him] new"" and ""transform"" him through love (lines 39-40). His promised submission to her (""teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak - line 33)"" reverses Luciana's notions of how a dutiful wife should act. Antipholus S. has failed to complete his identity by finding his brother, but he is asking Luciana to create an identity for him.
	Antipholus S. benefits from the mistaken identities, as he gains a wife (albeit one he does not want), a potential lover in Luciana, and now, a gold chain. Antipholus E., on the other hand, loses his wife, access to his home, and the chain. This may explain why Antipholus S. is better-tempered, but it could equally be argued that Antipholus S.'s freer spirit makes him more open to new experiences and nature's bounty.

Summary
	Angelo is in debt to the Second Merchant, who demanding repayment on pain of arrest. Angelo says that Antipholus E. owes him the same sum of money for the chain (which by mistake has been given to Antipholus S.), and at five o'clock he is due to pay him. If the Merchant will accompany him to Antipholus's house, he will be satisfied.
	Antipholus E., who has been at the Porpentine inn, enters and sends Dromio E. to buy a rope's end, with which he plans to beat his wife and her household for locking him out of his house. Angelo asks Antipholus E. to pay him for his gold chain, so that he can pay the Merchant. But Antipholus never received the chain, and so will not pay. Antipholus E. suggests that Angelo take the chain and the Merchant to his house, where Adriana will pay him on receipt of the chain. Angelo points out that Antipholus E. has the chain, which Antipholus denies, so Angelo has him arrested.
	Dromio S. arrives from the harbor and mistakes Antipholus E. for his master. He tells him he has put their belongings on board a ship bound for Epidamnum. As soon as Antipholus and the ship's owner are on board, the ship will sail. Antipholus E. angrily silences the man he believes to be his servant, since he sent him to get a rope's end. He orders Dromio S. to fetch money from Adriana to pay his way out of jail.
	Analysis
	This scene serves to move the plot complications forward. Antipholus E.'s fortunes continue to decline as a result of the misunderstandings: now, he loses his freedom through being arrested for debt.
	The theme of monetary debt taking precedence over all other considerations of relationship is taken up in Angelo's move to arrest Antipholus E. Only a short time ago, Angelo was to be Antipholus E.'s dinner guest, but the perceived bad debt changed everything.

	Adriana, dubbed a mere 'shrew' by some critics in the past, shows herself to be a more complex character. She is able to curse her husband bitterly but then admit to still loving him almost in the same breath - and sends the money he asks for without a second thought.

Summary
	Antipholus S. muses on the strangeness of the fact that everyone in Ephesus seems to know him: they thank him for favors, show him silk he has ordered, and so forth. Dromio S. arrives with the gold that Adriana has sent to save her husband from prison. Antipholus S. does not understand why Dromio S. has brought him money, since it is the other Antipholus who has been arrested. He asks Dromio S. whether any ships are sailing tonight. Dromio S. replies that he already told him that a ship is leaving soon, and again tries to give his master the money he was ordered to bring. Antipholus S. thinks his servant has been driven mad by the strange atmosphere of Ephesus.
	The Courtesan enters and asks Antipholus S. for the chain he promised her, not realizing that it is the other Antipholus who made this promise. Antipholus S. thinks she is either the devil or a witch and orders her to leave. She asks him for the ring he (actually Antipholus E.) borrowed from her at dinner. Antipholus S., who is afraid of her supernatural powers, flees. Left alone, the Courtesan reflects that he is mad. She says that he has promised her the gold chain in exchange for her ring, but now he will give her neither. Also, he told her at dinner that Adriana had locked him out of his house, and concludes that she did this because he is a lunatic. The Courtesan now intends to complain to Adriana that Antipholus has stolen her ring in a fit of madness, and demand repayment.
	Analysis
	Antipholus S. is increasingly frightened by what he believes to be the culture of witchcraft and sorcery in Ephesus, to such an extent that he only wishes to leave. He is beginning to doubt his own, as well as his servant's, sanity (""The fellow is distract, and so am I, / And here we wander in illusions - /Some blessed power deliver us from hence!"" - lines 40-42). Indeed, his rather hysterical reaction to the Courtesan, branding her a witch or a devil in spite of her reasonable demeanor, suggests that he is close to the brink of losing his reason.

Summary
	Antipholus E. is still awaiting the money from Adriana which will buy him out of jail. Dromio E. enters, bringing the rope's end that his master had earlier asked for. He knows nothing about any money. Antipholus E. is furious and beats him. Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan enter, bringing Dr Pinch, a schoolmaster who has the reputation of a conjurer. Adriana has engaged Pinch to restore her husband (whom she believes to be mad) to his senses, presumably by exorcism. However, when Pinch tries to feel Antipholus E.'s pulse to diagnose his disease, Antipholus E. hits him. Pinch begins to try to conjure the devils out of Antipholus E, who silences him.
	Antipholus E. contemptuously addresses his wife as if she were a prostitute, asking if those with her are her ""customers"". He asks whether the Courtesan dined at his house today. She replies that he himself dined at home, not knowing that this was the other Antipholus. Antipholus protests that he was locked out of his house, which Dromio E. confirms. Pinch concludes that both Antipholus E. and Dromio E. are mad, and that they must be tied up and laid in a dark room. Antipholus moves as if to attack Adriana (though not stated in the stage directions, this can be inferred from the reaction of the others), accusing her of conspiring with her companions to humiliate him. Frightened, she asks for him to be tied up. As Pinch's assistants try to bind him, he struggles, only confirming Pinch's theory that he is possessed by the devil. Adriana promises the Officer that she will pay off his debts. Pinch and his assistants carry off the bound Antipholus E. and Dromio E.
	The Officer tells Adriana that her husband owes Angelo two hundred ducats for the gold chain. The Courtesan testifies that she saw Antipholus with the chain. But Adriana says he never received the chain and that she has not seen it. She asks the Officer to take her to Angelo so that she can ascertain the truth.
	Antipholus S. and Dromio S. enter, frightened and with swords drawn. Luciana and Adriana think that they are Antipholus E. and Dromio E., escaped from capture, and they flee with the Officer. Antipholus S. tells Dromio S. that even witches are afraid of swords, and orders him to load their belongings on board ship so that they can leave.
	Analysis
	Antipholus E. angrily asks his wife whether the Courtesan dined at his house today, and accuses her of being as much of a strumpet as the Courtesan. The irony is that Adriana was innocently entertaining his twin brother, whereas he was not-so-innocently dining with the Courtesan.
	He loses our sympathy further in his violent attack on his wife. Though he is not mad for the reasons Adriana and Pinch believe, he has succumbed to a more dangerous form of madness - unwarranted jealousy.
	The foolishness of Antipholus S.'s fear of magic, witches and sorcerers is demonstrated in the ludicrous character of Pinch, who is both a schoolmaster and a hobbyist conjurer. Pinch's incantations are absurd rather than sinister.
	As we shall see again in the next act, in the character of the Abbess, Shakespeare mistrusted those who set themselves up to diagnose and 'cure' others, including quacks, mountebanks, purveyors of trite wisdom (such as Polonius in Hamlet), and physicians, and often satirized them. In particular, Thus Antipholus E.'s struggling against being bound confirms Pinch's ridiculous diagnosis of possession by the devil, yet if he did not struggle, he would still be bound. There is a strong sense that one cannot win against such self-appointed authorities, since everything one says is taken as confirmation of their prejudices.

The Second Merchant asks about his reputation, and Angelo says that Antipholus E. is well-loved and respected. At that moment, Antipholus S. and Dromio S. enter; Antipholus is wearing the gold chain around his neck. Angelo angrily tells Antipholus S. that he has wronged both him and the Second Merchant by denying that he received the chain. Antipholus S. protests that he never denied having it, and the quarrel escalates until they draw swords upon each other.
	Adriana, Luciana and the Courtesan enter. Adriana begs Angelo and the Second Merchant not to hurt her husband, who should be excused because he is mad. She orders the men to disarm Antipholus S. and Dromio S, but they escape into a nearby priory. The Abbess comes out to find out what is happening. Adriana explains that her husband is mad and asks permission to go into the priory and fetch him. The Abbess asks if the cause was grief, or a sudden loss of wealth in a shipwreck, or perhaps an illicit love affair. Adriana admits that it might be a love affair. The Abbess tells her that she should have challenged her husband. When Adriana protests that she did, the Abbess says she did not do so strongly enough. Adriana points out that she nagged him incessantly about it. The Abbess quickly does a U-turn and concludes that it was Adriana's incessant jealous nagging that drove her husband mad. Luciana defends Adriana by saying her rebukes to Antipholus were mild, but the Abbess's words have struck a chord in Adriana, who feels guilty about her treatment of her husband.
	The Abbess refuses to let them enter the priory, and says that she will keep Antipholus at the priory and treat him herself. Adriana protests, saying it is her job to look after her husband, but the Abbess will not give in. She dismisses Adriana and goes back into the priory. Adriana decides to ask Duke Solinus to intervene and restore her husband to her.
	It is five o'clock. Duke Solinus enters with the Headsman, leading in Egeon to be executed. The Duke announces that if anybody should pay Egeon's ransom, he will not be executed. Adriana takes this opportunity to ask the Duke for justice against the Abbess. She tells him how her husband went mad, they tried to restrain him, he fled into the priory, and now the Abbess will not release him. The Duke recalls a promise that he made to Adriana when she married to help Antipholus E. on account of his good service in his wars. He agrees to mediate and sends for the Abbess.
	They are interrupted by a Messenger, who reports that Antipholus E. and Dromio E. have broken free from Pinch's men, tied up Pinch, set fire to his beard and then thrown filthy water on him to put the fire out. The Messenger fears that they will kill Pinch unless someone intervenes. Adriana says he is lying, and points out that her husband and his servant are inside the priory. Then Antipholus E. runs in with his servant and demands that the Duke give him justice against Adriana for locking him out and thereby dishonoring him. Adriana denies the charge, saying that she dined with her husband, and Luciana backs her up. Antipholus E. gives his side of the story, accusing Angelo of wrongly claiming that he received the chain, and telling of his capture by Pinch. He also says that he has never been inside the priory.
	The Duke is mystified, and can only explain the confusion by saying it must be the result of witchcraft. Alternatively, he suggests that perhaps they are all mad. The accusations continue and the Duke finally calls for the Abbess, who he hopes will make all clear.
	Egeon sees Antipholus E. and greets him in the belief that he is Antipholus S., the son he has brought up. He suggests to the Duke that his son will pay his ransom. Antipholus E., of course, says he has never seen Egeon before in his life. Egeon thinks that grief must have so changed his appearance during the seven years of their separation that he is unrecognizable to his son. Antipholus E. says he never saw his father in his life. Egeon then wonders if Antipholus is ashamed to acknowledge him. But the Duke confirms that he has been Antipholus's patron for twenty years and during that time he has never seen Syracuse. He says that Egeon must be growing senile.
	The Abbess enters with Antipholus S. and Dromio S. The other characters are amazed at seeing two Antipholuses and two Dromios. The Abbess greets Egeon. She tells him that she is his wife, Emilia, separated from him by the shipwreck, and that the two Antipholuses are their twin sons. She explains that she, Antipholus E. and Dromio E. were taken up from the wreck by men from Epidamnum. But then, some fishermen from Corinth took Antipholus E. and Dromio E. away from her, leaving her with the men from Epidamnum. She did not see them again until now, and in the meantime became the Abbess of the priory.
	The rest of the confusion is sorted out. Antipholus S. tells Luciana that he means to make good on his loving promises to her. Angelo is paid for his gold chain, the ring is returned to the Courtesan, and Antipholus S. returns Antipholus E.'s purse of gold coins to him. Antipholus E. offers the money to the Duke to pay his father's ransom, but the Duke refuses to accept it, declaring that the old man is pardoned. Then, the Abbess invites the entire company into the Abbey for a celebratory feast. Dromio S. tells his brother that Nell (Dromio E.'s romantic interest) gave him dinner earlier; now, he says, this ""fat friend"" will be his sister, not his wife. The two Dromios are the last to file into the priory, ""hand in hand"", ""like brother and brother"" (lines 425-6).
	Analysis
	In her adroit manipulation of Adriana's account of Antipholus's supposed madness, the Abbess, like Pinch, offers another opportunity for Shakespeare to satirize the quack diagnosis, in which anything that one says is taken in such a way as conveniently to confirm a diagnosis already made, and the purveyors of conventional wisdom who dispense such diagnoses. First, the Abbess suggests that Adriana was not tough enough on her husband's infidelities, and that this caused him to lose his reason, but when Adriana insists that she rebuked him night and day about it, the Abbess quickly changes tack and says that Adriana has obviously driven him mad with her jealous nagging. Anyone who has tried to extricate themselves from blame by someone who has decided that they are guilty in advance of hearing the evidence will sympathize with Adriana. Moreover, the Abbess's explanation is wrong, since Antipholus E. is not mad and his apparently erratic behavior is explained by the presence in Ephesus of the two sets of twins. However, Adriana takes the Abbess's rebuke to heart, which suggests that it rang true and that she will try to be gentler with her husband.
	The theme of sorcery and witchcraft as an explanation for transformation is developed further, in that even the Duke, one of the more reasonable characters, falls victim to fears of the supernatural, saying, ""I think you have all drunk of Circe's cup"" (line 271). Circe was a sorceress in Greek mythology. She appears in Homer's Odyssey, where she turns Odysseus's men temporarily into pigs by giving them wine spiked with a magic potion. Continuing his witchcraft thread, when the two Antipholuses and the two Dromios appear together for the first time, he asks, ""of these, which is the natural man, / And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?"" (lines 333-4). The Duke is referring to the ancient Greek idea of the daemon, or attendant spirit, which was supposed to be allotted to a man at birth, and to accompany him throughout life.
	The transformation theme is given a psychological twist by Egeon, when the man he believes to be the Antipholus he brought up denies knowing him (in fact, this is the other Antipholus). He thinks that his features must have been so changed by grief and time during the seven years of their separation that he is unrecognizable to his son.
	The Abbess acts as a kind of deus ex machina (literally, 'god from the machine,' after the god that traditionally descended onto the stage at the end of a play to resolve all conflicts and give everyone their just deserts). She resolves the confusion that has accumulated throughout the play and that reaches its height in this last act. The Abbess's explanation defuses a tension that has been edging dangerously towards a witch-hunt, with even the Duke making accusations of witchcraft and sorcery. Supposed witches, it should be remembered, were still tortured and burnt in Shakespeare's time.
	The Abbess's story does not bear reasoned scrutiny, as it begs such questions as how she could spend twenty years in Ephesus without being aware that her son, the prominent citizen Antipholus E., was also living there. But this play is a farce, full of unlikely elements, such as the two sets of twins being dressed identically even after their long separation. The comedic tradition of the final triumph of love and forgiveness also demands that the Duke suddenly waives the city law that previously inextricably bound him to fine or execute Egeon.
	A curious feature of the play's finale is the absence of any expression of joy or love on the part of the Antipholuses at their reunion. Antipholus E.'s attention seems to be on his wife (he quickly jumps in with a denial that Antipholus S. is her husband, at line 371), and Antipholus S. thinks only of pursuing his suit to Luciana. It is unlikely that Shakespeare simply forgot, as the two Dromios are given a funny and touching exchange (""Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: / I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth;"" - lines 417-8). It is possible that Antipholus E. is still suspicious of an adulterous liaison between his brother and his wife; much is left open to interpretation. We are left with a final image of brotherly love in the form of the play's clowns, the two Dromios, walking hand-in-hand into the celebration feast.

Summary
	The story begins in the fall of 1897, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. Buck is a large, one-hundred and forty pound dog who lives on a ranch owned by Judge Miller in Santa Clara, California, some forty miles south of San Francisco.
	Buck is four years old and has an enjoyable life. Unlike the other, smaller dogs on the ranch, he is allowed to roam over the entire property. He goes into the swimming tank, hunts with the judge's sons, and escorts the judge's daughters on their morning walks. In the winter he lies at the feet of the judge in front of the fire in the library. He is like a king who lords it over all the other creatures, and is treated with respect by everyone.
	Buck's comfortable life is ended when Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, take him for a walk and sells him to a man who treats him roughly and throws him into the baggage car of a train. Halfway through the night Buck is transferred to a cage-like crate. In the morning, four men come to pick up the crate. They amuse themselves by poking sticks at him. Buck is conveyed to a railway depot, where he is placed in an express car. He stays there for two days and nights, during which he neither eats nor drinks. He is bundled off the train at Seattle, where a man in a red sweater takes charge of him. The man lets Buck out of the cage, and Buck attacks him in fury, but the man brutally beats him into submission with a club. Buck is beaten but his spirit is not broken. In the days that follow, more dogs arrive, and Buck watches as they are beaten in the same fashion. Adapting to his new situation, Buck realizes that the man is the master and must be obeyed.
	Buck is then sold to a man named Perrault, a Canadian government mail-driver, who realizes from Buck's impressive appearance that he is a dog in a thousand. Along with a dog named Curly, they travel north on the deck of the ship, Narwhal. The dogs are turned over to Francois, a swarthy French-Canadian. Buck learns to respect both men, since they are calm and fair. There are two other dogs on the ship, a big dog from Spitzbergen, and a gloomy one named Dave, who just likes to be left alone. The weather gets colder as they head north, and Buck encounters snow for the first time.
	Analysis
	The Call of the Wild can be read simply as an adventure story about a dog, but most commentators see in it something deeper than that. There are many parallels between the world of dogs and the world of humans, so the novel can be read as a kind of human allegory. Buck himself is given emotions such as pride and shame, and an awareness of abstract ideas such as justice.
	In the first chapter Buck takes the first steps to discovering a different kind of law of life than he has known at Judge Miller's ranch. His life there is very orderly and civilized. He is like a ""sated aristocrat""; he is compared to a country gentleman and a lord (since he is lord over all the other animals on the ranch). In this civilized life, wild impulses are tamed. Buck enjoys comfort and privilege. He does not have to fight for anything; all his needs are provided for. He has not had to earn his position; like an aristocrat, he was born to it. But his deeper nature is unknown to him, and this is what he will discover during the course of the novel. It is a painful journey. In chapter 1, for example, he learns for the first time that there can be other relationships between man and dog than the one he has known. The man in the red sweater who clubs him into submission is his introduction to a ruthless world in which the strong rule, and Buck makes his first adaptation to it.

59,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Summary
	Buck's first day on the beach at the port city of Dyea (just across from Skagway, Alaska), is a nightmare. The other dogs are savage and fight. Curly is killed by a pack of dogs after she goes down in a fight. Buck starts to hate Spitz because Spitz laughs at the scene.
	Buck is again shocked when Franeois puts him in harness with the other dogs and puts him to work, pulling a sled. Franeois maintains firm discipline, and Buck learns easily to recognize and obey the commands. Spitz is the team leader.
	Two more dogs arrive, Billie and Joe. Billie is good-natured, but Joe is sour, with a perpetual snarl. Then another dog, Sol-leks, arrives. His name means the Angry One. Spitz, who had bullied the other newcomers, leaves him alone.
	At night, Buck is surprised to find that he is excluded from the warm tent. Outside, it is far too cold to sleep. But he soon learns to dig himself a hole in the snow, and sleeps warm.
	In the morning, three more huskies are added, making nine in all. They take a trail toward the Dyea Canon. The work is hard but Buck does not despise it, and Dave and Sol-leks, who are placed either side of him, are good instructors.
	They travel north across glaciers and snowdrifts and lakes, and late at night pull into camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where there are thousands of men who have come seeking gold.
	The next day they travel forty miles, but in subsequent days, as they break their own trail, they cannot travel as fast. Buck toils in the traces for many long days. He is given a pound and a half of sun-dried salmon every day, but he finds it is not enough, although the other dogs, who weigh less, find it adequate. He learns how to steal bacon from Perrault, because this is necessary in order to survive. In other ways, too, he adapts to his new, ruthless environment. His muscles become hard, and he is impervious to pain. His senses become extremely acute.
	Analysis
	The law of club and fang is Buck's interpretation of the laws that govern the new life he is leading. It is a ruthless, Darwinian world of the survival of the fittest, a total contrast to what he has known in his first four years of his life. There is no room here for kindness and love, or morality. The death of Curly shows him that just as he has learned a new relationship between man and dog, here in the north there is a new relationship between dog and dog. A dog must prevail through ferocity, strength and courage; to show weakness is to be killed. It is notable how quickly he adapts to all the challenges that face him. He has left the civilized world far behind. He is now prepared to steal food for his master, something that would not have occurred to him in his life with Judge Miller.
	A key passage occurs near the end of the chapter. Buck may have had many generations before him of domesticated dogs, but he retains an instinctual memory of the behavior of his ancestors, before they were tamed by man. He learns so quickly because he is able to tap into these primitive instincts. They were always there within him, but the cosseted, lazy life he led on Judge Miller's ranch did not bring them out. Now he is bringing forth the forgotten side of his nature: ""It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.""
	At the level of the human allegory, this suggests that there is a lot more to human life and behavior than what is revealed in civilized society. Men too, in certain conditions, will revert to a more instinctual, primitive level of life, in which the law of the jungle usurps civilized morality.

Summary
	The deadly rivalry between Spitz and Buck grows. One night Buck makes his nest under a sheltering rock, but when Buck returns after eating his food, he finds that Spitz has taken it over. He attacks Spitz, but their fight is interrupted when the camp is invaded by about fifty starving huskies who have scented the camp from an Indian village. They try to steal all the food. Three of them attack Buck, and the other sled dogs are attacked, too. Francois and Perrault drive them off. All the nine team-dogs are injured. They regroup in the forest and return to camp at daybreak.
	They set off again, down the partially frozen Thirty Mile River, covering only thirty miles in six days. The temperature is fifty below zero. Once, the sled falls through the ice on the river, and Buck and Dave are nearly drowned. Another time, Spitz goes through the ice, and only the strength of Buck and the others saves them all. Then the ice breaks and they have to escape by climbing a cliff. That day they cover only a quarter of a mile.
	Weathering all the difficulties, they persevere. Buck's feet are not as tough as those of the other dogs, and get very sore. Francois makes moccasins for him out of the tops of his own moccasins. Later, Buck's feet get harder, and the moccasins are thrown away.
	One morning, Dolly suddenly goes mad, and Francois kills him with an axe. Spitz attacks Buck but is driven off by Francois's whip. From that point on it is a war between Spitz, the lead dog, and Buck, since Spitz feels threatened by Buck. On another occasion, when Spitz is punishing the malingerer Pike, Buck attacks him, but this time it is Buck who is driven off by the whip wielded by Francois.
	They arrive in Dawson, in the Yukon territory. They spend a week there, before making the return trip, with Perrault carrying important dispatches. They cover fifty miles in the first day. But the dog-team is not harmonious, since Buck's rebellion against Spitz has destroyed the solidarity of the team. In a breakdown of discipline, the other dogs also challenge Spitz.
	As the dog-pack chases down a rabbit, with Buck in the lead, Spitz cuts him off and gets to the rabbit first. This initiates a fight between the two dogs. Buck is triumphant, and Spitz is killed.
	Analysis
	This chapter vividly shows the difficulties and the dangers that the travelers encounter, both external and internal. (Madness afflicts one of the dogs.) As the strongest, Buck inevitably triumphs over Spitz. It is his destiny to become the ""dominant primordial beast."" He uses cunning as well as strength, and he is infinitely patient. He knows how to use his wiles to undermine Spitz's authority with the other dogs, and as a result there is general insubordination amongst the dog-team. Buck has left a human community, with tame animals, but has found himself in another, more ruthless kind of animal community in which the pack dominates, and every pack needs a leader.
	In regressing to a more primitive state, and becoming leader of the pack, Buck discovers for the first time a kind of superior joy, greater than anything he could have known on Judge Miller's ranch. He is getting in touch with the energy of life itself as it surges up within him, not tempered by any civilized or moral values, which, from this point of view, dilute rather than enhance life. London makes this clear in eloquent words: ""There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive."" In the harsh conditions that prevail in Alaska, in which Buck must be constantly alert, and is constantly put to the test, he discovers his true nature.

61,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"Summary
	The next morning, as Franeois harnesses the dogs, he tries to install Sol-leks in the lead position. But Buck refuses to accept this. He wants to be the lead dog, and will not settle for anything less. Franeois and Perrault at first try to beat him into obedience, but Buck keeps out of reach. Eventually Buck wins the battle of wills and is installed as the lead dog. He excels in the position, and quickly restores discipline in the team. Two more dogs, Teek and Koona, are acquired, and Buck breaks them in. The weather is comparatively benign and they make good progress, averaging forty miles a day for fourteen days until they reach Skagway.
	Franeois and Perrault are ordered elsewhere by the government, and leave Buck behind. He makes the trip back to Dawson with his team under a new master. They are extremely tired but get only a two-day break before setting off once more. At nights, Buck has visions of life from long ago; he sees a caveman and large beasts of prey. He is fascinated by these visions, which take him further back into primitive times.
	The dogs get more and more weary, and Dave in particular weakens. He is taken out of the traces, but he resents this. He wants to continue to do his job despite the fact that he is too weak to do to. So his driver puts him back in harness, and Dave continues to pull, falling down several times. They reach camp at night, but in the morning Dave is too weak to travel. The dog-sled moves out without him, and the Scotch half-breed who is in charge goes back and shoots Dave in an act of mercy.
	Analysis
	Buck quickly shows that he is a worthy pack leader, since the dog-team makes the run to Skagway in record time. This makes Franeois and Perrault local celebrities, but it is to Buck that they owe their success.
	Franeois and Perrault then depart from Buck's life for good. They were hard men, but they treated Buck fairly, and he respected them. They are both examples of men who adapted well to their harsh, uncivilized environment. Perrault in particular is described in terms that could also be applied to Buck (""Nothing daunted him""). They show that when men, like the dogs, also revert to a more primitive way of life and behavior, it is possible to do so with honor. Buck's next experience with humans, in chapter 5, will show the other side of the coin.
	The significance of the vision of the cave-man is that Buck is tapping into the collective memory of the species, not his own personal memories. It is this that makes him so quick to adapt to primitive ways of life. Something in him remembers the lives of his ancestors, even though at a personal level all he can remember is his luxurious, easy life at Judge Miller's ranch.

Summary
	After reaching Dawson, the team returns to Skagway. The journey takes one month. The dogs are worn out; Buck has lost twenty-five pounds in weight. Within four days, Buck and his mates are sold to Charles, a middle-aged man, and Hal, a man of about nineteen. Traveling with the men is Mercedes, who is Charles's wife and Hal's sister. Buck's new owners are incompetent, and overload the sled. The dogs are unable to move it. Hal calls them lazy and whips them, although Mercedes tries to persuade him not to. An onlooker suggests that Hal help the dogs by freeing the runners of the sled that are frozen to the snow. When this is done, the dogs are able to pull the sled, but it is so badly loaded it overturns. The owners reluctantly cut the load in half, and acquire six more dogs, making a total of fourteen. The newcomers are not much use, however, and nor does Buck have his heart in the work. He knows he cannot depend on his new masters, because they do not know how to do anything. Progress is very slow, and dog food runs short. Half the food goes when only a quarter of the distance has been covered. One of the dogs, Dub, is injured, and Hal shoots him. Six dogs die of starvation. As the going gets tougher, the three travelers fall to quarreling. Mercedes insists on riding on the sled, which adds intolerably to the load pulled by the weak and starving dogs. Hal, Charles and Mercedes are insensitive to the suffering of the animals. But the seven remaining dogs continue to pull the sled, despite their ill-treatment. One day Billie collapses and cannot continue. Hal kills him with an axe. The next day Koona dies, and only five remain.
	It is spring time, but the travelers are in such a desperate situation they do not notice it. The ice on the river is beginning to break up, but they manage to reach the camp of John Thornton at the mouth of White River. Thornton tells them to take no more chances on the melting ice. Hal refuses to take his advice and wants to continue. But he cannot persuade his exhausted dogs to get up, so he whips them until they begin to move. But Buck refuses. Hal beats him with a club, but Buck has made a decision not to get up. Thornton intervenes, striking Hal, and telling Hal he will kill him if he hits the dog again. Hal draws a knife, but Thornton knocks it out of his hand.
	Hal decides to make off without Buck. They pull out from the bank and start off down the river. After a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks up and the men and dogs are all drowned.
	Analysis
	Charles, Hal and Mercedes are the opposite of the grizzled but efficient Fran�ois and Perrault. They cannot adapt to their new, harsh Arctic environment, as is shown when they overload the sled because they want to take all the trappings of their former, more civilized life-canned goods, blankets, dishes-with them. They consistently exercise bad judgment, so it is natural, according to the law of the survival of the fittest, that they should perish.
	In this episode, London contrasts the civilized and primitive worlds, to the advantage of the latter. The ""civilized"" trio from the south are foolish, petty and endlessly quarrelsome. They are unable to learn and refuse to accept good advice. They degenerate into callous, cruel behavior to their dogs. The more their troubles accumulate, the worse they behave to each other and to their dogs. They know nothing of what London describes as ""the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech and kindly.""
	The episode also illustrates Buck's preternatural instincts in refusing to go on the final, fatal trip. He has a wild animal's instinct for danger. However, he is not yet ready to answer fully the call of the wild. In his state of exhaustion and near starvation, he still needs the nurturing care of a human. This he will find in John Thornton, who rescues him.
",The Call of the Wild
63,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 6,"Summary
	Staying with Thornton during the spring, Buck's strength is restored. He plays with Skeet and Nig, Thornton's dogs, and he also loves Thornton, the man who saved his life. He regards Thornton as the ideal master because he looks after his own dogs as if they were his children. Buck adores him, and goes wild with happiness when Thornton touches him or speaks to him. He does not even like to lose sight of Thornton, since he is afraid of losing him.
	In spite of his faithfulness and devotion, however, Buck retains the wildness that has been growing in him since he was first kidnapped. If a strange dog appears, he fights fiercely, and always prevails. He never shows any mercy. He also hears the call of his wild nature, and apart from Thornton, he no longer has any ties to the human world. It is only Thornton that draws him back. No task is too great for Buck to do for his master. He is even prepared to jump over a cliff when Thornton, on a whim, tells him to.
	Later that year, a man named ""Black"" Burton picks a quarrel with Thornton at a bar. Burton hits him, and is immediately attacked by Buck. He barely escapes with his life, and as a result of his defense of his master, Buck gets a reputation through all the camps in Alaska. Later in the year, Buck saves Thornton from drowning in a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty Mile River.
	That winter, Buck's fame spreads even farther throughout Alaska, when he wins a bet that Thornton makes in a bar. The bet is that Buck can start a sled that weighs a thousand pounds. The test takes place in the street outside the bar, and Buck succeeds in his task, breaking the sled out of the ice and pulling it for one hundred yards. This feat of Buck's wins sixteen hundred dollars for his master. A man then offers to buy Buck for twelve hundred dollars, but Thornton is not interested in selling.
	Analysis
	This chapter appears at first to take Buck in a different direction. Up until now, he has been steadily acclimatizing himself to the harsh Arctic environment and reverting to his primitive nature, hearing more and more the call of the wild. Humans mean much less to him than they used to, when he lived on Judge Miller's ranch, and he obeys them only because of the ""law of club,"" that is, the superior power, of man. But now this appears to turn around. With John Thornton, Buck develops a relationship far closer, and more loving, than anything he had known in the civilized world of the Santa Clara Valley. Perhaps the reason London inserted this chapter here is that he wanted to increase the drama of Buck's final rejection of the human world when it takes place in the last chapter. In order to accomplish this, London has to reestablish Buck's links with humans.
	Having said that, it should also be noted that Buck is a completely different dog with Thornton than he was when he was merely Judge Miller's pet, all those years ago. Buck is now a dog who has come in from the wild and chooses for the time being to stay with a human companion, rather than being a pet who has known nothing other than comfort and human kindness. Buck remains tough, merciless, supreme. And Thornton is Buck's last link with the human world. He does not extend his love or his trust to other humans, to whom he is indifferent, even disdainful. He has not returned to the state of innocence he was in at Judge Miller's, when he trustingly allowed Manuel to sell him into slavery. And despite his new attachment to Thornton, the call of the wild gets stronger and stronger within him and the claims of man slip away. For a while he lives as it were in two worlds, but it is only his attachment to Thornton that prevents the wild from claiming him completely.

64,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 7,"Chapter 7
Summary
	The money Buck wins for him enables Thornton to pay off some debts and journey with his partners in search of a fabled lost gold mine that no living man has ever found. They travel east on an unknown trail. Buck enjoys himself like never before. They journey many months but do not find the lost mine. But they do find gold, in a shallow area in a valley, and they collect as much gold dust and nuggets as they can.
	Buck muses by the fire and has more visions of cave men, and he sees himself wandering with the man. He feels the call of the wild, and sometimes pursues it, spending hours in the forest. ""irresistible impulses"" seize him. He hears a wolf howl, and feels an instant kinship with it. When he sees the wolf, the wolf runs, and Buck follows. When Buck corners it, he does not attack, but makes friendly advances. They continue the chase, and finally sniff noses and become friendly. For hours they run together, and Buck knows he is at last answering the call of the wild. But then he remembers Thornton and returns to the camp. For two days he does not leave, but then he hears once more the call of the forest. He starts to wander in the woods, and stays away from the camp for days at a time, hunting and fishing for his food. He exhibits a wild, wolf-like cunning. As a fearsome hunter, he kills a moose by separating it from the herd and remorselessly pursuing and attacking it. He shows great patience and ferocity. It takes him four days to pull the moose down.
	When he returns to Thornton's camp, he finds it has been overrun by Yeehat Indians. The men and dogs are dead, and the Indians are dancing around the wreckage of the lodge. Buck attacks them and kills several of them. The remainder flee in panic, thinking that an evil spirit has come. Buck discovers that Thornton's body is submerged in a pool.
	At night, Buck hears the yelping of the wolves in the forest, and he finds their call more compelling than ever before. With the death of Thornton, the last of his ties to the human world is gone. When Buck encounters the wolf pack, he kills one of them that attacks him. The other wolves attack him, but Buck positions himself well and fights them off. After half an hour, the wolves back off, and one wolf approaches him in a cautious but friendly manner. It is the wolf Buck has met before. They touch noses. One wolf begins to howl, and the others join in, as does Buck. The pack then runs off, and Buck runs with them.
	For years Buck runs in the wild as a wolf. The Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack, and they are afraid of him. They know he continues on occasion to kill human hunters. They will not enter the valley where he lives.
	Analysis
	Buck continues to hear the call of the wild, and hears it more strongly than ever. From the moment he meets the wolf, and makes friends with him, he exists in two worlds and two communities: the human one, and the wolf community that he is discovering in his ""wild brother.""
	Perhaps because London wanted to emphasize the depth of Buck's attachment to Thornton, and distinguish it from the former relationship between Buck and Judge Miller, he gives to Buck a second vision of the cave-man, but this time the cave-man is accompanied by Buck. The tie between man and dog, it is implied, goes back to the dawn of the human race, when man, at the mercy of wild beasts, needed dogs for protection. Thus the relationship between Thornton and Buck is as much a product of primitive roots as civilized ones.
	The death of Thornton severs the last ties Buck has to the human world. He now becomes completely wild, running with the pack and establishing his mastery through strength and cunning. He is the living example of the Darwinian law of the survival of the fittest. But London does not present this as a regression to be regretted. Buck has in fact triumphed. He has discovered for himself the ancient springs of his own nature, and is more fully himself than when he was cozy and enjoying himself on the ranch at Judge Miller's, or lazing around the fire at John Thornton's. He is fulfilling the deepest impulses of his own being, and in doing so he acquires an almost mythic status as the Ghost Dog or Evil Spirit of Indian legend.

65,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 2","
	 
In another public place in Rome, Caesar, accompanied by his followers, encounters a soothsayer, who tells him to beware the ides of March (March 15). Caesar dismisses him as a dreamer. Caesar and his entourage exit, leaving Cassius and Brutus to engage in conversation. Cassius mentions that recently Brutus has not seemed so friendly towards him as he usually is. Brutus replies that it is nothing personal; he is troubled by some private business and this is affecting his behavior towards others. Cassius hints that he knows Brutus better than Brutus himself does. He suggests that others in Rome who are suffering under Caesar's oppression have wished that Brutus would open his eyes to their plight and (Cassius implies) do something about it. He promises to tell Brutus something about himself that he is as yet unaware of.  
	As shouts are heard from the crowd offstage, Brutus says he fears that the people will choose Caesar for their king. Even though he loves Caesar, Brutus does not want him to be crowned king. Cassius then gives a long speech in which he explains that Caesar is not fit to hold the great office that he does. He expresses his frustration at the inferior position he occupies in relation to Caesar, even though he was born just as free as the man who now rules. Cassius relates an incident that showed he was a better swimmer than Caesar. He also observed Caesar when the latter had a fever, and he was not impressed. Caesar trembled and groaned, his eyes looked dull and his voice sounded feeble, like that of a sick girl. And yet this Caesar, who is physically weak, rules over Rome.  
	More shouts are heard from the crowd outside, which Brutus takes to be a sign that new honors are being heaped on Caesar. Cassius continues his complaint against Caesar and bemoans the fact that so much power is concentrated in one man. He castigates Romans for allowing it.  
	Brutus says he will consider Cassius's words, but he does not want to commit himself yet.  
	Caesar and his entourage return. Caesar tells Mark Antony that Cassius is a dangerous man, although he hastens to add that he is not afraid of him, since he fears no one. But men like Cassius, Caesar observes, are never at rest while someone else holds power over them.  
	After Caesar exits, Casca explains to Cassius and Brutus that Antony just offered Caesar a crown three times. Each time Caesar rejected it, but each time he did so with greater reluctance. The crowd cheered when he rejected it for the third time, at which Caesar had an epileptic fit and fell down foaming at the mouth. Just before he collapsed, he theatrically opened his doublet, offering the crowd his throat to cut.  
	Casca also mentions that Flavius and Murellus have been executed for removing crowns from Caesar's statues. Their acts were considered treasonous.  
	After all have left, Cassius is left alone. He reflects that although Brutus is a noble man, it is possible to be lure him away from his natural inclinations and persuade him to join the conspiracy to kill Caesar. Cassius plans to write some letters, in different handwriting, and toss them through Brutus's window that night, as if they came from several different Roman citizens. The letters will confirm how high Brutus is held in public esteem and hint at Caesar's ambition.  
	Analysis
	This long scene introduces Caesar and the conspirators. Caesar is a commanding figure, always giving orders and expecting to be obeyed. He also shows acute psychological insight, since he rightly identifies Cassius as a dangerous man. Caesar is also presented as less than robust physically. Cassius's personal envy of Caesar is revealed, although he never demonstrates how Caesar's physical weakness makes him unsuitable to govern. Cassius's cunning is shown in his subtle attempts to bring Brutus around to his way of thinking. Once he has created an opening, Cassius is resourceful and knows how to reel Brutus into his plot by flattering him.  
	Like the first scene, this scene shows how the common people play a significant role. Politicians try to win them over and are affected by how they react, as is shown in Casca's report of the offering of the crown to Caesar. Caesar is ""playing the crowd,"" affecting not to want what he really covets. Shakespeare does not show this action directly, informing the audience only through Casca's telling of it, because he wants to reserve such a scene for the climactic Act 3 scene 2, in which Brutus and then Antony address the citizenry directly.  ",Julius Caesar
66,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 3","
	 
That night there is a fearsome thunderstorm. Meeting Cicero in a Roman street, Casca tells of strange things he has seen and heard about that night. Women swear they saw a hundred men, covered in fire, walking up and down the streets; he himself saw a lion at the capital and a man with his hand on fire that flamed like twenty torches without burning him. These strange events mean that something ominous is about to take place.  
	Cassius enters. He has been wandering the streets during the storm. He tells Casca that the unnatural disturbances are a warning that something is badly wrong with Roman society. He says that he could name a man who is every bit as ominous as the signs in the stormy night. Casca knows that he refers to Caesar, and Cassius says that Romans are feeble because they put up with his tyranny.  
	Casca believes that the following day, the Roman Senate will offer Caesar a crown. Cassius boasts that he has the power, and will use it, to overthrow tyranny. Casca agrees, and Cassius continues, saying that the only reason Caesar acts like a tyrant is because he knows Romans are weak and will not resist. Casca and Cassius agree to spearhead the plot to assassinate Caesar.  
	Another conspirator, Cinna, enters. Cassius gives him the letters he has written and tells Cinna to throw them into Brutus's house. After doing this he is to meet Cassius and some other conspirators at Pompey's Porch, which is the portico of a theatre built by Pompey. Cassius tells Casca that Brutus is three-quarters won over to their cause, and on their next meeting he will embrace it fully.  
	Analysis
	As often occurs in Shakespeare's plays (King Lear for example), a disturbance in the macrocosm (the violent storm) indicates a disturbance in the microcosm, the world of man and his society. The scene also reveals more of the central characters: Cassius's ambition for power and Brutus's decency and reputation as a man of honor. This is why the conspirators need Brutus on their side: it will make their cause seem respectable.  
",Julius Caesar
67,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 2, Scene 1","
	 
Brutus reflects in a soliloquy that he has nothing against Caesar personally, but Caesar must be killed for the general good of Rome. He explains that if Caesar is crowned king, that may change his nature, and he may abuse his power. He must be assassinated to prevent this possibility from taking place; in other words, Caesar must be killed not for what he is but for what he may become.  
	Brutus's servant Lucius brings him the letter that Casca has tossed in through the window. Brutus reads it out loud to himself and puzzles over the meaning. The letter urges him to take action for the sake of Rome, and it appears that he has made his decision to join the conspirators. Lucius enters and confirms that the next day is the ides of March. Brutus, alone, confesses that since Cassius first sounded him out about Caesar, he has not slept.  
	The conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius enter. Cassius demands that they take an oath to cement their resolve to assassinate Caesar. But Brutus refuses, saying that they need only their own cause to spur them onward. As Romans they are honor-bound to keep any promise they have made.  
	The conspirators then discuss whether to enlist Cicero in their cause. Cicero is old and wise, and his support would give their cause more legitimacy in the eyes of the people. But Brutus advises against this. He says Cicero will never join an enterprise that is led by anyone other than himself. The conspirators agree to leave him out of their plans. Next they discuss whether they should kill Antony as well as Caesar. Cassius advocates killing them both, because as a close friend of Caesar, Antony could prove troublesome to them. But Brutus says no; killing both men will make the conspirators seem too bloodthirsty, and anyway, Antony will be made powerless when Caesar is killed. Brutus hopes that if they go about their purpose with dignity rather than wrathful passion, the common people will see them not as murderers but as cleansers of the body politic.  
	Cassius remains uneasy, but the conspirators side with Brutus and decide not to kill Antony.  
	It is three in the morning and the conspirators agree to part. But Cassius is concerned that Caesar, whom he believes to be superstitious, may not go to the capital later that morning because of the strange apparitions during the night. Decius says he knows how to talk to Caesar and persuade him. He promises to bring Caesar to the capital. Cassius says they will all be there at eight in the morning to make sure that Caesar comes.  
	After the conspirators leave, Brutus's wife Portia enters. Brutus is surprised to see her up in the middle of the night. She knows Brutus is troubled by something and asks if she may know what it is. Brutus replies that he is sick, but Portia does not believe him. She knows that it is Brutus's mind that is troubled, and again demands to know what is wrong. She reassures him that she is strong enough to know the truth, and that she will not disclose it to anyone. Brutus is touched by her pleas, but then there is a knock at the door, and Brutus sends Portia away, saying that he will tell her everything later.
	At the door is Caius Ligarius. Although he is sick, he is willing to join the conspirators.  
	Analysis
	The scene gives insight into Brutus's character. He thinks deeply about his decision and does not join the conspirators lightly. He thinks not of himself, or what he might gain from the assassination, but of the welfare of Rome. It is also clear that because he is the man most respected in Rome, the other conspirators defer to his judgments. However, Brutus is not always right, as is shown by his comments about how Antony should be spared because he will be powerless without Caesar.  
	The pleadings of Portia reveal Brutus's inner conflict. She is clearly a noble woman, a worthy wife for an honorable Roman, but Brutus cannot bring himself to confide in her. Perhaps he is trying to protect her, but it may also be that he in the inner recesses of his heart he is ashamed of what he has decided to do. Either way, Brutus appears as a man who, although he has decided on a course of action, remains divided against himself.  
	The scene also reveals the extent of Cassius's cunning. He thinks ahead, sees every possible obstacle, and tries to prevent each one.

It is still night, and the storm continues. Caesar's wife has a dream in which Caesar is murdered. She tries to persuade Caesar not to leave the house that day. Caesar will not be persuaded, so Calphurnia recounts some of the strange things that have been seen by the night watch. Graves have given up their dead, and there was the noise of battle in the air. But Caesar still insists he will not change his plans. He says that the disturbances pertain to the world in general, not to himself, and anyway, he does not fear death. Then a servant arrives and tells him that the priests, his spiritual advisers, are also telling him not to go out. Again, Caesar will not listen. But Calphurnia tries again, urging Caesar to send Mark Antony in his place to the Senate, with word that Caesar is sick. Caesar finally agrees to stay at home. 
	But then Decius enters to escort Caesar to the Senate. Caesar explains that he is not going, although he refuses to say that he is sick. Decius says he must give a reason for Caesar's nonappearance, or the Senate will laugh at him when he delivers the news. Caesar says it is simply his will that he will not come. But for Decius's own satisfaction, he confides in him that it is because his wife fears the bad omens in the stormy night. She also had a dream in which she saw his statue running with blood. Decius tells him that the dream has been misinterpreted. It really means that he is the lifeblood of Rome and everyone wants to receive some small aspect of his person, as a blessing. Caesar approves of this interpretation. Decius goes on to say that the Senate plans to award him a crown that day; if he does not arrive in person, they may rethink their decision. Some may say Caesar is afraid. Caesar, convinced by the argument, reverses his decision.  
	Brutus and the other conspirators enter, as well as Publius, who knows nothing of the plot. Antony also arrives. Caesar invites them all to share some wine with him before they all set forth for the capital. 
	Analysis
	This scene further reveals Caesar's character. He thinks of himself as courageous and fearless. However, he is also aware of the power of public opinion, since the one thing that persuades him to go to the capital is not that the senators expect him to, but because if he does not go he may be thought of as fearful. This may turn public opinion against him, since no politician, either in ancient Rome or now, wants to be perceived as lacking in courage.

As Caesar and his company walk to the Senate, Caesar passes the soothsayer, who reminds him that the ides of March are not yet passed. Artemidorus tries to get Caesar to read his letter, and says it is personal. Caesar rejects it, saying that personal items should be dealt with last.  
	Brutus fears that the plot has been discovered when Publius remarks that he hopes their enterprise will thrive. Publius then goes straight to Caesar, and the conspirators fear that he is warning Caesar of the plot. But then they see Publius smiling and notice that Caesar does not react badly to his words.  
	Meanwhile, Trebonius draws Antony out of the way, and the conspirators prepare to put their plan into action. First, Metellus Cimber kneels and puts his petition to Caesar. But Caesar refuses his request. Metellus Cimber's brother will remain banished. Metellus tries again, and Brutus joins him in his plea, to Caesar's surprise. Then Cassius kneels and joins the appeal to Caesar. But Caesar remains unmoved, declaring that he is as constant as the north star. He prides himself on being unbending.  
	As Cinna and Decius protest Caesar's decision, Casca is the first to stab Caesar; the others follow, including Brutus. Cinna and Cassius tell the senators and others who witnessed the assassination to run to the streets and proclaim that tyranny is dead and liberty and freedom live. Brutus tries to reassure the horrified onlookers. He also reassures Publius that they intend no harm to him or anyone else, but he should leave because the people may attack the killers and Publius might be caught in the middle of it. He says that no one should have to face the consequences of this deed except those who performed it.  
	Trebonius enters and informs them that Antony has fled to his house and the whole city is in an uproar. Brutus tells the assassins to cover their arms and swords in Caesar's blood and go to the people proclaiming peace, liberty and freedom.  
	A servant arrives with a conciliatory message from Antony. Antony says that if Brutus will allow him to come safely, he would like to hear their explanation of why Caesar deserved to die. If Brutus will do this, Antony promises him his loyalty. Brutus agrees to these terms and is confident that he will win Antony's support and friendship.  
	Antony enters and says he does not know what they intend, but as far as he is concerned they can kill him now if they wish. He cannot think of any better time than this, the hour of Caesar's death, to die himself.  
	Brutus explains that they acted as they did because of pity for the condition of Rome under Caesar. He adds that they mean no harm to Antony, and Cassius confirms this. Brutus says that they first must calm the populace and then they will explain exactly why they assassinated Caesar. Antony replies that he does not doubt their wisdom, and one by one he shakes the conspirators' hands. But then he praises Caesar and asks forgiveness of him for making peace with his killers.  
	Cassius tries to find out whether Antony will be one of their supporters. Antony replies that he is their friend, but he still wants to hear how they justify their act. Brutus promises they will.  
	Antony asks that he may be permitted to speak at Caesar's funeral. Brutus immediately grants this request, but Cassius pulls him aside, saying that they should refuse to let Antony speak, since he may sway people against them. Brutus tries to reassure him by saying that he will speak first and tell the people why Caesar was killed, and will then emphasize that Antony speaks with their permission. The assassins want Caesar to have all the ceremony that is due to him; Brutus says this will rebound to their advantage. Cassius is not convinced, but he does not oppose Brutus's plan. Brutus gives Antony permission to take Caesar's body. He tells him he may praise Caesar in his speech, but must also say that he does so with their permission.  
	Everyone exits except Antony, who now reveals his true thoughts. He laments the death of such a great man and apologizes for being so meek with the murderers. He promises revenge against Caesar's killers. There will be fierce civil war. Caesar's spirit, accompanied by Ate, the god of discord, will be hot for revenge.  
	A servant of Octavius, Caesar's adopted son, arrives, saying that Octavius is on his way to Rome. Antony sends a message that it is too dangerous for Octavius to come.  
	Finally, Antony says that in his funeral oration, he will test the way the people have received the death of Caesar.  
	Analysis
	It is significant that all the conspirators, rather than just one, stab Caesar. They want to emphasize that they are acting collectively, and that this is the way Rome should be governed, not by one dictatorial leader. By ensuring that they all participate in the killing, they hope to bring more legitimacy to their cause: one man may act from bad motives, but an entire group of respected Romans is more likely to be perceived as acting in good faith for just reasons.  
	After the killing, no one is sure how the crowd, which is as much an actor in this play as any of the characters, will react to the news. The assassins know how volatile the people can be, which is why they immediately try to get a positive message out (rather as modern politicians try to create a positive ""spin"" on important events when they address the media). Another unknown factor is Mark Antony. No one is sure how he is going to react, and the cat-and-mouse game between the politicians begins. Cassius is especially concerned since he knows how dangerous Antony might be. For his part, Antony is in a very tricky situation, and he has to play his cards carefully. When he meets the conspirators, he shows great self-control. He is quite capable of putting on a courteous face to the killers and hinting that he may come round to their cause. But if there was any doubt in the audience's mind about how he really feels, that is removed in his final soliloquy.

Brutus addresses the crowd, saying that while he loved Caesar, he loved Rome more. He asks them whether they would prefer it if Caesar were alive and they all slaves, or Caesar were dead and they were free? Brutus honors Caesar for his bravery but says he killed him because he was ambitious. Who wants to be a slave? he asks. Who does not love his country? He invites a response from the crowd, which cries out in support of him. Brutus concludes that he can have offended no one by his act.  
	As Antony enters with Caesar's body, Brutus tells the crowd that he killed his best friend for the sake of Rome, and that he has the same dagger reserved for himself, when his country should need his death. He then leaves to the cheers of the crowd, insisting that everyone stay to hear Antony's speech. The crowd is convinced by Brutus's speech that Caesar was a tyrant.  
	Antony addresses the crowd. He says he came to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Brutus has said that Caesar was ambitious, and if that was true, then it was a bad fault in Caesar, and he has fully paid for it.  
	Antony points out that he speaks with the permission of the assassins, and he calls Brutus an honorable man, as are all they all. He says that Caesar was his friend and always behaved fairly to him. Then he repeats that Brutus said Caesar was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. But then he begins to cast doubt on the case against Caesar. He points out that Caesar brought home many captives to Rome, whose ransoms increased Rome's revenues. Was that ambitious? When the poor suffered, Caesar pitied and wept with them. Did that seem ambitious? He repeats for a third time that that Brutus said Caesar was ambitious, and that Brutus is an honorable man. 
	Next, he reminds the crowd that three times he tried to present Caesar with a crown, and each time Caesar rejected it. Was that ambitious? Once more Antony repeats the reference to Brutus and the fact that he is honorable. He claims that he is not there to disprove what Brutus has said, only to speak what he knows. He asks the crowd that since they all loved Caesar once, why can they not mourn for him? For a moment he is overcome by tears and has to pause.  
	Antony's speech is beginning to have its effect. Convinced by the points he has made, the crowd is ready to change sides and denounce Brutus.  
	Continuing, Antony claims it is not his intention to stir up rage against Cassius and Brutus (who are honorable men). Then he produces Caesar's will. If the people could hear it, he says, even though he does not intend to read it, they would kiss Caesar's wounds, by which he means that they would be extremely grateful to him.  
	The crowd clamors to hear the will, but Antony says it is not good for them to know how much Caesar loved them; it will only inflame them and make them angry. 
	The crowd continues to call for the will. Persuaded by the clamor, tells them to form a circle around Caesar's corpse. Antony points to each of the many wounds in Caesar's mantle, describing which was made by which conspirator. He makes particular play with the wound caused by Brutus, whom Caesar loved. When Caesar saw Brutus stab him, he was overcome by Brutus' ingratitude far more than any physical wounds. For the first time, Antony refers to the assassination as treason.  
	Then he pulls back the mantle and shows Caesar's body. The crowd is shocked and calls for revenge. Antony asks them to restrain themselves, although as he explains himself, referring again to the ""honorable"" men who killed Caesar, and saying that he has no gift of oratory, unlike Brutus, to stir men to action. But if he were Brutus, and Brutus Antony, then he would speak with passion and call for mutiny in Rome.  
	The crowd is about to scatter and stir up a rebellion when Antony reminds them that they have not heard the will yet. Antony announces that Caesar gives to every Roman citizen the sum of seventy-five drachmaes. He has also left his forest and orchards to be public pleasure-grounds, where anyone can walk.  
	The common people rush off, vowing to burn down the assassins' houses. Antony is satisfied at what his words have achieved and waits for whatever events unfold.  
	A servant enters and tells Antony that Octavius, and Lepidus have arrived. He also says that Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome. Antony assumes it is because they heard of how he had stirred the people up against them.  
	Analysis
	Brutus makes an effective speech that appeals to reason. But he is far surpassed by the brilliant cunning of Antony, who plays directly on the emotions of the crowd. Through the use of irony, he not only manages to suggest that Brutus and his fellow conspirators are not honorable men, he does so without violating the conditions imposed on him: that he not speak ill of the assassins. Not only are Antony's words devastating in the way they undermine Brutus's speech, he is also a master actor. The pause for tears, for example, whether sincere or not, is dramatically effective, and Antony's use of his props, the dead body-who could not be moved by the sight of Caesar's bloody corpse?-and the will, are also superb in their timing and effect.  
	It is clear that Brutus has made a series of miscalculations. His biggest mistake is to allow Antony to speak at the funeral. He then compounds the error by leaving the scene after his own speech, which effectively gives Antony the last word. It seems that Brutus is so concerned with acting nobly (or perhaps trying to convince everyone, including himself, that he is doing so), that he makes the kind of blunders that Cassius, more ruthless and with a fiercer hunger for power, would never have made if left to himself. In the game of power politics, ruthlessness pays bigger dividends than nobility.

In a street in Rome, Cinna the poet is accosted by a crowd of pro-Caesar commoners. He says he is going to Caesar's funeral-as a friend. When he says his name is Cinna, the crowd wants to kill him, since they think he is one of the conspirators. Even though he protests that he is Cinna the poet, they drag him off just the same.  
	Analysis
	Perhaps the reason for this short scene is to show the savagery and irrationality of the mob when ignited by bloodlust. It does not matter to them that Cinna had nothing to do with the assassination.

At Antony's house in Rome, Antony, Lepidus and Octavius are negotiating about who should be killed. Lepidus accepts that his brother must be one of them, but on condition that Publius, Antony's nephew, also dies. Antony consents. 
	Antony sends Lepidus on an errand, and then complains to Octavius that Lepidus is not worthy to be one of the three leaders of the Roman Empire. When Octavius points out that Antony just accepted Lepidus's vote on a matter of life and death, Antony replies that Lepidus has his uses, but is of no more worth than a beast of burden, which having carried the load required of it can be dispatched to a pasture. Octavius protests that Lepidus is a brave soldier. Antony replies that so is his own horse. And just as a horse has to be trained, so Lepidus is a follower, not a leader. He has to be taught what to do. He should be considered a tool, to be used by others.  
	Antony informs Octavius that Brutus and Cassius are raising an army against them, and they must prepare to respond.  
	Analysis
	This scene shows the balance of power in the triumvirate. Lepidus is of no consequence, and Antony, as the older man and more experienced soldier, has the upper hand over Octavius.

At a camp near Sardis, Brutus and his generals enter. Brutus hints at some slight he has suffered at the hands of Cassius. He inquires of Lucilius how Cassius received him. Lucilius replies that he was greeted with respect but without the usual friendliness. Brutus interprets this to mean that his friendship with Cassius has grown cold and that he can no longer rely on it.  
	Cassius enters and accuses Brutus of wronging him. Brutus denies it, but does not want to dispute in front of their generals. He takes Cassius inside his tent so they can discuss the matter alone.

Cassius explains that Brutus accused a man named Lucius Pella of taking bribes. Cassius wrote to him, saying that he knew Lucius Pella was innocent. But Brutus just ignored him.  
	Brutus says it was unnecessary for Cassius to intervene in such a small matter. Then he says that Cassius himself sometimes allows unworthy people to buy offices in his service. Cassius, angered, says that if anyone other than Brutus made such a remark, he would kill him. But Brutus is not intimidated. He says that they killed Caesar in the name of justice. Should one of them now accept bribes?  
	Cassius warns him to stop, and says he is more experienced than Brutus and therefore able to make management decisions. They fall to quarreling. Brutus tells Cassius he is hot-tempered and should control his anger. But Brutus will not let it disturb him. They quarrel further over whether Cassius said he was a better soldier than Brutus. Cassius says that even Caesar would not have dared to anger him in this way, and Brutus responds by saying Cassius would not have dared to have provoked him to anger.  
	Brutus then goes to the heart of the matter. He wrote to Cassius, asking for money so he could pay his soldiers, because he could not bring himself to raise it by taxing the peasants. But Cassius refused.  
	Cassius denies the charge and blames his messenger. He protests that Brutus exaggerates his faults. He gives a despairing speech in which he says he is weary of the world, and he invites Brutus to kill him with his own dagger. This breaks the tension, because Brutus realizes that it is better just to let Cassius be angry when the mood takes him. It is soon over. Brutus confesses that he spoke in anger too. They are reconciled. Brutus promises that if Cassius should be angry with him in the future, he will not take it so seriously.  
	There is a disturbance outside as a poet urges the two men to be friends. After this, Brutus explains to Cassius that he is weighed down by grief, and that is why he became angry. His wife Portia, distressed by his absence and the strength of Octavius and Antony, committed suicide by swallowing burning coals. Brutus and Cassius drink wine to forget their sorrows.  
	Titinius and Messala enter and describe the military situation. Octavius and Antony are marching on them with a large army. They have put a hundred senators to death. Brutus has different information, that only seventy senators were killed.  
	Brutus raises the question of whether they should march to Philippi to meet the opposing army. Cassius says it would be better not to. They should let Antony's army advance, so they get exhausted, while Brutus and Cassius's forces stay fresh. Brutus disagrees. He warns that as the opposing army advances, they may pick up new recruits from the towns they pass through, where Brutus and Cassius are unpopular. But if Brutus and Cassius march on Philippi, they can prevent this happening. He insists that the time is right for them to strike. Their forces are at their strongest. If they wait, their strength may decline, while the enemy's will increase. Cassius accepts Brutus's argument and they part on good terms.  
	Brutus's servant Lucius plays some music. After Lucius falls asleep, Brutus reads a book. He is startled by the appearance of the ghost of Caesar. The ghost says that he will reappear to Brutus at Philippi. Then he disappears. Brutus awakens his servants, but none of them saw the ghost.  
	Analysis
	This scene shows the instability of the alliance between Brutus and Cassius. First, their personalities clash. Cassius is hot-tempered, but Brutus, although calmer, becomes tiresome in his insistence on his own honesty and rectitude. Second, the two men rarely agree on strategy. Cassius again makes the mistake of deferring to Brutus's judgment. But the scene also shows Brutus's decency, in his gentle concern for the welfare of his servants. We are also reminded that although Caesar is dead, his ghostly presence still dominates the play.

On the plains of Philippi, Octavius and Antony discuss the situation. Octavius says the enemy is planning to attack, contrary to what Antony had suggested. Antony replies that they are just putting on a false show of courage. The two men prepare for battle, although they disagree on tactics. Antony wants Octavius to take the left side of the field, while he takes the right. Octavius wants it the other way around.  
	Before the battle begins, Octavius, Antony, Brutus and Cassius meet and trade insults. Cassius reproaches Brutus for sparing Antony's life. If he had not done so, they would not now have to listen to his aggressive words. Octavius says he will not stop until Caesar's death is avenged. Cassius denounces him as a schoolboy who does not deserve the honor of being killed by Brutus; he also insults Antony's love of revelry. Antony and Octavius depart, ready for battle. 
	Cassius tells his servant Messala that it is his birthday. He also tells of an omen: as they journeyed from Sardis, two eagles swooped down and perched on their banner. The eagles remained there all the way to Philippi. But that morning they departed. In their place are ravens, crows and kites, which look down on Cassius's army as if they were prey. He fears that this is a bad omen. Messala urges him not to believe it, and Cassius says he only partly does, and he is fresh and ready for battle.  
	Cassius tells Brutus that if they lose this battle, this will be the last time they speak to each other. He asks what Brutus would plan to do in such a situation. Brutus says he does not intend to commit suicide. Cassius asks him if he would allow himself to be led in triumph through the streets of Rome. Brutus says this will never happen. They bid each other an affectionate farewell.  
	Analysis
	Antony and Octavius are supremely confident. The focus of the scene is on Brutus and Cassius, who contemplate the coming battle with a sense of fatalism. Although they do not say it outright, they fear they will be defeated.

He sends Pindarus higher up the hill to gather information. But Cassius knows in his heart that he is defeated. Pindarus reports that Titinius has been captured. This is the final blow for Cassius, who instructs Pindarus to kill him with his sword, the same sword that killed Caesar. Cassius dies.  
	Titanius and Messala enter, reporting that Brutus has triumphed over Octavius even as Cassius's army has fallen to Antony. They discover the dead Cassius. Titanius laments that Cassius killed himself because he misunderstood the situation. Titanius had in fact been welcomed and treated like a friend; he had not been captured at all. Filled with grief, he kills himself.  
	Brutus enters with Messala, who has brought him the news of Cassius's death. Brutus exclaims that Caesar is mighty yet, and it is his spirit that has caused their defeat. He laments the death of two great Romans, and then tells his generals to prepare for another round of battle.

82,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - Awakening,"
	Siddhartha leaves the grove where the Buddha lives, feeling that he has left his former life behind. He no longer has a desire to listen to teachers. Deciding that in seeking for the Divine, he has lost himself, he resolves no longer to try to escape from himself. He will no longer despise the world and regard it as an illusion. He would find meaning in the world, not beyond it. He would start his life afresh. He has a few moments of loneliness, when he realizes how isolated he is, since he is now putting his old life behind him. He knows he cannot return to his father, the Brahmin priest. But he quickly regains confidence and walks forward briskly.
	Analysis
	In this short chapter Siddhartha undergoes an apparent reversal of his thinking. Up to this point, his goal has been to discover the ultimate reality of life that lies beyond the five senses. He had accepted the idea that the senses take a person away from the underlying truth. The reality, he believed, was an absolute, silent, universal consciousness that lay beyond the things of the world. The goal of the spiritual life was to access that silent, pure consciousness within oneself. Then one would realize that the Atman (the essence of the individual self) was the same as Brahman (the universal self). In this belief he is in accord with a long tradition of Indian religious thought. The world is seen as maya, or illusion, since it is just the play of temporary, impermanent forms, not the underlying reality that gives rise to those forms. But in this chapter, Siddhartha takes a new view. He decides that the divine can also be found in the world, because everything in creation is just the One expressing itself in multiple forms. There is no dichotomy between the absolute One and the multitude of relative forms the One takes on. In reaching this new understanding, Siddhartha has opened himself up to another aspect of traditional Indian thought. It is a paradox. The world is maya, it is not the divine (because it is impermanent), and yet it is also an expression of the divine. It is unity expressing itself through diversity. This sounds very abstract and it is. It is difficult to grasp at an intellectual level. It has to be directly experienced. This is indeed Siddhartha's complaint about the teachings he has so far encountered. They seem to him to lack that vital ingredient of direct experience. The experience of seeing the entire universe as an expression of one unified, divine consciousness manifesting through a multiplicity of forms will ultimately enlighten Siddhartha. But at the moment he is a long way from his goal. In fact, he is ready to forget it altogether.

In the morning they see the Buddha himself. He looks like the hundreds of other monks, but Siddhartha recognizes him by the complete peacefulness of his demeanor. In the evening, Siddhartha and Govinda listen to the Buddha preach about the way to gain release from suffering. Govinda is convinced by what he hears and joins the Buddha's community. Siddhartha gives him his blessing, but he has no intention of pursuing the same path. He tells his friend that he will be leaving him. In the morning Siddhartha speaks to the Buddha in person. Siddhartha acknowledges the wisdom and clarity of the Buddha's explanation of the chain of cause and effect in life, but he thinks he has found a flaw in the teaching. If it is possible to rise above the world and gain salvation, as the Buddha says, this means that the law of cause and effect has broken down. It is not a complete explanation of life. The Buddha replies that his goal is not to explain the world but to give salvation from suffering. Siddhartha then comments that in none of the Buddha's teachings does he explain the secret of what he experienced in his moment of enlightenment. Siddhartha says that he plans to leave all doctrines and teachers behind and reach his goal alone. The Buddha acknowledges that Siddhartha is clever, but warns him not to be too clever.
	Analysis
	The Buddha lived from about 563-483 B.C. in northern India. His given name was Gautama (or Gotama); the Buddha was a title given to him, meaning the enlightened or the awakened one. Unlike Siddhartha, the Buddha was not born into a Brahmin family. His father was from the warrior, or ksatriya, class. As a young man Gautama decided to renounce the world and seek a cure for human suffering. He became an ascetic and went in search of a teacher who could point him to the Truth, but none of the teachers he met satisfied him. After giving up his ascetic practices, he gained enlightenment while engaged in deep meditation. Traditionally, this moment happened near Gaya, in the modern state of Bihar, on the bank of the river Neranjara, a tributary of the sacred Ganges river. After this experience, the Buddha set out to teach others the path to salvation. When Govinda and Siddhartha hear him preach, the Buddha refers to the ""four main points"" and the ""Eightfold Path.""
	The first of these is often known as the Four Noble Truths. These truth are 1) life is suffering; 2) the origin of suffering lies in desire, or craving; 3) the cessation of suffering can be gained by the removal of desire; 4) the way to attain this is through the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is a set of prescriptions about how life should be lived, involving right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, and the correct approach to meditation.

84,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - The Brahmin's Son,"Siddhartha is a young boy in India during the sixth century B.C., the time of the Buddha. He is the son of a Brahmin, a member of the priestly cast. Siddhartha is admired by all his family and friends, including Govinda, and he is expected to become a Brahmin priest. However, in spite of the fact that Siddhartha is much loved and has the gift of making others happy, he is not himself happy. On the contrary, he is restless and discontent. He senses that neither his father nor the other Brahmins who are in charge of his education really know the way to enlightenment, which Siddhartha believes to be the only knowledge worth having. The men have profound theoretical knowledge about enlightenment, but Siddhartha questions whether they really experience this exalted state. He thinks they are all still spiritual seekers, just as he is.
	One day Siddhartha sees three wandering ascetics, known as Samanas, as they pass through the town. They are thin and almost naked. Siddhartha tells Govinda that the following morning he will join the Samanas. Govinda is dismayed. Siddhartha respectfully asks his father for permission to leave the house and become a Samana. His father is not pleased, but eventually, when he sees how determined Siddhartha is, and realizes that his son has already left him in spirit, he gives his permission. As Siddhartha leaves town at daybreak, Govinda joins him.
	Analysis
	In India during the sixth century B.C., the religion was known as Vedism or Brahmanism. The Vedas are a collection of hymns to the gods dating from the period 1300 B.C. to 900 B.C. Veda literally means knowledge. The Vedic gods include Agni, the god of fire, and Indra, the warrior god. During the period from the eighth to the fifth century B.C., the philosophical texts known as the Upanishads were added to the canon of Vedic scriptures.
	Brahmins were the priestly caste who performed the Vedic sacrificial rituals. Siddhartha would have been expected to learn all these rituals and become a learned Brahmin, just like his father. Already as a boy he is aware of the central doctrine of the Upanishads. The Upanishads stated that the essence of each person's self, the Atman, was identical with the universal spirit, or Brahman. The goal of meditation was to realize the essential oneness of the individual and the universal soul. The word Om that Siddhartha mentions is a mantra, a word that is chanted or repeated silently in order to take the attention away from the outer world of the senses. When the mind is stilled in this way, the identity of Atman with Brahman becomes apparent; the individual consciousness is known to the same as the universal consciousness. In this chapter Siddhartha reveals that he has already been taught the technique of meditating using Om as a mantra. He has also been trained in the doctrine of the Upanishads: ""Already he knew how to recognize Atman within the depth of his being, indestructible, at one with the universe"" (p. 2). It is this experience that feeds Siddhartha's longing. He sees in the Brahmins only a vast parade of outer learning, but the inner core, the direct experience of enlightenment, is missing. Enlightenment dawns when the reality of the identity of Atman and Brahman, the individual and the universal, is experienced at every moment of every day.

85,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - With the Samanas,"Part One
	With the Samanas
	Siddhartha and Govinda join the Samanas and learn their ascetic practices. Siddhartha fasts until he grows thin, and he develops a contempt for the things of the world. His aim is to conquer desire and experience the innermost core of being. He tries to overcome pain, hunger, thirst and fatigue by experiencing all of them to extreme degrees. He also practices stilling the breath through meditation. But he is dissatisfied with what he learns. He has not found out how to permanently lose his small, individual self. In a discussion with Govinda, he points out that the oldest Samana is about sixty, and he has still not attained the liberated condition known as Nirvana. Siddhartha doubts whether any of the Samanas will attain Nirvana. Govinda is shocked, and is even more distressed when Siddhartha says that he will soon be leaving the Samanas.
	After being with the Samanas for three years, Siddhartha and Govinda hear rumors about a man named Gotama, the Buddha. It was said that he had attained Nirvana and no longer experienced the sorrows of the world. Govinda is keen for them both to go and see the Buddha. Siddhartha, however, has learned to mistrust spiritual teachers, but Govinda persuades him to visit the Buddha. The leader of the Samanas is angry that the two young men want to leave him, but Siddhartha imposes his will on the old man, who then gives them his blessings.
	Analysis
	Ascetic practices can be found at some point in the history of almost every religion. They rest on the belief that there is a dichotomy between the body and the soul, the flesh and the spirit. If the body can be denied the fulfillment of its desires, then it will be conquered, and the individual will have attained a spiritual state. In such a condition, the passions and desires of the small, individual self will not interfere with the serenity of the innermost being, which is stillness, not passion. But Siddhartha finds that the techniques of asceticism do not work. The Samanas do not gain enlightenment, however hard they try. Once Siddhartha has decided to leave them, he never again practices such mortification of the body.
	The word Nirvana Siddhartha uses in this chapter to describe the condition of liberation is slightly anachronistic, since the term is usually associated with Buddhism, which Siddhartha has not yet encountered. Nirvana is a term that is difficult to translate or define accurately. It refers to the realization of the ultimate reality, but it should not be confused with the Christian concept of heaven.

Siddhartha proves himself to be a valuable asset to Kamaswami's business, although he does not take it as seriously as the merchant does. It seems like a game to him and he does not worry about profits and losses. This is quite unlike Kamaswami, who worries and loses sleep whenever a transaction goes wrong. For Siddhartha, business is useful only because it brings him money to spend on Kamala. For the most part, he remains detached from the lives of other people, not sharing what he thinks is the pettiness of their concerns. His heart lies elsewhere. Talking with Kamala, he decides that they are similar. They are not like ordinary people. She says he is still a Samana at heart, because in his heart he loves no one. Siddhartha thinks that Kamala does not really love anyone either.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha flourishes in his new worldly occupations in part because of the legacy of his many years as a Samana and spiritual seeker. He does not get involved too seriously in the world's affairs. He remains essentially unattached, unlike the worldly merchant Kamaswami. When he begins this new life as merchant and lover, Siddhartha is like a freshly polished diamond. All his years of spiritual practice have given him a quiet strength and resilience that can easily withstand the stresses and strains of worldly life. It will take quite a while for the shine to be rubbed off that diamond. Siddhartha is rather ignorant in this respect; he has no idea of where the path he has chosen to follow will lead him. He will find out in the next chapter.

87,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - By the River,"Siddhartha wanders into the forest, knowing that he can never return to his former life. He is disgusted with his life and wants only oblivion. When he reaches the river, the same river he had been ferried across as a young man, he wants to throw himself into it and drown. Then he hears the holy word OM, which means ""perfection,"" welling up from within his soul, and for a moment he remembers the divine, and regrets that he had wished to die. He falls asleep and wakes up many hours later, feeling refreshed. It is as if he has been reborn. He sees a monk in a yellow gown sitting opposite him, and immediately recognizes him to be his old friend, Govinda. Govinda is still a disciple of the Buddha, and is on a pilgrimage. Govinda does not recognize Siddhartha until Siddhartha identifies himself. Siddhartha says that although he is not going anywhere in particular, he is on a pilgrimage, which surprises Govinda because Siddhartha is still dressed in his rich clothes. The two men part on friendly terms, although Govinda is mystified by what his friend tells him. After Govinda leaves, Siddhartha reflects on his life. He feels he has returned to how he was as a child, without possessions, and without knowledge. He accepts all his experiences that have led him to this point, and he is happy. He realizes that when he was a Brahmin and an ascetic, too much knowledge had hindered him, and he had been arrogant. He had had to go out and lose himself in worldly activities because that was the only way the arrogant Brahmin self could be destroyed. Then, out of his despair, a new man could arise.
	Analysis
	When he arrives at the river, Siddhartha's true awakening can begin. The river acts as a symbol of the totality of life, the unity and the diversity together, that Siddhartha must experience if he is to comprehend the ultimate nature of life. However, he is not yet aware of the full significance of the river. He only knows that he loves it and wants to stay near it. He has a great deal still to learn, but he is finally on the right track.
	Govinda returns to the story in this chapter to serve as a contrast to Siddhartha. Govinda is content to be a follower of the Buddha, to live within a set of teachings and doctrines he accepts. Siddhartha, on the other hand, must forge his own path.
",Siddhartha
88,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Govinda,"
	Govinda has heard talk of the wise old ferryman, and goes to see him. Siddhartha takes him across the river, but as happened the last time they met, Govinda does not recognize his old friend until Siddhartha reveals his identity. Govinda stays the night in Siddhartha's hut. Govinda asks Siddhartha whether he follows any teachings or doctrine. Siddhartha replies that wisdom, unlike knowledge, is not communicable. He explains that life should not be divided into the opposites of good and evil but accepted in its totality as an expression of perfection. Everything is good and necessary, death as well as life, sin as well as holiness, wisdom as well as folly. He sees infinite value in everything in creation, even a stone. He still distrusts teachings and words. He is no longer concerned, as Govinda still is, about whether the things in the world are real or illusory. The important thing, Siddhartha says, is that he should love them. Love is the most important thing in the world. Govinda replies that the Buddha did not preach love, because love would binds a person to earth rather than ensuring his salvation. Siddhartha admits there seems to be a contradiction between his own beliefs and the teachings of the Buddha, but he says the apparent contradiction is an illusion. He regards the Buddha as a great man who expressed great love for humanity. As Govinda prepares to leave, he thinks that Siddhartha is a strange man with strange thoughts. And yet he also acknowledges that Siddhartha radiates a purity and peace that he has encountered in no man other than the Buddha. He asks Siddhartha to give him something that will help him on his spiritual quest. Siddhartha asks him to kiss him on the forehead. As he does this, Govinda receives an experience of the unity of life in the midst of all its diversity. He sees all forms of life changing and being reborn, but he sees no death. He sees Siddhartha's smiling face as a smile of unity that somehow embraces all the changing forms. This smile of Siddhartha is exactly like the smile Govinda had perceived a hundred times in the smile of the Buddha. This is Govinda's moment of enlightenment. He bows low to Siddhartha, whose smile reminds him of everything he had ever loved in his life.
	Analysis
	In this final chapter, Siddhartha tries to give an explanation in words to Govinda of his experience of enlightenment that was described in the previous chapter. This explanation acts as both a reprise of Siddhartha's experience and a prelude to Govinda's, since Govinda's moment of awakening is essentially the same as Siddhartha's. The significance of repeating it through Govinda is that Siddhartha is now able not only to experience this exalted perception of life for himself but to pass it on to others.
	This chapter reinforces the recurring theme of the book, that merely following the doctrines of a teacher is not going to get a person enlightened. Govinda has spent all his life as a spiritual seeker, and although he is respected by the other monks, he has not found what he needs. Siddhartha has succeeded by going his own way, listening to his heart, and finally learning how to listen to and be aware of the totality of life. It is true that he was helped by Vasudeva, but the ferryman, with his few words and no doctrine, was a very different kind of spiritual teacher than Gotama the Buddha.
	The final emphasis is on the smile on the face of Siddhartha, which is indistinguishable from the smile of the Buddha. The Buddha is often depicted with a quiet, serene smile on his face. People read into this smile a variety of things: it is seen as a promise that salvation is possible, or as evidence that the ultimate reality of life, underlying the pain, is bliss, or simply as a smile of compassion. Hesse interprets it as the ""smile of unity over the flowing forms,"" which is in keeping with his view of enlightenment as the experience of unity amidst the infinite diversity of life.

89,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Kamala,"Part Two
	Kamala
	As he journeys along his way, Siddhartha appreciates the beauty of the world in a way he has never done before. He resolves to gain more experience by following the voice of his own heart. After a strange dream in which his friend Govinda appears but then turns into a woman, Siddhartha gets a ferryman to take him across the river. At midday he passes through a village. He greets a young woman, and she makes an amorous gesture, and he kisses her breast. But then an inner voice checks him, and he moves on, past the disappointed woman.
	He reaches a large town, where he sees a beautiful woman in a sedan chair carried by four people. He is enchanted by her beauty. On inquiry, he learns that the woman is Kamala, a well-known courtesan. Next morning, Siddhartha has his beard shaved off, his hair combed, and he bathes in the river. He sees Kamala again and speaks to her, asking her to be his teacher in matters of love, since he knows nothing of the art. She tells him that in order to be good enough for her, he must have fine clothes and shoes, and the money to buy her gifts. Siddhartha replies that he will come to her again when he has what he now lacks. Before he leaves he asks her advice about where he can get these things. He says that as a Samana all he can do is think, wait, and fast. But he can also compose poetry, and he recites a poem for her, and about her, on the spot. Kamala says his poetry is good and she kisses him, but tells him that he will not earn as much money as he needs from poetry. She orders her servant to give him a white gown. He leaves and returns the next day. She tells him that through others, she has spoken to Kamaswami, a rich merchant. He is expecting Siddhartha to call on him. If Siddhartha pleases him, the merchant will take him into his service. Siddhartha is confident that he will get whatever he wants because his years as a Samana have taught him how to focus single-mindedly on a goal.
	Analysis
	One aspect of the Buddhist Eightfold Path is celibacy. The fact that Siddhartha now decides to court Kamala is a clear rejection of this path. He is determined to experience to the full all that the world has to offer, although in following his own heart he convinces himself that that was exactly what the Buddha had done.

90,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Om,"
	Now that he has felt the pain of losing his son, Siddhartha has more sympathy with the needs and desires of ordinary people. He again decides to seek his son in the town, but stops when he thinks he hears a special message from the river. He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.
	Analysis
	The painful experience of the loss of his son is important for Siddhartha because it helps him to develop compassion for others. The necessity of compassion is an important element in Buddhist thought.
	This chapter also reveals the exalted status of Vasudeva, the humble ferryman. He is himself an enlightened man (""his steps full of peace, his face glowing, his form full of light"") and he helps Siddhartha gain the same experience. In Buddhist thought, enlightenment is the knowledge that takes a person ""to the other shore,"" and this is the symbolic significance of what Vasudeva has been doing all his life-ferrying people from one side of the river to the other.
	The mystical experience that Siddhartha has in this chapter is the goal to which everything else in his life has been leading. The river yields up the final truth about life. Siddhartha apprehends all human experience, whether joy or sorrow, as part of a vast unity. Individuals, with their desires and longings, are like rivers flowing to the ocean; they all reach their goal and are reborn in some other form, just as water is ""reborn"" as vapor and rain. When Siddhartha hears (this is a metaphor for direct experience with all aspects of his being) all these individual songs of life singing in harmony as one great whole, he knows the perfection of life. He realizes that everything is as it should be; it cannot be improved upon, and he accepts his own place in it.
	This is Hesse's somewhat idiosyncratic version of what enlightenment is like-an expanded, cosmic perception of all opposites joined together in unity. It should not be automatically assumed that this is what the Buddha spoke of, or that the historical Buddha's experience of enlightenment was anything like this. There are, however, some similarities. According to Buddhist scriptural accounts of the Buddha's enlightenment, he was in these moments able to recollect all his former births, and to see with the ""heavenly eye"" over the entire world. The world appeared to him in perfect clarity, as if reflected in a spotless mirror. This is rather like the perfect clarity with which Siddhartha sees the world as he gazes into the river.
	Like most mystical experiences, Siddhartha's is hard to comprehend with the rational intellect. The mystic will say that this level of reality cannot be conveyed by words; it must be directly experienced for oneself.

91,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Samsara,"Part Two
	Samsara
	Years go by. Siddhartha becomes rich, with a house and servants of his own. The things of the world take possession of him, and he loses the spiritual longings of his youth. He becomes more like the ordinary people from whom he had once felt so detached. A weariness settles over him, which becomes more pronounced as each year goes by. He becomes acquisitive, and values possessions and riches in a way that he had never done before. They become a burden to him. He also becomes addicted to gambling with dice. He wins and loses large amounts of money. Eventually, when Siddhartha is in his forties, he becomes sick of his life. It seems empty and worthless to him. One day he sits under a mango tree in his garden and realizes that he must change his life. He can no longer go on living in the same way. That night he leaves town, never to return. Kamala is not surprised, because she always expected that one day he would leave. She also discovers that she is pregnant by him.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha cannot forever deny his spiritual nature. He was born to realize the Truth, but he allows his spiritual side to become overshadowed by worldly activities. He finds out for himself that what the world offers-riches, sex, all kinds of possessions-gradually obscures the truth. It obscures the reality of Brahman, the universal self, and Siddhartha eventually identifies only with the small individual self, the self that loves and hates, has joys and sorrows, gains and losses, all of which are keenly felt. Throughout all these years of ""success,"" Siddhartha's life was in fact shrinking, even though to outward observance it was expanding with riches and influence. It is not surprising that a man of Siddhartha's spiritual temperament should get fed up with it. He identifies the state he has fallen into as samsara, which is a Sanskrit word meaning confusion or ignorance.

92,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - The Ferryman,"Part Two
	The Ferryman
	Siddhartha decides to stay near the river, which he loves. His inner voice tells him he can learn from it. The river is always flowing on and yet it is always present; its is always different and yet always the same. Hungry, Siddhartha walks along the river bank to the ferry. The ferryman is the same man who conveyed him across the river many years ago. As they cross the river, Siddhartha says he has no money to pay the ferryman, but will offer his rich clothes instead. He hopes the ferryman can give him some old clothes to wear in exchange, and employ him as an apprentice. The ferryman, whose name is Vasudeva, agrees to take him in as a guest. That night Siddhartha tells Vasudeva the story of his life, and Vasudeva, whose wife died many years ago, invites Siddhartha to live with him. Siddhartha accepts.
	Days and months pass quickly. Siddhartha learns how to look after the boat, and he also learns from the river, as Vasudeva said he would. He learns that just as the river is always present everywhere, and has neither a past nor a future, so it is with life. There is no such thing as time. This discovery makes him very happy.
	As time goes by, Siddhartha begins to look as radiant and as happy as Vasudeva does. They both listen to the voice of the river. They begin to get a reputation among travelers for being holy men. One day, a group of monks come to be ferried across the river. They are going to see Gotama the Buddha, who is seriously ill and will shortly die. A stream of pilgrims come as the news spreads. They include Kamala, who has long since given up her life as a courtesan and taken refuge in the teachings of the Buddha. She has her young son with her. When they are not far from the ferry, a snake bites Kamala. She and her son run to the ferry, but Kamala collapses. They cry out for help. Vasudeva hears them and carries Kamala back to his hut. Siddhartha immediately recognizes her. They exchange kind words, and Siddhartha puts his son on his knee and recites a Brahmin prayer for him. Kamala is dying. She asks Siddhartha whether he has found peace, and as he smiles at her she realizes that he has. Kamala finds the same peace for herself as she gazes at Siddhartha in her last moments before death. That night, Siddhartha sits alone in front of the hut, listening to the river. In the morning, he and Vasudeva build Kamala's funeral pyre.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha, who has in the past scorned teachers, finds in Vasudeva a teacher who teaches no doctrines and uses few words. He simply listens to what Siddhartha has to say, and sometimes directs Siddhartha to listen to the river. It is through this practice of listening to the river and observing it that Siddhartha comes to the conclusion that time does not exist. Everything exists in a simultaneous present. Time is merely a construct that the intellect places on events in order to categorize and understand them. But it is not real. This profound realization serves only as a preliminary awakening, however. Siddhartha has realized this truth intellectually, but he has yet to know it as a matter of direct experience. This will only come in his moment of enlightenment.
	The death of Kamala reinforces that fact that Siddhartha's own involvement in the sensual world is over. Once he had played the role of a lover, but now, with the same woman, he plays a different role. The peace Kamala experiences as she gazes on Siddhartha's face in her last moments is utterly different from the physical ecstasy they had known together in the act of love. It shows how far Siddhartha has progressed on the spiritual path. He is able to communicate peace to others. This episode also foreshadows the experience Govinda will have in the final chapter.

93,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - The Son,"

	Siddhartha's eleven-year-old son finds it difficult to adjust to life with his father in a small hut. He has been used to riches and luxury. Siddhartha waits patiently, hoping to win the boy over, but young Siddhartha shows no sign of returning his father's love. Vasudeva advises him to take the boy to the town, find him a teacher and allow him to mix with boys and girls of his own age. Siddhartha is reluctant to part with his son, because he does not want him to repeat the mistakes of his father. Vasudeva tells he must let the boy work out his own destiny. But Siddhartha loves his son too much to let him go. Eventually the boy turns against his father, declaring his hatred and contempt for him. The next day he runs away. Against the advice of Vasudeva, Siddhartha goes looking for his son in the forest, and then in the town. He sees the pleasure garden where he first met Kamala, and for a long time he is lost in thoughts of his past. Then he realizes that he cannot help his son and must not force himself on the boy. He sits down, depressed. Some time later, Vasudeva comes to collect him, and the two men return in silence to their hut.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha has traveled a long way on the spiritual path, but he has not quite reached his goal. He is too deeply attached in a human way to his own son, and his love blinds him to what is best for the boy. He is trying to hold on to life and shape it the way he thinks it should be, instead of letting it go where it must go. It is as if he is putting his hands in the river and trying to prevent the water flowing on. The task is hopeless, but in this chapter only Vasudeva realizes this.

94,The Portrait of a Lady: Novel Summary,"Summary – Chapter One and Chapter Two
	The first-person narrator describes an afternoon tea on the lawn of an old English country house ‘in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon’. There is an old man sitting on the lawn sipping a cup of tea and two younger men strolling to and fro. The old man is looking at the house, which has a name and a history. It had been built under Edward the Sixth and Elizabeth stayed there for a night. It is now in the hands of ‘a shrewd American banker’ (the man who is sitting) who originally bought it because it was a bargain, but 20 years later ‘had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it’.
	One of the other men is a 35-year-old English man called Lord Warburton. The third man, Ralph Touchett, looks ‘clever and ill’ and is the son of the old one.
	The three talk and Lord Warburton says how he finds it difficult to apply Mr. Touchett’s advice to ‘take hold’ of something. His companion tells him he ought to take hold of a pretty woman as he is trying hard to fall in love. Mr. Touchett tells him to ‘make up to a good one and marry her’ and his life will become much more interesting. He then instructs him to fall in love with whomsoever he pleases, but it must not be his niece. Ralph laughs and says this will be a provocation for Lord Warburton and explains how his father has lived with the English for 30 years but has ‘never learned the things they don’t say’.
	Lord Warburton asks about the niece and he is told she is the niece of his wife and she is bringing her to England. Ralph expands on this and says how his mother has been spending the winter in the United States and is expected back. Lord Warburton then asks if the girl is interesting and they tell him they hardly know more than he does, but Mrs. Touchett has described her as independent. Mr. Touchett says he hopes she is not coming to England to look for a husband: ‘So many young ladies are doing that, as if there were no good ones at home.’
	This first chapter ends with Mr. Touchett smiling and saying again to Lord Warburton not to ‘try’ on his niece and Lord Warburton says, ‘perhaps, after all, she’s not worth trying on?’
	In Chapter Two, Ralph wanders away as the other two talk and is unaware that a woman is watching him from the doorway. It is a young lady, a tall girl, in a black dress.
	When he sees her they talk and he explains who Lord Warburton is. She says she hoped there would be a Lord and adds that ‘it’s just like a novel’. Ralph notices she is lingering on the threshold and wonders if she expects his father to come over to her: ‘American girls were used to a great deal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high spirit.’ When he tells her that his father is infirm, she agrees to go to him.
	She tells Ralph that his mother is in her room and will be down for dinner at a quarter to seven. He says he cannot understand how he has never seen her on visits to the United States and she explains the disagreement there had been between his mother and her father when she was a child. He tells her he does not embrace all of his mother’s quarrels and then refers to the recent death of her father. She explains this was more than a year ago and after this his mother has been kind and proposed this trip to Europe. She blushes when he says he sees that his mother has adopted her. He feels a little alarmed and thinks he has underestimated the effect of his words. She tells him she has been taken up by her and adds that she is very fond of her liberty.
	She then goes over to her uncle and Lord Warburton tells Ralph that this is his idea of an interesting woman.
 
Analysis – Chapters One and Two
	The niece of the Touchetts is discussed in Chapter One and arrives in Chapter Two. Although not named yet, this is Isabel Archer and is the central character of the novel. She is also possibly the lady of the title, but it should be remembered that this is left somewhat ambiguous and the title has an element of irony attached.
	There is also an introduction of the theme of Americans living in Europe and the contrast between the New and Old World is drawn upon throughout the novel. The Touchetts and Isabel in particular are representative of the expatriates living in a foreign land that is careful of tradition and perhaps too mindful of protocol.
	These early stages also give an introduction to Lord Warburton and his apparent desire to find an interesting woman. He notes immediately that this young woman, who we are told is independent, fits the scope he is concerned with.

Other members of the palace include the Baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh, the head of the castle, and his overweight wife, the Baroness.  Together, the two have Cunegonde, a gorgeous seventeen-year-old princess, a son, and the esteemed palace tutor, Pangloss, who teaches that everything is for the best and that man lives in the ""best of all possible worlds.""

",Candide
98,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 3-4,"Chapter 3
Chapter 3 takes place in the midst of a giant battle between the Bulgars and the Abares.  While writing this, Voltaire was probably considering the Seven Years' War (1756-63), which was fought between the French (Abares) and the Prussians (Bulgars).  Here, Voltaire's anti-war sentiments become obvious.  Casually describing the thousands of dead soldiers on both sides, Voltaire underscores how wasteful these ""heroes"" are of human life. 
Candide, his protagonist, hides, doing his best to keep away from the needless bloodshed and ""heroic butchery."" After the battle subsides, he escapes through the battlefield, seeing the ""scattered brains and severed limbs"" that ""littered the ground."" Soon reaching the country of Holland, where he believes everyone is wealthy and Christian, he expects to be treated very well.  He stumbles across a Protestant preacher of sorts who is lecturing on the topic of charity.  Ironically, when the man sees Candide, he attacks the traveler, telling him that he doesn't deserve any bread.  Voltaire, thus, also indicts religion (particularly radical Protestantism in this chapter), which he believed was often hypocritical. 
	Luckily, a man names Jacques befriends Candide, offering him food and shelter.  Candide is elated that such fortune has found him, and he regains his confidence in Pangloss' philosophy.  All seems to be well again. 
Chapter 4
Soon thereafter, Candide takes a walk through the town when he meets a ""ghastly beggar"" who reveals to his pupil that he is Pangloss.  Candide is shocked and horrified to see his teacher in such a state, but immediately asks about his beloved Cunégonde.  When Pangloss explains that she has been killed, Candide passes out.  Upon awakening, he muses, ""Ah, best of worlds, what's become of you now?"" Obviously, Candide's belief in Pangloss' optimistic philosophy is waning, as Voltaire continues his ruthless indictment of Leibniz, Pope and others.
Pangloss, next, begins to explain the events, including the murder of Cunégonde, that occurred at the castle after Candide had been thrown out.  He says that the beautiful Cunégonde was brutally and repeatedly raped by Bulgar soldiers who attacked the family fortress, finally killing both Cunégonde and the rest of her family before destroying the castle.  Yet it seems the Abares were no less hostile to their enemies, as Pangloss notes their similar treatment of a nearby Bulgar castle.
Hearing this, Candide attempts to understand such seemingly needless suffering by asking his teacher about the ""cause and effect"" and the ""sufficient reason"" for such tragedies, specifically his own sorry state.  Pangloss masterfully crafts a brilliant explanation of his disease, which he explains was sexually transmitted from the servant girl, Paquette, to whom the reader may recall he gave ""physics lessons"" in the opening scene.  The doctor gives a detailed, yet brief account of the STD's path, explaining how it transcended through a Franciscan, and Jesuit, and even through the men of Christopher Columbus himself, who received it from the New World natives.  The devil, however, isn't at the root of such a mess, Pangloss asserts, because such suffering is only a small aspect of a larger good.  For example, if Columbus had never sailed to America, chocolate wouldn't exist to tantalize the taste buds of cultured Europeans.
	Fortunately for Pangloss, Jacques, the ""charitable anabaptist,"" pays to cure the teacher of his disease, though the philosopher loses one eye and one ear in the process.  When Jacques confronts Pangloss' systemic philosophy, however, he responds, "".private misfortunes make for public welfare.""

Traveling to Lisbon on a business trip, Jacques brings along his two philosopher friends, Candide and Pangloss.  A terrifying storm ravishes the sea during the boat trip, destroying the vessel and killing all but three of those on board-Candide, Pangloss, and a ""brutal sailor"" who survives at the expense of the kind Christian, Jacques. 
Once ashore, Candide and his mentor see the awful effects of the Lisbon earthquake, a historical natural disaster which killed over 30,000.  With Candide helping many of the surviving victims of the earthquake, Pangloss ""consoles"" the people with his doctrine of universal reason.  When an Inquisition agent asks the wise philosopher if he believes in original sin or free will, Pangloss asserts that both agree with his theory.
Chapter 6
In this chapter, Candide and Pangloss experience the auto-da-fé, a public ceremony intended to avert future disasters through a demonstration of contrition and self-degradation.  This event, like the earthquake which preceded it, actually occurred in Lisbon during the summer of 1756.
	Also connected with Candide's auto-da-fé is the Inquisition, replete with human sacrifices.  Soon Candide and Pangloss find themselves under the category of human sacrifices, having been arrested for the comical charge that one was talking and the other ""listening with an air of approval."" Though Pangloss is hanged (against auto-da-fé custom), Candide, luckily, is only flogged ""in cadence to the music."" This savage pageantry (of Candide being whipped to the beat of a beautiful song) is used by Voltaire to underscore the intolerance and injustice of the Church through its brutal treatment of innocent victims, like Candide, though it maintains the false exquisiteness of tradition.  It's interesting to note that a second earthquake struck the city only a few hours later (Obviously the auto-da-fé was not successful.).
	All this causes Candide to seriously question the optimistic way of thinking, as he seems to be approaching death before an old woman mysteriously appears to aid him.

100,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 7-8,"Chapter 7
The strange old woman takes Candide to a shanty, where she clothes and feeds him, taking general care of him for a couple of days without the young philosopher even knowing her identity.  Once he has recovered enough to see visitors, the woman leads him to a nearby house where he meets, of all people, Cunégonde. 
His lover is elated to see him, explaining that although she was close to death, she ultimately survived the attacks of the Bulgar soldiers.  Candide also relates his story, which proves quite touching to Cunégonde.
Chapter 8
Chapter 8 is Cunégonde's story-the account of her rape and her family's murder.  Becoming the prisoner-of-war of a certain, ""attractive"" Bulgar captain, she lives in a sort of quasi-bondage for three months, at which time he trades her to a wealthy Jew named Don Issachar.  When the Inquisitor sees Cunégonde at Mass, he immediately threatens the Jew, finally forcing him to agree to turn over his house and Cunégonde, his sex-slave, one-half of the week.  Yet though Cunégonde's servile status is clear, she boasts that she successfully held both of them off.
	Invited to the auto-da-fé as a spectator, Cunégonde soon notices the tutor Pangloss and her lover, Candide.  Seeing the cruelty shown them, she also begins to lose faith in the philosophy of optimism.  Cunégonde quickly instructs her maid, the old woman, to fetch Candide, which she does.
	At the end of the chapter, Don Issachar, the part-time owner of the estate, enters to ""assert his rights and express his tender passion.""
",Candide
101,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 9-10,"Chapter 9
Seeing what he believes to be another competitor for Cunégonde's love, the Jew attacks Candide, forcing the pupil of optimism to kill him with a sword.  After Issachar's death, Candide wishes that Pangloss were there to give him advice, but settles for the opinion of the old woman in his stead.  Before she can give her counsel, however, the Grand Inquisitor enters for his nightly visit, forcing Candide to kill him as well.  Quickly the old woman details the plan of their escape-that they will take what gold and diamonds they can lay their hands on, and then they should flee the estate on the backs of three horses. 
When the Holy Brotherhood, an organization with both Church and State powers, enters the household to bury their holy Inquisitor and fling Issachar onto a dunghill, the three fugitives are gone.
	In this chapter, Voltaire obviously continues his onslaught of criticism for the Catholic Church, showing the Inquisitor to be nothing more than a worldly womanizer.  He also stereotypes Don Issachar, portraying him as a greedy, selfish money-grubber who hopes to buy himself earthly happiness.

Chapter 10
 Having left an inn where they had stayed the day before, the trio soon realizes that a Franciscan friar, who was also at the inn, must have stolen their gold and diamonds.  To overcome the loss, the old woman suggests, and the others agree, that they should sell one of the horses.
	Eventually they reach Cadiz, a city on the Atlantic coast.  When Candide demonstrates the sign of the Bulgar army, he is made a captain of sorts as he, Cunégonde and the old woman begin their journey to South America.  Candide, obviously still influenced by the optimistic philosophy of his youth, comes to rest on the idea that the New World will be the ""best of all worlds.""
	Yet soon, both Candide and Cunégonde realize that the trials and tribulations of their own lives are not unique or unusual at all when the old woman tells them that their horrors pale in comparison to hers.  She then launches into a lengthy story of her life's misfortunes, making continued allusions to a missing portion of her rear end.
",Candide
102,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 11-12,"Chapter 11
In this chapter the old woman begins to narrate her own life story.  First, she explains how she was born as the bastard child of Pope Urban XX.  Next, the woman proceeds to boast about her past beauty, as well as about her handsome fiancé who suddenly dies just before their wedding. 
At another time, traveling on a papal ship of sorts, she is attacked by invading pirates who strip everyone aboard, fondling the women in the process.  It's interesting to see how Voltaire even uses this woman in his ongoing indictment of the Church.  Though the ship is supposedly defended by papal bodyguards, the old woman doesn't seem to have too high of a regard for them, as she explains the incident: ""Our soldiers defended themselves as papal troops usually do; falling on their knees and throwing down their arms..""
	Used as a personal slave by the African captain, who takes her virginity, the woman, along with her mother and chambermaids, is taken to Morocco to be sold.  When they arrive, they find themselves in the middle of a bloody civil war, which soon claims the lives of everyone except the woman.  With much effort, she manages to drag herself to a nearby stream, where she is approached by an Italian man who sees her beauty and groans about having lost his testicles.
	Voltaire, besides indicting the Roman Catholic Church, also criticizes Islam in this chapter.  The woman subtlety notes how the disciples of Muhammad scrupulously took time out of killing each other to say their five daily prayers mandated by their religion.  Other themes seen in this chapter center around war and man's cruelty to his fellow man.  Voltaire is strongly anti-war, obviously, showing it to be a needless slaughter of human life. 

Chapter 12
The old woman continues her story, as she explains how the kind man cares for her.  Soon, however, the man, who at one time worked as a court singer to the Princess of Palestrina-the woman's mother-shows he cannot be trusted.  For instead of bringing her back to Italy as he promised, he instead sells her in Algiers.  Through this ordeal, she comes down with the plague.  Though she survives, she's sold and resold as a slave to countless merchants and traders.  At one point her captors, facing starvation, even remove one of her buttocks for food.  Finally she ends up as a servant to Don Issachar, the Jew who also buys Cunégonde at a later date.  Finishing her story, she concludes with the thesis with which she began: she is the most miserable of human beings.
",Candide
103,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 13-14,"Chapter 13
 As the story returns to the present, Candide and Cunégonde agree with the woman that she has suffered more than anyone else on the ship.  Next, Candide muses to himself, oddly enough, that he wishes Pangloss were present so that he could ""politely"" object to his master's optimistic philosophy.  This brief admission is very significant, for it marks a serious change in Candide's already shifting belief in optimism.
After reaching Buenos Aires, Candide and company quickly encounter the governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueoa y Mascarenes y Campourdos y Souza.  Voltaire purposefully exaggerates his name in order to satirize the man, and the presumptuousness of the nobility in general.  It soon becomes evident that the governor, as expected, is rude and arrogant, as he aggressively pursues Cunégonde's hand in marriage after merely seeing the girl's beauty.
Startled by the sudden arrival of the police, hot on Candide's trail, the old woman urges Cunégonde to earn a life of luxury by marrying the governor.
Chapter 14
 In this chapter, the reader, for the first time, meets Cacambo, a servant/friend of sorts to Candide who has come from Spain.  Fleeing the authorities who are in the process of boarding the ship, Candide and Cacambo hurriedly flee to Paraguay, though Candide regrets having to leave his lover behind. 
	As they enter the country, Cacambo explains to Candide that Paraguay is owned and run by the Jesuits, Los Padres.  According to Camambo, Paraguay is a utopia.  Los Padres are reasonable and just, though they are at war with the Spaniards in this hemisphere and ""send them to heaven"" in Europe.  Here, obviously, Voltaire satirizes the Jesuits for their hypocritical and corrupt religious war, as they slaughter in the New World the very people they baptize and bury in the Old World.
	As Candide and his servant enter a Jesuit outpost of some kind, the guards arrest the pair, treating them almost as prisoners.  When they realize that Candide is German, however, the soldiers quickly change their tune, instead treating Candide and his friend like royalty.  Having been taken to their commander, Candide soon realizes that this man is the baron's son, Cun�gonde's brother, who was reportedly killed by the Bulgars.
",Candide
104,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 15-16,"Chapter 15
The commander, Cunégonde's brother, also referred to by Voltaire as the baron, explains to Candide the events following the Bulgar invasion.  Though his parents were killed and his sister raped, he was befriended by a Jesuit priest, who sent him to Rome, and eventually to Paraguay, letting him serve both the church and the state as a colonel and priest.
Candide and the baron seem to be getting along fine until Candide mentions his desire to marry Cunégonde.  Hearing this, the commander immediately scoffs and even threatens the young philosopher, and a sword fight quickly ensues.  Candide kills his future brother-in-law, and Cacambo, waiting nearby, organizes a fast escape for himself and his master.
	 
Chapter 16
Volaire's 16th chapter is definitely one of his most interesting.  Now in the wilderness of South America, Candide and Cacambo hear the screams of two young women nearby.  Investigating further, they realize that two monkeys are chasing the girls, who run naked.  Lifting his rifle, Candide kills both animals, believing that he has saved the two young girls.  Shocked, he sees the girls turn around, coming back to embrace the monkeys with whom they had frolicked.  Cacambo tries to explain all of this to his master, saying that these women are ignorant of the reason of Europe, and thus engage in the irrational, carnal pleasures of life. 
	Waking up from their sleep a few hours later, Candide and his valet find themselves tied with vines and surrounded by forest natives called Biglugs (Orejones in Spanish).  Apparently the two girls had told their people about the shooting of their lovers, and these Indians found the culprits as they slept. 
	Luckily, the shrewd Cacambo, who even knows some of the local language, speaks to the captors brilliantly about how he and his master are not their Jesuit enemies, but indeed friends.  Hearing this, the natives release their two prisoners, wishing them well.  Candide is elated that his life is spared, even asserting that these people, uncorrupted by civilization, are the best people in the world.  This theory that nature is utopian was taught to him earlier by Pangloss.

105,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 17-18,"Chapter 17
 In this chapter the reader is introduced to the most genuine description of utopia in the novel-Eldorado.  Letting a river guide them, they accidentally (or perhaps providentially) end up in the land of gold and jewels.  Candide thinks to himself that surely this is the best of all possible worlds, as his teacher always said really did exist.
Chapter 18
 Having been taken to an old man's home, Candide and Cacambo are told the history of El Dorado, which was at one time part of the Inca empire.  Soon they begin discussing religion, and Candide is relieved to know that the people of this land worship a single deity.  Though they don't pray to this god (since there's nothing for which to pray), they do thank Him in everything they do.  Everyone is a priest, the man explains; there is no need for monks or other church officials since this world is a utopia.
	Tooled with several red sheep to haul their carriage, Candide and his servant go to the king's castle.  Touring the capital, they realize that there are no government institutions, no prisons and no need for lawyers. 
	Having spent a month in this place, both Candide and his friend being to grow restless, and Candide in particular greatly misses his lovely Cungonde.  The two, thus, make plans to leave the place, taking with them enough golden pebbles to make them the richest men alive in their former world.

106,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 19-20,"Chapter 19
Having left Eldorado, Candide and Cacambo begin their journey back to Europe.  After several days into their long trek have passed, however, they have lost all but two of their sheep.  Seeing an abused African slave stretched out on the road before them, the two question him, and learn that a very religious Christian man is his master.  Hearing this, Candide admits to himself, ""I'm through, I must give up [Pangloss'] optimism after all... It is a mania for saying things are well when one is in hell.""
Next, Candide and Cacambo agree to split up, with Candide deciding to wait in Venice for Camabo, who agrees to return to Buenos Aires to bribe the governor to hand over Cunégonde.  Unfortunately for Candide, a sly merchant steals two of his diamonds.  Angry and dejected, Candide tries to get the authorities involved, but they are less than helpful or polite.  Soon he resolves to himself that if there is a place where everything is for the best, ""it is in Eldorado and not in the rest of the world.""
	Wanting a companion for his voyage, he asks a few nearby people if they wish to travel with him in exchange for lodging and money.  Wanting to reward the most unlucky applicant, Candide finally selects a scholar who seems to have had a horrible lot in life.
Chapter 20
The scholar, named Martin, who Voltaire explains is very learned in the area of identifying moral evil, and Candide, who is also quite practiced in the art, begin their journey.  Despite his experience, Voltaire admits that his protagonist still subscribes to optimism, since he still has hope of one day seeing Cunégonde. 
	Talking philosophy with his new valet, Candide learns that Martin is a Manichee, a believer in a world with almost equal amounts of good and evil.  He sums up his philosophy, saying, ""In a word, I have seen so much and suffered so much, that I am a Manichee.""
	Outside they see two warring ships, one of which sinks.  Eventually Candide learns, when a red sheep floats to the surface, that the sunken ship carried his stolen treasure.  Candide tries to use this event to his advantage in his argument with Martin, asserting that the thief received his just reward.  Martin, however, astutely points out that many innocent people also died when the ship went down.
",Candide
107,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 21-22,"Chapter 21
 Finally, Candide and Martin reach France.  It soon becomes obvious to the reader that Martin has a very little regard for Paris social society, as he describes its inhabitants as a mob, always seeking pleasure but never finding it. 
Candide, sensing Martin's distaste for the country, explains that he doesn't want to stay long himself, but simply plans to use France as a way to get to Venice, where he will wait for his beloved Cunégonde. 
Martin seems to be very disillusioned with life, saying that he's seen it all.  When Candide asks him if he believes men have always been evil, Martin responds in the affirmative, comparing humans to hawks-species which live by instinct.  Candide tries to refute his argument, however, asserting that man has free will.

Chapter 22
 Candide decides to visit Paris while he and Martin pass through France.  While staying in a hotel, all of those around Candide try to take advantage of him, hoping to siphon off some of his wealth.  They cheat him at cards, seduce him, and even pretend to be Cunégonde herself (of course a very sick, mute Cunégonde who cannot be exposed to light), in order to exhort his money-and each scheme is very successful.  Later, they see a play at the theater and one of the actresses in the production reminds Candide of Cunégonde.  Next, being entertained at a home where he meets a wise man, Candide immediately asks him if he subscribes to Pangloss' philosophy of optimism.  The man says he doesn't, maintaining that ""everything goes wrong in our world.."" Candide responds by repeating Pangloss' teaching that ""troubles are just the shadows in a beautiful picture."" At this point, however, Martin asserts that ""the shadows are horrible ugly blots.""
Later, though he feels guilty about it afterwards, Candide is unfaithful to Cunégonde with the ""lady"" of the household, who simply wanted (and received) his diamonds.  Eventually, Candide grows fed up with the scheming which surrounds him, so he tells Martin that they must escape from this ""hell."" Though not yet going towards Venice, Candide is happy enough just to get to England.
",Candide
108,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 23-24,"Chapter 23: Now on the way to England, Martin explains to Candide the characteristics of the English.  He says that though the English may be less crazy than the French (who they have been at war with for years over ""a few acres of snow near Canada.""), they are more prone to depression.  Nearing the harbor, both men witness the execution of an English admiral who ""didn't kill enough [French].""
	Hearing this, Candide is taken aback and consequently refuses to set foot on English soil, instead arranging for his passage directly to Venice.  Finally reaching Venice a few days later, Candide resurrects a lesser version of Pangloss' optimism, saying, ""all goes as well as possible.""
	Chapter 24: Now in Venice, Candide makes his first priority to find Cacambo, hoping that he has brought Cunegonde.  After a few days of fruitless searching, he grows despairing, finally resolving to Martin that Cunegonde is dead, that ""all is but illusion and disaster.""
	Turning a moment from his deep sadness, Candide sees a monk and a prostitute walking down the street, arm in arm.  Candide bets Martin that the couple is happy.  After he invites them to dinner, Candide realizes that the young girl is Paquette, the maidservant to his old baroness and the woman who gave Pangloss the STD.  Quickly she fills Candide in on the miseries of her own life.  The monk also explains how he is quite unhappy with his lot in life.  After hearing all of this, Candide is forced to admit that Martin has won the bet. 
	After giving both Paquette and the monk some money, Candide begins to arrange for his and Martin's next meeting: a meeting with Senator Pocourante, apparently ""a man who has never known a moment's grief.""
",Candide

Chapter 25: Now inside the senator's home, Candide and Martin find that the man is not at all satisfied with his life or his many possessions, but is constantly critical or cynical about all that he has.  For example, his paintings by Rafael don't please him, Homer bores him and he finds neither the writing of Virgil, Horace or Milton very great. 
	Later, when Candide and Martin discuss their visit alone, Candide tries to salvage his premise that Pocourante is the happiest of all men, saying that there must be some kind of pleasure in ""seeing faults where other people think they see beauties."" Yet when Martin challenges his thesis, Candide admits that perhaps only he himself is optimistic at the prospect of again seeing Cunegonde.
	Chapter 26: While Candide is waiting in his hotel for dinner to be served, Cacambo, serving as a waiter, reveals himself to his old friend, saying that he is a slave now and that Cunegonde isn't with him, but is staying in Constantinople.  Cacambo tells Candide that he has arranged for a ship to take him to his lover.  This is the main plot development of the chapter, though an interesting side note to the story is the account of the six kings who are dining with Candide and Martin.  Apparently even the royalty cannot escape the miseries of life, as they reveal their identities to Candide and to each other, explaining the horrible fortunes which have befallen them.

 Now boarding the ship, the relentless Candide again tries to resurrect Pangloss' optimism in front of Martin, asserting that since his circumstances might be worse, all must be for the best.  Martin, of course, is skeptical.
Next speaking to Cacambo, Candide learns that Cunégonde too is a slave, working as a dishwasher, and ugly to boot.  Candide, however, says that he doesn't care what she looks like, as long as he can see her again.
	Walking about on ship, Candide spies two convicts who bear a remarkable resemblance to Cunégonde's brother, the baron, and Dr. Pangloss, both thought to be dead.  Getting closer, he realizes that indeed it is them, alive, though not well.  Motioning to the captain, Candide arranges to pay for their release.

Chapter 28
Both the baron and Pangloss explain the circumstances which led to them escaping death. Cunégonde's brother says that he was healed of the sword wound inflicted upon him by Candide.  Pangloss explains how he narrowly escaped hanging, thanks to a knot that stopped the rope from completely suffocating him.  Both men, however, get into trouble (the baron by swimming with an Arab, Pangloss by fondling a young women in a mosque), resulting in their arrest and subsequent captivity.
	Nevertheless, the philosopher still maintains his belief in deterministic optimism, asserting, ""I am a philosopher, and it would not be right for me to recant since Leibniz could not possibly be wrong.""

Summary
	The story opens at the opera in New York. In the audience is the novel's protagonist, Newland Archer, a cultured young man from the city's fashionable 'old money' society. Archer sees the girl he is to marry, May Welland, sitting in the box of the matriarch of her family, old Mrs Catherine Manson Mingott.
	Mrs Mingott herself is too obese to attend. She is a respected figure in New York society, due to her indomitable nature and the impeccable decency of her life.
	Archer reflects ardently on the innocence of his fiancee, and looks forward to educating her. Conversely, he would also like her to be as worldly-wise as his former married lover.
	Also at the opera are Lawrence Lefferts, the foremost authority on form in New York, and Sillerton Jackson, an expert on society scandals. Lefferts is shocked to see Countess Ellen Olenska, May's cousin, in the Mingotts' box. Ellen has returned from Europe, where she was living with her philandering husband, a Polish Count. She has left him - an act unacceptable to the high society of the time - and reportedly had an affair with his secretary. Such is the disgrace into which Ellen has fallen that even Newland Archer, who approves of the Mingotts' private support for her, is disturbed at their publicly introducing her into their opera box. After all, this is the same box in which his wife-to-be is sitting. Their engagement is to be announced in a few weeks.
	Archer decides that he must act to restore dignity to May's family and to help her through the ordeal. He visits their box and suggests to May that he should bring forward the announcement of their engagement to that night, at the Beauforts' ball.
	Archer is introduced to Ellen. She recalls that they used to play together as children and that he was a ""horrid boy"" who kissed her behind a door. Archer is shocked at her disrespect for the fashionable society which is effectively her judge.
	Julius and Regina Beaufort hold an annual ball in a room kept only for that purpose, a luxury which ""was felt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past"" (Chapter 3, p. 16). Beaufort was a banker in his native England before he left amid rumors of shady financial dealings.
	When Archer arrives at the ball, he sees that May is announcing their engagement to her circle. She asks him if he has told Ellen of their engagement. He has been reluctant to speak of it to her, but tells May falsely that he has not had the chance. May urges him to do so, since Ellen is feeling sensitive and May does not want her to feel forgotten. Archer agrees to tell Ellen, but May says that she has not come to the ball, deciding at the last minute that her dress was not smart enough. Archer knows that the real reason Ellen has stayed away is shame at her reputation, but he admires May's determination to ""ignore the unpleasant"" in refraining from mentioning this. He in turn does not show May that he knows what lies behind Ellen's absence.
	Analysis
	It is significant that the novel opens at the opera. This introduces one of the recurring metaphors of the novel: that of performance, or keeping up an appearance of correct and moral behavior, whatever the reality might be. Repeatedly in this novel we encounter characters who behave badly but are welcome in New York society because they are discreet. (Julius Beaufort is an example.) The minute the facade slips and their offences against morality or taste become public knowledge, they are punished or even ostracized.
	Wharton conveys the ease with which the unwary or unschooled can slip into the many social pitfalls: "". in metropolises it was 'not the thing' to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not 'the thing' played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the inscrutable totem errors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago."" (Chapter 1, p. 4)
	Newland Archer is disconcerted by Ellen Olenska's appearance in the Mingotts' opera box because it is an offence against taste. While Ellen put up with her unhappy marriage, she was accepted, but when she left her husband with his secretary, her public offence against morality placed her beyond the pale of respectability. Ellen's disregard for the conventions of society becomes obvious in her first conversation with Archer. Instead of showing a fitting humility and seriousness before her high society judges (of whom Archer is a representative), she paints an undignified - but very human - picture of him and herself as children. Archer cannot tell Ellen about his engagement to May, a sign that the two inhabit two different worlds that Archer will fail to reconcile.
	May Welland, seen through Archer's eyes, provides a contrast to Ellen. Her innocence is symbolized throughout the novel by the lilies-of-the-valley that form her bouquets. The lily-of-the-valley is a white flower which traditionally connotes purity and chastity. Archer feels happy at the thought that in her innocence, she does not even understand the seduction scene in the opera. Clearly, an innocence that depends on emotional ignorance is unlikely to stand up to the hardships of the real world.
	Another theme introduced in these chapters is the contrast between the strict adherence to accepted morality in New York, embodied in May, and what is seen as the moral ambiguities of old Europe, embodied in Ellen.
	New York high society, with its complex system of manners and mores, is the constant reference point against which most of the characters view themselves. They act to please society rather than themselves, in order to preserve the smooth running of the community. A tension is set up between the individual and society, and in the case of Ellen, that tension has been stretched almost to breaking point. She, uniquely at this point in the novel, has acted to please herself and earned the disapproval of her community. The implicit question is how this tension will be resolved: will she bend to society's dictates for the sake of a quiet life, or will she continue to carve her own destiny?
	One way in which Wharton conveys the hypocrisy of society is by having characters refrain from saying what they truly think. Both Archer and May know the real reason why Ellen did not go to the ball at the Beauforts', but they keep up the pretence, even to each other, that it is because she didn't have a suitable dress. Archer admires May's ability to ""carry to the utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the 'unpleasant' in which they had both been brought up"" (Chapter 3, p. 22). Again, a tension is created, in this case between what characters know to be reality and what they pretend or express. We feel that this is a tenuous state that cannot sustain itself, and wait in suspense for the cracks to appear.

Ellen's disregard for the conventions of society becomes obvious in her first conversation with Archer. Instead of showing a fitting humility and seriousness before her high society judges (of whom Archer is a representative), she paints an undignified - but very human - picture of him and herself as children. Archer cannot tell Ellen about his engagement to May, a sign that the two inhabit two different worlds that Archer will fail to reconcile.
	May Welland, seen through Archer's eyes, provides a contrast to Ellen. Her innocence is symbolized throughout the novel by the lilies-of-the-valley that form her bouquets. The lily-of-the-valley is a white flower which traditionally connotes purity and chastity. Archer feels happy at the thought that in her innocence, she does not even understand the seduction scene in the opera. Clearly, an innocence that depends on emotional ignorance is unlikely to stand up to the hardships of the real world.
	Another theme introduced in these chapters is the contrast between the strict adherence to accepted morality in New York, embodied in May, and what is seen as the moral ambiguities of old Europe, embodied in Ellen.
	New York high society, with its complex system of manners and mores, is the constant reference point against which most of the characters view themselves. They act to please society rather than themselves, in order to preserve the smooth running of the community. A tension is set up between the individual and society, and in the case of Ellen, that tension has been stretched almost to breaking point. She, uniquely at this point in the novel, has acted to please herself and earned the disapproval of her community. The implicit question is how this tension will be resolved: will she bend to society's dictates for the sake of a quiet life, or will she continue to carve her own destiny?
	One way in which Wharton conveys the hypocrisy of society is by having characters refrain from saying what they truly think. Both Archer and May know the real reason why Ellen did not go to the ball at the Beauforts', but they keep up the pretence, even to each other, that it is because she didn't have a suitable dress. Archer admires May's ability to ""carry to the utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the 'unpleasant' in which they had both been brought up"" (Chapter 3, p. 22). Again, a tension is created, in this case between what characters know to be reality and what they pretend or express. We feel that this is a tenuous state that cannot sustain itself, and wait in suspense for the cracks to appear.

113,The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 4-6,"Chapters 4-6
Summary
	Archer and May begin their round of betrothal visits by calling on May's family matriarch, Catherine Manson Mingott, at her home. Mrs Mingott cannot go upstairs because of her obesity, and has arranged her sitting room on the ground floor, with her bedroom in full view of guests. This shockingly recalls ""scenes in French fiction, and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed of. That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies. ."" It amuses Archer to think of ""her blameless life led in the stage-setting of adultery"" (Chapter 4, p. 24).
	To everyone's relief, Ellen Olenska is not present when the betrothed couple arrive. Mrs Mingott gives the couple her blessing and asks when the wedding will be. Mrs Welland offers a show of reluctance to hurry it. Ellen enters with Julius Beaufort. Archer tells her about the engagement, which she already knows of. As she bids him goodbye, she asks him to come and visit her.
	After the Wellands leave, they discuss the occasion, taking care not to mention Ellen. But Archer knows that Mrs Welland disapproves of Ellen's being seen out walking with Beaufort, and also feels that Ellen should know that a recently engaged man does not call on married women. He is glad that he is to marry ""one of his own kind.""
	Archer's mother, Mrs Archer, is shy but likes to know what is going on in society, so she invites the expert, Sillerton Jackson, to dinner. The unspoken implication is that she wants to know about Ellen. Archer is at the dinner, as is his sister Janey.
	Eventually, after pretending to be interested in other topics of conversation, Mrs Archer asks Sillerton if Ellen was at the Beauforts' ball, and Sillerton replies that she was not. They discuss her in patronizing terms, Mrs Archer remarking that little can be expected of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming-out ball (presumably, a more demure color and fabric would be more fitting).
	During the discussion about Ellen that follows, Archer defends her actions against the disapproving company. He defends her right to be conspicuous if she wishes, applauds the secretary for helping her escape from her husband, and hopes that she gets a divorce (divorce was an unusual and stigmatizing action at this time).
	After dinner, Archer and Sillerton retire to the library. Sillerton tells Archer that the secretary did not merely help Ellen, but was living with her a year later in Lausanne, Switzerland. Archer is embarrassed but continues to stand up for Ellen, defending her right to make her life anew with whoever she pleases, especially since her husband preferred to live with harlots. ""Women ought to be free - as free as we are,"" he says, condemning the double standard prevalent at the time that allowed men, but not women, to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. Sillerton comments that Count Olenski evidently agrees with Archer, since he has not tried to get his wife back.
	Archer reflects on the case of the unconventional Ellen and his approaching marriage to the traditional May, ""that terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything."" Now that his settled convictions have been shaken up by Ellen's story, May seems like a stranger, and marriage no longer a ""safe anchorage"" but ""a voyage on uncharted seas"" (Chapter 6, p. 36).
	The author undermines Archer's championing of the freedom of women by commenting that, from his point of view, "" 'Nice' women, however wronged, would never claim the kind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were therefore - in the heat of argument - the more ready to concede it to them."" (Chapter 6, p. 37)
	However, it is clear that Archer is questioning the convention whereby out of decency, men were expected to conceal their past from their wives-to-be, and women were not allowed to have any past at all: what could he and May really know of each other? He worries that his marriage might become what most other marriages around him were: ""a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on one side and hypocrisy on the other."" (Chapter 6, p. 37) An example is Lawrence Lefferts, whose well-trained wife averts her gaze indignantly when someone mentions Julius Beaufort's maintaining a mistress and yet turns a blind eye to her husband's love affairs.
	Archer is also questioning the value of May's innocence, which he now views as oppressive, a creation ""manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to be what he wanted."" (Chapter 6, p. 39). His doubts have been prompted by the case of Ellen.
	Mrs Lovell Mingott sends out invitations ""To meet the Countess Olenska."" However, everyone refuses, except the Beauforts and Sillerton Jackson. Ellen has been snubbed. Archer is outraged. Mrs Archer intervenes by going to see Louisa van der Luyden, whose family, descended from Dutch aristocracy, stands at the head of New York society. She says that she is doing this for May's sake and for the sake of society (not, it seems, for Ellen's sake, who seems the one most in need of help).
	Analysis
	Because of Mrs Mingott's powerful place in New York society and her blameless life, she is able to transgress some of the forms of correctness, such as having her bedroom in full view of guests. She feels a kinship with Julius Beaufort, since both possess an ability to take ""short-cuts through the conventions"" (Chapter 4, p. 26)
	Ellen shocks Archer with her ignorance or carelessness of convention in inviting him to call on her, a married woman. He prides himself on his cosmopolitan views, but is glad that he is allying himself to ""one of his own kind,"" May Welland.
	Mrs Archer and her daughter know all about Julius Beaufort's shady history, but they avoid talking about it openly. The Beauforts are, however, accepted and even courted because the scandal is not in public view, illustrating the extreme hypocrisy of fashionable society. Nevertheless, Mrs Archer, born into 'old money' and 'good family', believes Beaufort to be vulgar.
	The theme of hypocrisy, in the sense of hiding one's true thoughts and feelings under a system of codes, continues in the narrator's comment on Mrs Archer and her son: "". it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts"" (Chapter 5, p. 32).
	We see a new and refreshing side of Archer when this young man, who has thus far appeared rather conventional, condemns the double standard prevalent in society at the time that allowed men, but not women, the freedom to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. However, the narrator points out dryly that he has not thought through the implications of his progressive view, perhaps with regard to his own traditional marriage. The author goes on to undermine Archer's championing of women's freedom as ""humbugging disguise"" (Chapter 6, p. 37), as, from his point of view, 'nice' women would not claim the kind of freedom he meant, and thus generous-minded men like himself were the more ready to concede it to them.
	But Ellen's case has stirred up his old settled convictions, so that marriage seems less like a ""safe anchorage"" than ""a voyage on uncharted seas,"" and May, the traditional girl who ""knew nothing and expected everything,"" now seems disconcertingly like a stranger.
	The narrator uses Archer's reflection on the falseness of most marriages to make an observation on the hypocrisy of New York society that could stand as emblematic of The Age of Innocence: ""In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs."" (Chapter 6, p. 38). An example is Mrs Archer's pretence of reluctance at bringing forward the announcement of the engagement, when, in fact, she is eager to see the marriage happen soon.
	Archer's new vision of May's innocence as a product carefully manufactured by relatives casts an ironic light on the novel's title. Through Archer, Wharton seems to ask, what is the value of the 'innocence' that girls aspire to and which men are supposed to want in a wife? Wharton's own answer, given through Archer's point of view, seems clear: ""He could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the Babes in the Wood."" (Chapter 6, p. 39).
",The Age of Innocence
114,The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 7-9,"Chapters 7-9
Summary
	Mrs Archer and her son call on the van der Luydens to ask for their help in the case of the snubbing of Ellen. The Archers believe that the snubbing has been orchestrated by Lawrence Lefferts to divert attention from his own illicit affair.
	The van der Luydens agree to support Ellen, who is a relative of theirs. Henry van der Luyden says that Mrs van der Luyden's aristocratic relative, the Duke of St Austrey, is coming to visit next week. The van der Luydens will invite Ellen to join them and their other guests.
	Chapter 8 tells us something of Ellen's background. She was the pretty daughter of ""continental wanderers,"" and had traveled with them until she was orphaned. Thereafter she was brought up by her aunt, Medora Manson, another wanderer. Medora was repeatedly widowed and would return to New York to settle down, each time to a less expensive house, suggesting that her fortunes were diminishing. New York society considered her eccentric and tolerated her only for her family connections.
	Ellen was taken to Italy by her aunt, Mrs Thorley Chivers, and became proficient in such barely respectable arts as Spanish dancing, drawing live models, and playing the piano with professional musicians. She later married a rich Polish count. A few years later, Medora again returned to New York, looking for a yet cheaper house. Soon, news arrived that Ellen's marriage had ended disastrously and that she too was returning to New York.
	Archer sees Ellen at the van der Luydens' dinner for the Duke of St Austrey. The Duke, a shabbily dressed, unassuming man who nevertheless commands great respect by dint of his ""credentials,"" goes to sit next to Ellen and talks with her.
	Later, Ellen rises and goes to sit next to Archer - a breach of the custom which requires a woman to sit immobile and converse with any man who decides to approach her. Ellen shocks Archer by calling the Duke dull and asking if Archer's coming marriage was arranged. She is embarrassed by her mistake, which was prompted by her experience of Europe, and says she wants to forget her past and become a complete American again, like the Mingotts and Wellands.
	May arrives, but Archer stays next to Ellen. Others who had refused to meet Ellen at Mrs Lovell Mingott's house now talk with her, including the Leffertses. Ellen invites Archer to visit her the next day, and he agrees.
	The next day, Archer spends the day making more betrothal visits at the insistence of May's mother. He had wanted also to bring forward the wedding, planned for the following autumn, but Mrs Welland had refused because of the preparations.
	Archer calls on Ellen at her house, in a district of writers and artisans. He has not told May of this visit but excuses himself with the thought that he is obeying May's request to be kind to her cousin. Ellen is out when he arrives, so he is invited by the foreign maid into the drawing-room. He has time to look around the room, which feels like an adventure to him. There are Italian paintings the like of which he has never seen, and an exotic fragrance.
	Archer contrasts Ellen's house with the house that Mr Welland has his eye on for the newly-weds, newly built of a ghastly greenish-yellow stone. Archer would like to travel, but though the Wellands approve of an extended honeymoon in Europe, the couple will be expected to return to this house. He expects that May will decorate it in the pretentious style of her parents' house. He feels as if ""his fate was sealed""(Chapter 9, p. 61).
	Ellen arrives in Julius Beaufort's carriage. Beaufort had taken her to see some other houses, since the one she is living in is not in a fashionable street. Ellen first says that she wants to make her own fashions, but then contradicts herself by saying she has lived too independently, and now wants to do what everyone else does, to feel cared for and safe.
	Ellen asks Archer to help her understand the things she needs to know to survive socially. She says she counts him and Beaufort as her interpreters. Archer hates being linked with Beaufort.
	Archer tells Ellen to stay close to the older society women, as they wish to help her. Ellen replies that they wish to help as long as they don't hear anything unpleasant, and says, ""The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!"" She bursts into tears. Archer comforts her.
	The Duke of St Austrey arrives with a friend, Mrs Struthers, who, being seen as common, was not invited to the van der Luydens' but who wants to meet Ellen. Neither Ellen nor the Duke realize what a liberty he is taking in bringing the lady uninvited. Mrs Struthers invites Ellen and (as she assumes) her ""young man,"" Archer, to hear a famous pianist play at her house the next day. Ellen accepts. Archer leaves, and buys May the box of lilies-of-the-valley that he sends her daily. When he goes to the flower shop, he sees some bright yellow roses. He sends the roses to Ellen, without any indication of who they are from.
	Analysis
	The hypocrisy of New York society is emphasized by the eagerness of the Leffertses and other families who had declined to meet Ellen at Mrs Lovell Mingott's, to pay their respects to her now that she has been welcomed by the powerful van der Luydens.
	Wharton throws an ironic light on the book's title, as Archer, paraded about by Mrs Welland on endless betrothal visits, feels he is being ""shown off like a wild animal cunningly trapped"" (Chapter 9, p. 58). There is nothing innocent about this carefully contrived process.
	Ellen's house, shabby yet beautiful, full of exotic foreign paintings and fragrances, is contrasted with the house that Mr Welland plans for Archer and May - emphasizing the difference between the two women. It is newly-built of a ghastly greenish-yellow stone with a Pompeian-style vestibule. Archer imagines that May will decorate it like her parents' house, a thought which makes him feel ""that his fate was sealed"" (Chapter 9, p. 61) - again, an image of being trapped.
	Ellen's comment that being in New York is like ""being taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all one's lessons"" (Chapter 9, p. 63) reveals the conventional nature of society. In contrast to this conformity is set Ellen's careless disregard for convention. Ellen's upbringing, with its flaunting of convention, foreshadows her unconventional adulthood. Her life with the Count is viewed as disappearing into ""a kind of sulphurous apotheosis"" (Chapter 8, p. 51) - sulphur, of course, being the gas of hell. Ellen's childhood propensity for asking disconcerting questions has not deserted her: she asks Archer directly if he loves May and whether the marriage was arranged.
	Archer's increasing fascination with Ellen is betrayed by his forgetting to send May his usual box of lilies-of-the-valley. On impulse, he sends golden yellow roses to Ellen. The two different flowers, the one white, pure and chaste, the other rich, strong and fiery, symbolize the gulf between the two women, the different feelings they inspire in Archer, and the choice facing him.
",The Age of Innocence
115,The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 10-12,"Chapters 10-12
Summary
	Archer tells May about his having sent roses to Ellen, though not about his visit to her; she approves of his kind gesture, but finds it odd that Ellen did not mention it.
	Archer is not happy about the long engagement, since he wants them to travel together as soon as possible, but May accepts it because her mother would not understand them wanting to do things differently. He is impatient at the seeming inability of 'nice' women to speak for themselves, but concedes that society does not encourage them to do so. He wonders if, when he removes the ""bandage"" of innocence from her eyes, she will be able to see, or whether she will be like the Kentucky cave-fish, which ceased to develop eyes because it had no use for them.
	He observes that he and May and others of the same class are ""all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper."" He asks her why he and she cannot strike out on their own. She suggests it would be ""vulgar."" He questions why she should fear this so much; she points out that he would not like it any more than she would.
	At his office, Archer begins to feel trapped by the day-to-day sameness of his job as a lawyer. His colleagues, he thinks, are discussing the Duke and the scandalous appearance of one of Julius Beaufort's mistresses driving her own carriage on Fifth Avenue. Archer's sister Janey comes in, angry that Ellen has been to Mrs Struthers' party, and Archer didn't try to stop her for the sake of the family honor. The van der Luydens are, she says, so offended that they are going to Skuytercliff, their country estate.
	Mrs Archer is incredulous that Archer is unrepentant at having upset the van der Luydens. Archer defends all those blamed for the offence - himself, Ellen and lastly, Mrs Struthers, who he says is amusing and offers good music. Mrs Archer wants her son to explain to the van der Luydens that Ellen comes from a different society. Archer says that he is not responsible; the culprit, if any, is the Duke, who introduced Mrs Struthers to Ellen and took Ellen to her party. But Mrs Archer says that the Duke is a guest and a stranger, whereas Ellen is a New Yorker ""and should have respected the feelings of New York.""
	Henry van der Luyden calls on the Archers. Henry talks appreciatively of Ellen's charm and artistic ability. But after hearing from Sillerton Jackson of her visit to Mrs Struthers, he has warned her about going to such parties.
	Mr Letterblair, head of the law firm where Archer works, tells him that members of May's family, including Mrs Mingott, Lovell Mingott and Mr Welland, have asked for Archer's advice on Ellen's wish to divorce her husband. The family does not want the divorce, but Ellen is insisting on a legal opinion. Archer reluctantly agrees to look at the case. He compares Ellen unfavorably with May, who would never hawk about her problems in this way.
	Archer reads letters between the Count and Ellen. In a fit of pity mixed with disgust, he agrees to see Ellen about the case. Archer has been conditioned to believe that men who have illicit love affairs are only foolish, whereas women who do so are criminal. But he now begins to question whether ""complicated"" European societies might produce less simple problems. Perhaps a woman might be drawn into such a situation through defenselessness and loneliness.
	He writes to Ellen asking when they might discuss the divorce, but she replies that she is going to the van der Luyden's estate, Skuytercliff, but could see him that Sunday. Archer dines with Letterblair, who agrees with the family that a divorce is unacceptable. Archer feels that Ellen is justified in wanting a divorce, but Letterblair pressures him into using his influence against the idea, in order to avoid marrying into a family with a scandalous divorce hanging over it.
	Archer says he would rather not give an opinion until he hears what Ellen has to say. He goes to the writers' and artists' quarter where she lives. Such people are unacceptable in New York society, though in other parts of the world they are feted. Archer knows most of them. One, the journalist Ned Winsett, is a friend.
	Ellen's maid, Nastasia, opens the door. Archer is angry when he sees Julius Beaufort's coat in the hall. Ellen is talking to Beaufort and, flaunting the dinner dress convention, is wearing a red velvet robe trimmed with black fur. Beaufort says it is a pity she is going away as he intended to invite her to a musical evening.
	Ellen dismisses Beaufort so that she can discuss business with Archer. She tells Archer that she is trying not to care so much about the arts, as part of her attempt to cast off her old life and become like everybody else. Turning to her divorce, she tells him that she wants to be free and feels that she is justified in this desire by Count Olenski's ""abominable"" behavior. But Archer warns her that if he contests the divorce, unpleasant things may be said about her which may harm her. She will gain nothing in return. She protests that her freedom is not ""nothing."" But he points out that the individual is, by custom, sacrificed to the collective interest. She unhappily agrees to do as he wishes.
	Analysis
	The schism between Archer and May grows, as is shown by his impatience with her acceptance of the long engagement and her inability to think independently. The comparison between the unworldly May and the Kentucky cave-fish, whose eyes had ceased to develop because it had no use for them, says much about Wharton's attitude to society's expectations of women. They were expected to be ignorant of worldly things. Archer's fear that there will be nothing of value under May's innocence is expressed in this sinister image: ""What if, when he had bidden May Welland to open [her eyes], they could only look out blankly at blankness?"" (Chapter 10, p. 70) The extent to which Archer is changing in his attitudes is evident from the contrast between this image and his paternalistic delight in May's innocence in the first chapter.
	Archer's musings reflect Wharton's own interest in feminist ideas. To what extent, she asks, can an individual, particularly a woman, carve out their own fate, and to what extent must they accept the fate that is approved by society? In Chapter 11, Wharton bitterly notes the double standards that apply in illicit love affairs: the man is seen, especially by other women, as merely foolish, the woman criminal.
	A gulf is growing between Ellen and the New York society she hopes to join. Ellen, in an attempt to fit in, is trying to become just like everybody else by caring less about the arts, which New York society does not value. But the van der Luydens are upset that she has gone to a party held by the ""common"" Mrs Struthers, and Mrs Archer and Janey are upset because the van der Luydens are upset.
	Archer's talk with Ellen about her divorce is a testing ground for where he stands in the conflict between the individual and society. Though privately he supports Ellen in her desire to be free, when he talks with her, he comes down firmly on the side of doing as society demands and not pursuing the divorce. His advice is to help seal his own and Ellen's fates.
",The Age of Innocence
116,The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 13-15,"Chapters 13-15
Summary
	At the theatre, Archer is moved by an incident in the play. The leading man and lady sadly bid each other goodbye. The lady leans on the mantelpiece and buries her face in her hands. Unnoticed by her, her lover approaches and kisses the ribbon that hangs down her back before he leaves. She never knows this. Archer is reminded of his leave-taking from Ellen.
	Archer thinks that Count Olenski is correct in believing that Ellen and the secretary were lovers. He understands that she may have been prompted to this by gratefulness to her rescuer, but he also knows that these same actions would, in the eyes of the world, make her no better than her husband.
	The Welland-Mingott family is delighted that Archer has talked Ellen out of the divorce. Mrs Mingott believes it is better to be a married woman and a Countess than plain Ellen Mingott and an old maid.
	In the theatre, Archer visits Ellen in the Beauforts' box. Ellen asks Archer if the lover in the play will send his lady a bunch of yellow roses in the morning - a reference to his own gifts to her. Archer is embarrassed but pleased that she associates his gifts with the tender scene in the play. He admits that he was going to leave the theatre then so as to take the picture with him. She asks what he does when May is away (the Wellands have gone to St Augustine). He works, he says. She tells him that she thinks he was right about the divorce, and she is following his advice.
	As he is leaving the theatre, Archer runs into his journalist friend, Ned Winsett. Ned noticed Ellen in Beaufort's box and asks Archer who she is. She lives near Ned and rescued his son, who had fallen and cut himself. Ned is amazed that a Countess should live in his area, but Archer says she does not care where she lives, ""or about any of our little social sign-posts"" (Chapter 14, p. 104). Winsett too has only contempt for such things.
	Winsett is not a journalist by choice; he is a literary man, but could not make money from it. He advises Archer to enter politics, to ""roll up your sleeves and get right down into the muck,"" in order to avoid the otherwise inevitable fate of his entire class - being ""like the pictures on the walls of a deserted house"" (Chapter 14, p. 106). But Archer believes that a gentleman could not go into politics.
	Next morning, Archer looks in vain for yellow roses to send to Ellen, and is late for work. His absence makes no difference to anyone: though it is proper for wealthy young men to have a profession, they achieve very little. He worries that after he marries, he may not be able to pursue his real interests, European travel and talking to ""clever people,"" which even now are confined to the margins of his life.
	From the office, he sends a message to Ellen asking if he might call that afternoon. On the third morning he gets a reply from her at Skuytercliff. She writes that she ran away to think things over and that she feels safe there. Archer had just refused an invitation from friends, the Chiverses, who live near Skuytercliff. Now, he sends them a telegram saying he will come after all.
	Archer visits Skuytercliff from his base at the Chivers' house, but Ellen is out at church with Mrs van der Luyden. He goes to meet the carriage and meets Ellen walking along the road. He tells her he came to see what she was running away from. She says it does not matter, now that he is here to protect her. He asks her what has happened. She takes him to the van der Luydens' Patroon's house, which Mr van der Luyden has opened up, to tell him in privacy. He again asks her what she is running from. She puts her hand into his but, before she can reply, Julius Beaufort arrives. Ellen is surprised to see him, but Archer draws away from Ellen and invites Beaufort in, telling him dryly that he is expected.
	It becomes clear to Archer that Ellen did not know Beaufort was coming, and that she is annoyed by his presence. The narrator tells us that Ellen was running away from Beaufort: the question is whether she was running because his attentions displeased her, or whether she did not trust herself to resist them. Archer worries that she is drawn to Beaufort by his cosmopolitan background and his familiarity with artistic people.
	Archer returns to New York, where he feels that he is being ""buried alive under his future"" (Chapter 16, p. 199). Several days later, he receives a note from Ellen asking him to visit her the next day, so that she can explain. But instead, he leaves to join the Wellands at St Augustine.
	Analysis
	The leave-taking scene at the theatre, full of unspoken emotion, is to become highly symbolic to Archer, who feels that it represents his leave-taking from Ellen. The metaphor of performance expresses the fact that Archer and Ellen have had to pretend and not been true to their love.
	Archer is given an opportunity to become closer to Ellen by responding to her invitation to continue the intimate discussion that was foiled at Skuytercliff. But instead, he goes to join May at St Augustine, choosing what is 'right' over what he thinks he wants.
	Archer's loyalties are torn between his drive to individuality and his drive to conform to society's conventions. On one hand, he approves of Ellen's leaving her husband, but he advises her to avoid the stigma of divorce. He intends to make a conventional marriage, but associates with bohemian types like Winsett.
	Archer's divided sense of self is shown too in his theoretical championing of women's freedom, which he finds difficult to put into practice. He jealously assumes that Beaufort and Ellen are having an affair. Under this apprehension, he speaks to her contemptuously. Evidently, he is allowed to continue his engagement to May while secretly loving Ellen, but she is not allowed similar freedom.
	The futility of Archer's life as his marriage looms is a strong theme of this section. His lateness at the office makes no difference to anybody; he is a lawyer only because it is expected that a gentleman will have an occupation. His interests lie in European travel and cultivating what his sister calls ""clever people,"" but he worries about what will happen when he marries: ""what would become of the narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?"" (Chapter 14, p. 107)

Summary
	Archer arrives at St Augustine, impatient to bring forward the date of his marriage. Letterblair indulges Archer over his absence from work on the grounds that Archer dealt with the Olenski divorce to the satisfaction of the Welland-Mingott family. Mrs Welland thanks Archer for using his influence to dissuade Ellen from the divorce, and mentions that Ellen has unbounded admiration for him. Mrs Welland wonders what Ellen's fate will be. Archer thinks (though does not say) that it will be what they all contrive to make it: denied a divorce and the freedom to marry some decent man, she may be forced into becoming Beaufort's mistress.
	Archer does not want May's innocence to be like her mother's - an innocence that ""seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience"" (Chapter 16, p. 123). Mrs Welland tells Archer that she refused to listen when Ellen tried to talk to her about her situation. Mr Welland grew so upset at the prospect of May learning ""that such things were possible"" that he became ill (Chapter 16, p. 124).
	Archer presses May to allow their marriage to be brought forward. She wonders why it should be so important, and asks Archer if it is because he is not certain of continuing to care for her and because there is someone else. She wants them to talk frankly. He does not manage this, however, answering her question with another: if he felt their coming wedding was a mistake, why would he try to hasten it? May answers that he might want to settle the question by decisive action. She believes her rival is Mrs Rushworth. She tells Archer she does not want her happiness made out of a wrong to another. She believes that if two people love each other, there may be situations in which they should go against public opinion. She offers to give him up for this other woman.
	Archer is awe-struck at having escaped confessing his feelings for Ellen, and by May's generosity. He does not admit to loving anyone else. He tells her he feels as she does on the pointlessness of conventionalities, and asks again if they can bring their marriage forward. May seems timorous, and Archer drops the subject.
	Archer calls on Mrs Mingott, and tells her that May refused to hasten the marriage. Mrs Mingott thinks her family are ""in a rut."" She is thankful that she is ""vulgar,"" and adds that the only one of her family who takes after her is Ellen. She asks Archer why he did not marry Ellen. He says she wasn't there to be married, and asks Mrs Mingott to use her influence to hasten his marriage to May.
	Ellen arrives. Mrs Mingott tells Ellen that Archer rushed to St Augustine to try to bring his marriage forward. Ellen suggests to Mrs Mingott that they might persuade the Wellands to do as Archer wishes.
	Archer visits Ellen at her home and meets there Ned Winsett and the bohemian Medora Manson. Also present is Dr Agathon Carver, founder of an alternative community called ""The Valley of Love."" Dr Carver leaves. Medora thanks Archer for his good advice to Ellen over the divorce. Count Olenski has petitioned Medora to persuade Ellen to take him back, on her terms. Medora stresses the material benefits of being married to the Count. She asks Archer to support her in convincing Ellen to return to her husband. Archer replies that he would rather see her dead.
	Ellen enters and tells her maid to throw away the flowers that the Count has sent her, but then sends them instead to Ned Winsett's wife, who is ill.
	Left alone with Ellen, Archer tells her that May wants a long engagement to give him time to give her up for another woman. Ellen is struck by May's nobility. Ellen suggests that he does not care for anyone else, but Archer corrects her: he does not mean to marry anyone else. She asks if the other woman loves him, but he denies that there is another woman. Ellen's carriage arrives to take her to Mrs Struthers'. Archer, wanting to keep Ellen with him, admits that May is right. There is another woman, though not the one May thinks. He tells Ellen he would have married her if it had been possible. Ellen points out that it is he who has made it impossible, by opposing her divorce; he showed her how selfish it would be, and that she must sacrifice herself to spare the family from scandal. For the sake of him and May and the family, she did as he asked. Archer sinks into despair as he realizes what he has done.
	Ellen begins to cry. They kiss, and Archer comforts her, saying that nothing is done that cannot be undone. He is still free, and she could be. But Ellen says it is too late to alter their course, as he has taught her to hate ""happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference"" (Chapter 18, p. 146). She cannot love him unless she gives him up.
	Ellen's maid comes in with a telegram. It is from May, telling Ellen that due to Mrs Mingott's intervention, May's parents have agreed to an earlier wedding. Archer laughs bitterly: his fate has been settled.
	Analysis
	The damage wreaked by New York society's repressive mores is made clear in Archer's ironic comment that Ellen, denied a divorce and the freedom to marry a decent man, could be forced into becoming Beaufort's mistress. In a further irony, however, Wharton has him think this comment without speaking it out: to do so would render him socially unacceptable. With no one prepared to make waves, the smooth surface of New York society remains unbroken.
	The unrealistic expectations placed on women by New York society are made clear by Archer's wish that May has innocence, but not like her mother's - ""the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience"" (Chapter 16, p. 123). Archer is more drawn to Ellen's greater experience and depth, but he draws back from embracing it fully.
	That May understands more than Archer gives her credit for is revealed when she suspects that he wants to hasten their marriage because he is not certain of continuing to care for her. May, whom Archer deems as blind as a cave-fish, boldly challenges Archer to tell the truth. This is a perfect opportunity for him to admit his feelings for Ellen. But Archer fails to match her courage and does not admit to loving another. He is helped in his deception by her mistaken assumption that her rival is the married woman in Archer's past, Mrs Rushworth. Relieved at having escaped interrogation about Ellen, he claims that he feels as May does about the pointlessness of convention, while rapidly retreating into it. He asks May once more to bring forward the wedding.
	Archer's subsequent attempt to back out of his marriage to May and be with Ellen comes too late. Ellen tells him that, in opposing her divorce, he has taught her to sacrifice her own wishes for the good of others. She cannot allow him to cause May and the family unhappiness in order to buy her own happiness. This turn of events is tragically ironic. Archer has denied his own views (that Ellen should be free) and dutifully parroted the family's view that she must not bring scandal on the family through divorce. He has taught Ellen to deny her own fulfillment and his.
	During his visit to Ellen, his fate is sealed by May's telegram announcing the bringing forward of the wedding date. Archer responds with terrible ironic laughter. We shall see this response again, and in each case it comes at a time when fate delivers him a package which, by conforming to convention, he has enabled society to prepare for him.

Summary
	Under the eyes of New York society, Archer marries May in a kind of daze, while thinking of Ellen. Mrs Manson Mingott is unable to attend, being too large to fit into the church. Her family are relieved, since they find her appearance embarrassing. Also absent is Ellen, who has gone to Washington with Medora. Ellen has written to May saying that neither of them is well enough to make the journey. Medora, however, does turn up.
	Since her moment of awareness in St Augustine, when she offered to give Archer up, May has regressed to her previous state of inexpressiveness, and Archer finds himself looking at her as a stranger might.
	Archer and May leave for their honeymoon. Mr van der Luyden arranges for them to stay at the Patroon's house, where Archer and Ellen had a poignant encounter. Then the couple travel to Europe. May worries that she is expected to visit the Archer family's foreign acquaintances. Such is New York society's fear of Europeans that people like May travel abroad in a state of isolation. Though travel is a particular interest of Archer's, May sees it only as an opportunity for pursuing her love of sports. Archer has given up on the idea of emancipating his wife, ""who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free."" But he admires her devotion, loyalty, and fineness of feeling for him. He plans to sustain his artistic and intellectual life outside the domestic circle.
	In London, Archer and May visit two old friends of Mrs Archer's. They introduce him to a Frenchman who acts as the family's tutor, called M. Riviere. Archer and the cultured Riviere get along well. Though as poor as Ned Winsett, Riviere has lived a rich life, surrounded by literary geniuses and men of ideas. Riviere gave up journalism because it compromised his independence, and has worked as a private secretary and tutor. He asks Archer if there might be a job for him in America, but Archer feels that in that country, his gifts would hinder his success.
	Archer tells May that he would like to invite Riviere to dinner, but she only laughs and dismisses the tutor as common. Archer fears that this is how disagreements between them will be solved in future.
	Archer and May have settled into the newly built greenish-yellow house with the Pompeian vestibule, which he had despised. He has, however, arranged his library to his own taste, to the disapproval of the family. Archer wants to take May on holiday to a cottage on an island off the coast of Maine, but the Wellands always go to Newport, so that is where he ends up going.
	Married life for Archer has settled into a predictable routine. He has trained himself to view the ""momentary madness"" of his encounter with Ellen on the eve of his marriage as the last of a series of discarded amorous experiments. But his mind feels like an empty and echoing place.
	At the Beauforts' party in Newport, which hosts the annual archery competition, rumors are circulating about Beaufort. He has been seen with Fanny Ring, a woman of dubious repute (a prostitute or professional mistress, though this is not stated). He is also reported to be in financial trouble.
	Archer watches the archery competition, which May wins. Beaufort says contemptuously, ""that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit."" He is sneering at May's ""niceness."" Though Archer thinks this observation from a coarse man is proof of her quality, he worries: ""What if 'niceness' carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness?"" (Chapter 21, p. 180). He has never lifted that curtain.
	Archer and May call on Mrs Mingott on their way home from the party. Mrs Mingott reveals that Ellen is staying with her, though she has gone for a walk to the seashore. Mrs Mingott asks Archer to go and fetch her. Ellen now lives in Washington, and has proved a great attraction in Washington society.
	Archer walks to the shore and sees Ellen in the summer-house. The sight of her is like a dream; his reality now is the Wellands' world. He remembers the scene in the play, of the lover kissing the lady's ribbon without her knowing. He makes a bargain with himself: if she doesn't turn and look at him before the sail of a passing boat crosses a rock, he will go back without speaking to her. He waits, but she does not turn. He goes back to the house alone.
	May muses that perhaps Ellen does not care any more for her former friends. She spends much time with the Blenkers, whom May believes to be ""queer people."" She wonders if she wouldn't be happier with her husband. Archer is shocked by her cruel remark, and asks how anyone could be happier in hell.
	Back in his home, Archer feels a reversal of mood: where seeing Ellen had seemed like a dream, now that scene on the shore feels as real as the blood in his veins. It is the Welland atmosphere, with its minute observances, that affects his system like a narcotic. His life there seems unreal and irrelevant.
	Analysis
	Archer likens his wedding to the first night at the opera, another example of the performance metaphor that recurs in the novel. The effect is to draw attention to the unreality of the event: Archer, after all, loves another. The marriage between Archer and May, like most society marriages, is characterized by a mixture of mystery, fear, and awe, which in turn is sustained by things unacknowledged or unsaid. He has no idea what, if anything, lies behind the theatre curtain of May's ""niceness.""
	May's dismissal of the French tutor Riviere, whom Archer finds fascinating, as common, bodes ill for their marriage. Archer will have to keep what he considers his real life - his literary, artistic and travel interests - separate from his life with her. There is pathos in Archer's only visible victory in self-expression thus far in his marriage - his arrangement of his library to his own taste. Even this has earned disapproval from his family.

Summary
	Mr and Mrs Emerson Sillerton invite the Wellands to a party for the Blenkers. Mr Welland makes his excuses, but Mrs Welland decides that she will call in briefly, so that the Sillertons are not offended. Archer says he will drive to a stud farm to look for a second horse for May's carriage.
	Though Archer does call at the stud farm, he really wants to see the Blenkers' house because Ellen is living there. If he could carry away that vision, the rest of his world would seem less empty. He thinks that Ellen will be away from home, in Newport with the Blenkers, or visiting her grandmother, Mrs Mingott.
	He sees a pink parasol in the summer-house, and, believing it is Ellen's, heads towards it. But it belongs to one of the Blenker girls. Miss Blenker says that Ellen has been called away to Boston.
	Archer tells May that he has to go to Boston on business. He even uses a letter that arrives for him from the office to justify his plan - a deception which reminds him of the adulterer Lefferts's contrivances. In Boston the next day, he sees Ellen sitting on a bench on the common. She says she is here on business. She tells him that she has refused to take back money that belonged to her, because she could not agree to the conditions - to sit at the head of her husband's table occasionally. Count Olenski had not come himself, but had sent an emissary. Archer thinks this is the man with whom Ellen reportedly had the affair. The emissary is waiting till tonight before leaving, in case she changes her mind.
	Archer asks her to spend the day with him. She asks him why he did not come down to the beach to her when she was at Mrs Mingott's. He says, because she didn't look round at him. She says she did not look round on purpose and that she was trying to get as far away from Archer as she could. He tells her that he has come to Boston to see her. She goes back to her hotel to leave a note for the emissary, where Archer sees a man whose face he half-recognizes.
	Ellen joins Archer and tells him of her life in the one and a half years since they met. She had grown tired of New York society, feeling herself too different to care for the things it cared about. So she had settled in Washington, where there were supposed to be more varieties of people and opinions.
	Archer wonders why she does not go back to Europe. She says, because of him. She starts to tell Archer how he has changed her, but he interrupts her by saying how she has changed him: ""I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to."" She says that he has given up something he wanted (her) to save others (May) from disillusionment and misery; at least May is happy. If this was not a worthwhile sacrifice, then everything she has come to value in her ""new"" life is a sham.
	Archer savagely says that she gave him his first sight of real life, and at the same moment asked him to go on with a sham one. She bursts into tears, confessing that she is suffering just as he is. Archer feels overwhelmed by a sense of waste, chained as they are to their separate destinies. She promises him that she will not go back to Europe as long as they do not act on their love for each other.
	Analysis
	Ellen's comment to Archer that she finds Dr Carver's crazy social schemes more interesting than the blind conformity to tradition that she finds in New York society is revealing. As she points out, that tradition is not even America's own - it is borrowed from the old European countries from which the settlers came: ""It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country.""
	The tragic element of the novel reaches its apotheosis in the scene between Archer and Ellen in Boston. He realizes that if he acts on his love for her, he will drive her away, so much has she taken to heart his previous arguments that it is wrong to buy one's happiness at another's expense. She will stay only if he and she are not together. The individual has been sacrificed at the altar of the family and society.
	However, Wharton undermines Archer's tragic status by comparing his easy deception of May in visiting Boston to the contrivances of the adulterer Lefferts. Are they different? If we saw events from Lefferts's point of view instead of Archer's, would we sympathize with him as much? Wharton creates some sympathy for Archer by distinguishing his feelings for Ellen from his more superficial feelings for May. While he had been awed by May's physical beauty, he feels a ""curious indifference to [Ellen's] bodily presence""; his connection with Ellen is more intellectual and emotional.
	We learn that Ellen knew Archer was at the beach when he was asked to fetch her by Mrs Mingott. Archer had put their failure to speak to each other down to the fate that caused her not to turn round and see him. But in fact, both consciously chose not to speak; the responsibility for their not meeting lies with them, and not chance or fate.

Summary
	As he leaves Boston, Archer feels tranquil, even though he has no promise of further opportunities to see Ellen. She has held a perfect balance between their loyalty to others and honesty to themselves. He is glad that he did not tempt her. She will go back to Europe only if she feels she is becoming a temptation to Archer; she will stay near him as long as he does not ask her to come nearer.
	Back in New York at the railway station, he recognizes the man he saw coming out of the Boston hotel. It is M. Riviere. Riviere tells him that he has been sent here on a special mission and that he wishes to consult him about it. He is Count Olenski's emissary to Ellen. He has failed to persuade Ellen to fall in with the Count's wishes. He considers that his mission on behalf of the Count is over.
	Riviere begs Archer to persuade her family that it is a bad idea for her to go back to her husband. He has had talks with several members of Ellen's family, all of whom want Ellen to go back to her husband. Archer suddenly knows why he has been excluded from these discussions: some tribal instinct has told the family that he is no longer on their side. He realizes that May's remark that perhaps Ellen would be happier with her husband had been held up deliberately as a straw in the wind. She had reported his angry response to the family, and they had thereafter left him out of their counsels.
	Riviere had carried out his mission from the Count in good faith, as he had believed at first that it would be better for her to go back. But after he had listened to her and seen the change in her since she had been in America, he had changed his mind. Riviere says he used to see her in her husband's house, as he knew the Count. This leads Archer to wonder if Riviere is the secretary who helped Ellen escape and with whom she lived for a year. Riviere says that the Count's wish to have her back is not simply, as her relatives think, a longing for domestic life. Archer thanks him.
	Rumors continue to circulate about Beaufort's shady business dealings. Though society tolerates hypocrisy in private relations, it exacts an impeccable honesty in business dealings. If there is any truth in the rumors, nothing will save Regina Beaufort from social disgrace, even the fact that she is of the pre-eminent Dallas family. However, Beaufort is asking influential people to tide him over.
	Every year, Archer's mother complains that the customs of New York society are changing for the worse. Dress has become more extravagant and amusement is pursued for its own sake. Mrs Struthers has become acceptable, and even May goes to her parties, though Mrs Archer has not quite forgiven Ellen for being the first to accept Mrs Struthers. The family has taken to discussing Ellen in a deprecating tone, since she refused to go back to her husband. The Welland-Mingotts had ""let poor Ellen find her own level,"" which had been with people like the Blenkers and ""people who wrote.""
	May blushes when Ellen is mentioned. Archer wonders what this can mean. He has not seen Ellen for four months, since the day in Boston. She has returned to Washington. She has become part of his secret life of unexpressed thoughts and longings.
	At the Archers' house, Sillerton Jackson says it is a pity that Ellen refused her husband's offer. What will she live on, now that Beaufort looks set to be ruined? Archer is furious at the implication of adultery. Sillerton says that Mrs Mingott has told him that the family reduced Ellen's allowance when she refused to go back to her husband. By this refusal, she also forfeited the money settled on her when she married, which Olenski was prepared to make over to her if she returned.
	Archer says he knows nothing of her finances, but he objects to Sillerton's insinuation that Ellen was kept by Beaufort. Sillerton protests that he doesn't say this, but Lefferts does. Archer points out contemptuously that Lefferts courted Ellen and got snubbed. Sillerton reflects that it is a pity that Ellen has not gone back before, since if Beaufort is ruined and she goes back now, it will confirm that she has been kept by Beaufort. Archer is sure that she will not go back. But Sillerton points out that Medora's small remaining funds are in Beaufort's hands.
	Archer is angry because Sillerton now knows that Archer knew nothing of Ellen's differences with the family. Sillerton will have concluded that Archer was left out of the family confidences because they think (wrongly) that he and Ellen are lovers.
	Archer despairs at the prospect of endless years with May. He tells her he may have to go to Washington on business, regarding a patent case before the Supreme Court. She agrees, and reminds him to go and see Ellen. Her comment is a coded message. It tells Archer that she knows that he has broken with the family policy and advised Ellen not to go back to her husband. She knows too that he will see Ellen in Washington.
	Archer hears that the lawsuit that will provide his cover story for going to Washington has been postponed. Archer does not intend to put off his visit, however, as May will probably not hear about the lawsuit.
	Rumors circulate that Beaufort will be helped through his troubles by powerful influences.
	Mr Letterblair tells Archer that Beaufort had not been ""tided over""; but had put out a rumor that he had been, thereby keeping money flowing into his bank. But the disturbing rumors had arisen once more, and people had started pulling their money out of the bank. This would ruin Beaufort. By his dishonest behavior in continuing to accept funds after he knew his bank would fail, Beaufort has added to his disgrace. Mr Letterblair worries about the effects on Archer's family, as they are relations.
	Archer receives a message from May asking him to come to see Mrs Mingott, who has had a stroke. She had heard about Beaufort's troubles from Regina Beaufort, who had visited her to ask the family to back them financially. Mrs Mingott had refused, but the shock of being asked to do such a dishonorable thing brought on the stroke.
	Mrs Mingott asks to see Ellen. May says that it is a pity that Ellen's train to New York will cross Archer's train bound for Washington on the way.
	Analysis
	Though New York society considers itself the height of sophistication, Wharton portrays it as primitive and tribal. Some tribal instinct has told the Welland-Mingott family that in the matter of Ellen, Archer is not on their side. Hence he has been left out of discussions that concluded that Ellen should go back to her husband.
	The fact that Rivi�re is able to enlist Archer to argue against Ellen's returning to her husband when he was previously enlisted by the family to argue that she should not divorce him confirms that Archer has never been perceived as his own person. In the battle for Ellen's mores, he is used first as a champion by society, then as the voice of Ellen's individual interests.
	Wharton's narrator is not omniscient, and there is much that we are not told and about which we can form our own judgments. We are not told whether Ellen and the secretary were lovers, or what the relationship is between Ellen and Beaufort, or how much May knows about her husband's feelings for Ellen. This creates in us an insecurity similar to that felt by the characters. For example, we must guess what people know about Archer's secret life, just as he must guess, and thus we are given a sense of his alienation from society.
	Archer's unsuccessful attempts to conform to society's demands have led him to set up a parallel life made up of his hidden desires, longings and thoughts. Ellen has become part of Archer's 'real' but secret life, where he brings the books he reads, and the ideas he has. Outside this world, ""in the scene of his actual life, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency, blunder against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room"" (Chapter 26, p. 224).
	It is clear from the coded, unspoken message that May gives to Archer in Chapter 26 that she knows he has broken ranks with her family and advised Ellen not to return to her husband. In true tribal fashion, May is in solidarity with her family on this issue; indeed, Archer knows from talking with Riviere that she deliberately sounded him out on the issue before reporting his traitorous conduct to her family. In the long unspoken dialogue, Wharton also implies that May knows more than she admits about Archer's feelings for Ellen. It would not be proper for May to say anything explicitly to Archer about this, so she pretends she is unaware of it.
	There is a sinister undertone to these episodes between May and Archer, in which nothing is explicitly said but everything is understood. Their marriage is a sort of triangular cold war with May, Archer and Ellen at its center, and May's family and society as the troops. It is not based on trust and friendship, but on mistrust, espionage, secret strategy meetings, coded messages, and exclusion of traitors.

Summary
	Archer sends a telegram to Ellen asking her to come to visit Mrs Mingott.
	News emerges that Beaufort is ruined, taking much of the money of New York's ruling clans down with him. It is the worse case of dishonor in memory. Mrs Beaufort too is disgraced, largely because of her seemingly cynical efforts to persuade others to bale her husband out. Mrs Archer feels that the Beauforts should retire quietly to the Regina's family's house in North Carolina to breed horses.
	The Archers receive a telegram from Ellen saying that she will arrive the following day. The Welland-Mingott family members find excuses why they cannot meet her at the station, so Archer offers to fetch her. Later, May asks him how he can meet Ellen when he is going to Washington for the court case. He tells her he is not going as the case is postponed. But May has seen a note saying that Mr Letterblair is going. Archer rapidly changes his story: Letterblair is going, so he will not. May asks whether the case is not postponed after all. Archer blushes and says it is not, but his going is. May pretends that she does not know he is lying.
	Archer collects Ellen from the railway station. He is surprised to realize that he barely remembers what she looks like. She asks if the carriage is May's. As if in retaliation for her reference to May, he tells her that M. Rivi�re has been to see him. He asks her whether it was Rivi�re who helped her get away from her husband. She says it was, but gives no clue as to the nature of their relationship. He tells her that she is an honest person who sees things as they are. She replies that she has had to, for she has looked at the Gorgon. In Greek mythology, the Gorgon was a monster so horrible that she was believed to blind those who looked at her. But contrary to legend, Ellen says, the Gorgon does not blind one, but dries up one's tears. The implication is that Ellen's experience has taught her to be realistic, not sentimental.
	They kiss. Archer says that he does not want a secretive love affair. He has a vision of their being together. Ellen laughs harshly. She asks him if he wants her to live with him as his mistress. He says he wants them to get away to a place where such words do not exist. Gently, she asks, ""Oh, my dear - where is that country? Have you ever been there?"" She has known many who have tried to find it, and settled for various European cities, which turned out to be no different from the places they'd left. She says they have no future together, apart from a tawdry one of trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them. There can be no escape from the judgments of others.
	Archer, angry and hurt, gets out of the carriage before they get to Mrs Mingott's.
	At home, May reports that the Mrs Mingott is improving and that the Beauforts intend to stay in New York. Archer is bored by their relationship and worries that she is turning into a copy of her mother. Feeling stifled, he opens the window. May asks him to shut it, as he will ""catch his death,"" and her words prompt him to a morbid wish that she would die and set him free.
	A week later, Mrs Mingott tells Archer that Ellen has agreed to come and live with her. She says that the family persuaded her to cut Ellen's allowance in order to make her go back to her husband. Olenski's secretary had put the Count's proposals to her, and she had agreed that they were favorable. But when she had seen Ellen again, she could not bear the thought of her being shut up in the cage of her marriage once more, and had asked her to come and nurse her instead. She has also restored Ellen's allowance.
	Archer is delighted, believing that Ellen has agreed to this proposal because she cannot give him up. Mrs Manson Mingott warns Archer that the family does not agree with her plan, and she asks him to back her up. Archer agrees. He asks if he can see Ellen, but she has gone to visit Regina Beaufort, to support her in her unhappy situation.
	Analysis
	New York society's treatment of the Beauforts shows its hypocrisy. It had always been known that Beaufort had indulged in shady dealings, but had been prepared to overlook this as long as the appearance of propriety was maintained. Indeed, people enjoyed Beaufort's private ballroom and went to his parties. But when his illicit dealings reached such heights as to become the subject of public gossip, society cut him and his wife off. It is felt that they should simply leave New York and live quietly somewhere else - as if not having the sinner under one's eyes made the sin vanish. Appearance is seen as more important than reality.
	May continues to pretend that she does not know about Archer's feelings for Ellen, when she clearly does know something. She would rather keep up the act of a happy marriage and deny the reality. Watching her attempts to hide what she knows pains Archer, and he feels pity for her.
	Archer, like May, is living in an illusory world. He imagines that he and Ellen can live somewhere apart from society's adverse judgments. Ellen is more realistic, and knows that there is no such place.

Summary
	Archer is stunned at Mrs Mingott's news. He feels that Ellen, frightened at the prospect of his making a decisive step from which there would be no possibility of return, has decided to compromise and have an affair with him. He worries that an affair might draw them into a life of lies and deceptions, and is concerned about how he will be perceived by society.
	He waits near Beaufort's house for Ellen. When she comes out, he grasps her hand and tells her that they will be together. He notices Lefferts and Chivers discreetly avoiding them, and is sickened by the thought that this could be their future. They arrange to meet the next day at the Metropolitan Museum.
	In the museum, Ellen tells Archer that she has decided to stay with Mrs Mingott because she feels she will be safer from temptation. She does not want to do irreparable harm, as others do in such situations. Archer protests that he is no different from the others; he has the same longings. She wavers, and asks if she should come once to him and then leave New York and go back to her husband. Archer does not believe they can give up their current lives. He miserably agrees that she will come to him the day after tomorrow.
	At home, May tells Archer that she has seen Ellen and had a long talk with her. She has decided that she has judged her too harshly and that she is fond of her despite her tendency to take up odd people. But she remarks that she has alienated the van der Luydens by going to visit the disgraced Regina Beaufort.
	The following evening, at the van der Luydens' pre-opera dinner, the topic of discussion is the Beauforts' ruin. Mrs van der Luyden asks May if it is true that Mrs Manson Mingott's carriage was outside Mrs Beaufort's door, an action they consider improper, given the Beauforts' disgrace.
	Archer and May go to the opera. May is dressed in her wedding dress, a common custom during the first year or so of marriage. Moved by the memory of her generosity when she told him she did not want her happiness to be made out of another's misery, he feels inspired to tell her the truth about Ellen, and ask for his freedom.
	At home, he begins to confess about himself and Ellen, but May stops him, saying that none of this matters now that ""it's all over"": Ellen is returning to Europe to live with Medora.
	Archer laughs bitterly, and goes to bed.
	May tells Archer that she wants to hold their first big dinner party, in honor of Ellen, who is leaving for Europe. Ellen is not, however, returning to her husband, and Archer thinks there is nothing to prevent him following her. His confidence in their future together has enabled him to restrain himself from contacting her. Mrs Mingott has given Ellen a generous trust fund.
	Ellen arrives at the Archers' dinner party, looking pale and almost ugly, though Archer thinks that he has never loved her more than at that moment. The guests are all kind to Ellen, now that she is leaving and will no longer pose a threat to their conventions. Suddenly, he realizes that everyone there thinks that he and Ellen are lovers. He now sees the dinner guests as conspirators in an elaborate ritual to mark the expulsion from the tribe of a member who has transgressed its code. He catches May's triumphant eyes; in the secret war between her and Ellen over Archer, she is the victor.
	As Archer bids Ellen goodbye, he says he will see her in Paris. She replies pointedly that he and May will be welcome. Lefferts catches him by the sleeve, asking him to cover for an illicit rendezvous.
	After their guests have left, Archer tries to tell May once more of his feelings for Ellen. He begins by saying that he wants to go away on a long trip. May says that he must take her with him, because she is pregnant. She is now sure, though she suspected it two weeks ago, and pretended to Ellen even then that she was sure.
	Analysis
	Faced with the prospect of an affair with Ellen, Archer is concerned about how this would appear to society. Contrary to his earlier belief that men who have illicit love affairs are seen as foolish, whereas women who do so are seen as criminal, he is now convinced that the men are judged more harshly than the women. Archer's fears about how such things are perceived are confirmed by the dinner party scene in Chapter 33. The guests assume, wrongly, that Archer has been unfaithful to May, and rally around her.
	Ellen's observation about the exhibits from dead cultures in the museum - that eventually, everything that seems important ceases to matter and ends up with a label saying, ""Use unknown"" - has immense resonance. The customs and traditions of New York society that circumscribe Archer's and Ellen's lives will one day be forgotten and irrelevant. Though The Age of Innocence is set in the 1870s, Wharton wrote it after World War I and published it in 1920, when the society portrayed in it was already defunct. It is the more tragic, then, that Archer's and Ellen's heartfelt desires are sacrificed to mores that have no more permanent value than obscure items in a glass case.
	The scene at the opera echoes the opening scene of the novel. On the face of it, little has changed. But there are important and revealing differences. Then, he was impatient to bring forward the announcement of his engagement to May; now, he is equally eager to dissolve their union. Then, his aim was to protect the honor of the family of his wife-to-be; now, he has less respect for convention and wants to pursue his illicit relationship with Ellen. May's tearing and soiling her wedding dress as she gets out of the carriage after the opera is symbolic of their decayed marriage.
	He is on the verge of confessing to May his love for Ellen when she tells him that Ellen is leaving for Europe. Once again, Archer is prevented from pursuing his love for Ellen, and responds with bitter laughter. (The first time was in Chapter 18.) However, these events are not the workings of a cruel fate. Both events have been prompted by Archer's own actions: the first time, by his persistent requests to May's family to bring forward his marriage; and the second, by his reckless decision to push his affair with Ellen into action, and also by his pursuance of family life with May to the point of starting a family. It is later revealed that May too has played a calculating part in Ellen's decision, challenging her husband's view of her as passive and unaware.
	The Archers' dinner party in honor of Ellen's departure is perhaps the most bitterly ironic scene in the novel. At last, New York society is behaving generously towards Ellen - but Archer realizes it is only because they are celebrating the expulsion from the tribe of a person who has transgressed their code. He also realizes the reason why it is essential, from their point of view, that she goes: they believe that Archer and Ellen are lovers. The deepest irony lies in the fact that this is the one thing that they have been unable to be. We are left to wonder whether, had they given in to temptation, they would have been any worse off. Has their sacrifice been for nothing?
	Archer feels ""like a prisoner in the center of an armed camp"" (Chapter 33, p. 286), reinforcing the sense that Wharton creates of a war between the individual and society. Prompted by this feeling of imprisonment, Archer announces loudly that he intends to travel soon. Later, he catches May's triumphant eyes and knows that she is the victor in an unspoken war with Ellen, with Archer as the prize.
	After the dinner party, Archer makes one more effort to tell May of his feelings for Ellen and break free. He is foiled once again, by her revelation that she is pregnant. Though she was not sure two weeks before, when she had her long talk with Ellen, she told Ellen that she was. This, Archer now knows, was what prompted Ellen not to follow through on the affair with Archer and to go instead to Europe. Faced with a pregnant wife, a mistress has no rights. As May tells Archer her news, her eyes are wet with victory - again, a war metaphor. May, far from the dull-minded innocent that Archer has believed her to be, has revealed herself to be a calculating opponent who glories in her triumph over her rival, Ellen.
",The Age of Innocence
123,The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapter 34,"Chapter 34
Summary
	It is twenty-five years after the Archers' dinner party for Ellen. Archer is reflecting about the past in his library. Their eldest son, Dallas, had been born, followed by Mary, who has married a son of Reggie Chivers, and their youngest, Bill. Dallas is artistic and is training to be an architect. Archer is known as a model citizen of New York and a philanthropist, and has made a foray into politics. He was a dutiful husband to May until she died of pneumonia, and had honestly mourned her death. He feels that he has missed out on ""the flower of life"" (p. 296), but now thinks of Ellen only as one might think of an imaginary beloved in a book or picture, as a symbol of all he has missed.
	May died believing the world to be a good place, full of harmonious and loving households like her own. But she was unaware that things had changed around her, and even her own children had concealed their views from her, just as Archer did his.
	There is little left of the restrictive old New York, to the extent that Lefferts's sneering prophecy of years before that if things went on at this rate, their children would be marrying Beaufort's bastards, has come true. Dallas is marrying Fanny Beaufort, and no one objects. After his wife's death, Beaufort had married Fanny Ring, and had gone to live abroad. Young Fanny is the offspring of their union.
	People now are too busy with reforms and fads to worry about what their neighbors are up to. Young people take it for granted that they will have what they want, whereas Archer's generation took it for granted that they wouldn't.
	Dallas persuades his father to accompany him to Europe. In Paris, Dallas arranges for them both to visit Ellen. Dallas asks his father whether Ellen wasn't the woman he would have given up everything for - but didn't. The son says that the day before May died, she told Dallas that she knew the children would be safe with Archer, ""because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you most wanted."" (p. 304). Archer, moved that May had guessed his feelings and pitied him, replies that she never asked him.
	Archer does not go with his son to visit Ellen. More than half a lifetime divided them, and he has no idea how she may have changed or whether she is living with someone. He asks his son to tell Ellen only that Archer is old-fashioned. He sits on a bench and looks up at her balcony, and thinks, ""It's more real to me here than if I went up"" (p. 308). A manservant comes out onto the balcony and closes the shutters, and Archer walks back alone to his hotel.
	Analysis
	Wharton breaks with the tradition of romantic novels in her inconclusive ending. There is nothing to prevent Archer and Ellen from being reunited; even society has moved on from the restrictions that had previously bound them. If they were reunited, they would either find that they had changed too much and had nothing in common, or they would at last be together. But neither resolution occurs. The reader is likely to feel frustrated and dissatisfied, exactly as Archer and Ellen have felt over their unconsummated affair.
	Critics have given different interpretations of why Archer refuses to go up and see Ellen. Some see it as a brave and wise decision; others as cowardice. Wharton tells us that Archer would rather hold on to the memory of Ellen than have 'real life' impinge on his own reality and, perhaps, destroy it. But the effect of the ending is to cast an extremely ironic light on what has gone before. Archer has struggled and fought against the societal restrictions that disapproved of his union with Ellen - though never resolutely enough to break through them utterly. Now, those restrictions have melted away, yet Archer still cannot reach out and embrace the love that has dominated his life throughout the novel. It is clear that the prison was not so much an objective reality as a creation of the minds of society people like Archer. It is like an agreement between the members of a club. Archer has imprisoned himself, and continues to do so, rather like a guinea pig who is so used to living in a cage that he will not leave it even when the door is left open. His half-hearted attempts to escape showed an irresolution that measured poorly against even May's single-minded determination to preserve her marriage against the incursion of Ellen.

124,My Antonia: Novel Summary,"Introduction
My Ántonia opens with a short frame story: the author (presumably Willa Cather) relates a chance meeting with an old acquaintance, Jim Burden, on a train ride through Iowa.  The time appears to be roughly contemporary with the publication of the novel (1918).  The two adults reminisce about their shared Nebraska childhood, where they first met, and they mention a woman named Ántonia.  They challenge each other to write an account of their relationship with Ántonia, and only Jim appears to follow through, composing a lengthy manuscript and bringing it to her a few months later.  The author says that this manuscript became the text of My Ántonia. 
Analysis
	Cather chooses this character of Jim Burden as the narrator for two obvious reasons. It allows her to manipulate or mediate the perspective that she uses to write about Ántonia (as a romantic interest, as an exceptionally strange woman, among many other perspectives), and it displaces some of the credit/blame for the story to someone else without moving too far away from her (someone from her hometown in Nebraska, who understands life in a small prairie town).
	 
	A frame story is a narrative within which a character proceeds to tell a story.  
Book I: The Shimerdas
Parts I – IV
Part I
	The book opens with Jim Burden, the narrator, being taken west from Virginia to Nebraska to live with his grandparents after his parents’ deaths.  Jake Marpole, a farm hand who worked for Jim’s parents, accompanies him.  Jake is a young man at the time, and Jim is ten years old.  They take a train across the country, and they hear about an immigrant family traveling on the same train going to the same place, Black Hawk, Nebraska.  Jake buys and gives Jim a copy of The Life of Jesse James, a book he treasures for many years. 
	When they arrive at Black Hawk, Jake and Jim see the immigrant family (the Shimerdas), and hear the family talking in a foreign language.  They are greeted by Otto Fuchs, a German immigrant and employee of Jim’s grandparents.  Jim compares Fuchs to a character from the Jesse James book—he is visibly tanned and scarred, and dressed like a cowboy—and Fuchs leads them to a wagon to take them to the Burdens’ farm.  Jim notices the immigrant family again, getting into the only other wagon present. Fuchs drives them over the Nebraska land, and Jim thinks to himself about how empty and featureless the land is compared to Virginia.  He realizes he has left his parents behind, and he feels intimidated and insignificant under the vast sky and wide, flat land.
	Part II
	Jim falls asleep in the wagon and wakes up in his grandparents’ house.  He sees his grandmother when he opens his eyes, and she immediately compares him to her dead son—Jim’s father—and invites him into the kitchen.  Jim makes his way out of bed and down to the basement kitchen, and he seems impressed by the order and cleanliness of the arrangement.  He takes a bath in the tin washtub in the kitchen while his grandmother is in the attached dining room, refusing her help with cleaning himself.  Jim notices the details of the kitchen, acquaints himself with the pets of the house, and muses for a little while on his impressions of his grandparents.  Otto Fuchs introduces him to one of the horses, and Jim, Otto, and Jake are called upstairs for prayers.  The next day, Jim goes outside and starts to get to know the town.  His grandparents apparently live in the only wooden house in the entire town; the neighbors live in sod houses.  Most of the area around the house, at least the part not covered with corn, is covered with wild red grass. 
	As Jim is musing on the red grass, his grandmother invites him to accompany her to the garden to dig up some potatoes.  She tells him that he should never go to the garden without some kind of weapon to protect him from rattlesnakes.  After digging some potatoes, Jim asks if he can stay in the garden without his grandmother.  She agrees, but she gives him some information about all of the various animals that he might see.  He spends a good portion of the day in the garden, and he enjoys the feeling that he has become part of the land. 
	Part III
	A few days later, Jim accompanies Otto Fuchs on a trip to visit the new Bohemian family in the town with a gift of some provisions.  Jim finds out that the Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, bought a piece of land not far from his grandparents, and that they had paid too much for it.  They had been swindled by Peter Krajiek, a Bohemian man who was already living there.  No one in the family spoke enough English to survive without Krajiek, so he also functioned as their interpreter.  Fuchs suggests that he might have helped them with Krajiek, except that he doesn’t think the Shimerdas will trust an Austrian.  When asked to explain, Fuchs says that it’s “politics,” and that it would take too long, but that Bohemians don’t trust Austrians. 
	As the Grandmother, Fuchs, and Jim make their way to the Shimerdas’ farm, they notice Squaw Creek, a narrow stream that runs through a deep ravine through the Shimerdas’ land.  The ravine makes farming that piece of land difficult and reduces its value.  They come upon the Shimerdas’ house, a dugout built against the edge of the ravine.  Mrs. Shimerda comes out of the house to meet them, and shakes Grandmother’s hand.  She speaks a little English about the house, saying that it is no good.  Ántonia and Yulka, the two daughters, come out of the house and meet the visitors, as does Ambrosch, the oldest son.  Ántonia, Jim notices, is brown-skinned and brown-eyed, and quite beautiful.  She is about fourteen years old, a few years older than Jim.  While the two families are talking, Krajiek and Marek, the second son who shows off a webbed finger and acts a bit strangely, approach from the barn.  At some point, Mr. Shimerda emerges, and Jim is greatly impressed by his appearance and his demeanor.  Mr. Shimerda doesn’t seem to belong on a farm; he seems too aristocratic for farm labor. 
	Ántonia and Yulka drag Jim away from his family and bring him over to the edge of the ravine.  Ántonia starts quizzing him on the English names for things, including his own.  Jim teaches her several English words, and she tries to repay him with a gift of a ring.  After a little while, Mr. Shimerda comes looking for the girls, and they run to meet him.  Mr. Shimerda confronts Jim with a silent, questioning look.  Then he returns to the house, takes out a book with Bohemian and English alphabets, and asks Grandmother to teach Ántonia English. 
	Part IV
	Jim learns to ride one of his grandparents’ horses, and he becomes the messenger for the family.  As the messenger, with the freedom of travel that he has with the horse, he becomes a sightseer, traveling about the area to admire the landscapes.  He also instructs Ántonia in English every day.  She runs across the prairie between them, and Jim shares some of the watermelon from the farm with her.  Jim also notices the ways that the rattlesnakes take advantage of the prairie dogs in the area, and compares Krajiek to a rattlesnake in a prairie dog town.  The Shimerdas don’t know how to get rid of their only English-speaking Bohemian companion. 
Analysis, Parts I-IV
	Cather sets the Shimerda family up in a way that seems to promise catastrophe.  In her description of Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch, she suggests that they are self-interested and cunning.  Mr. Shimerda appears to be set up to be a victim of tragedy, as a kind of great man set up to suffer through inappropriate or unsuitable challenges.  He is a musician but there is no one who will listen to him.  The family also appears to be facing a difficult struggle, with a poor house and a poor plot of land to farm, and only a cheating Krajiek to help them succeed as farmers.  Jim’s family appears as welcome charity to the Shimerdas, but Jim’s family has no solution for the bulk of the Shimerdas’ problems.

Part I Chapters I-III

	 
Summary
	Chapter I
	Gulliver summarizes the story of his life before the main plot begins with his arrival in the country of Lilliput. He is the third of five sons of the owner of an estate in Nottinghamshire, England. He is educated at Cambridge University and serves an apprenticeship with a surgeon. After marrying a woman called Mary Burton, he takes up a post as surgeon aboard a ship traveling to the South Seas. On the way to the East Indies, the ship is blown onto rocks and wrecked. Gulliver manages to swim to land and falls asleep from exhaustion. When he awakes, he finds that he is tied to the ground and surrounded by tiny human beings of six inches high. He tries to escape his bonds, but they fire arrows at him, causing him pain. One makes a speech in a language he does not understand. He signals that he is hungry, and the little people feed him with baskets of food. He is tempted to crush them, but resists because he fears that they could harm him and because he feels that he has made them a promise of honor by his submissive behavior.
	An emissary from the Emperor climbs onto Gulliver's body and makes clear that he is to be conveyed to the capital city. There, they give him a disused temple to live in and tether him to it with a chain.
	Chapter II
	Gulliver describes in detail the difficult process of defecation, with the aim of defending himself against accusations of uncleanliness. The first time, he relieves himself inside his house, but thereafter he does so outside the house, and his excrement is taken away by servants.
	The Emperor arrives and makes a speech. Afterwards, some people in the crowd shoot arrows at Gulliver. The colonel delivers them to Gulliver for punishment, but he sets them free. The Lilliputians are impressed by this show of mercy.
	The Emperor holds a council to debate what to do with Gulliver. His advisors are concerned that he will cause a famine because he eats so much, and that if they kill him, his carcass might cause a plague. The debate is interrupted by the arrival of army officers, who report Gulliver's mercy to his attackers. The Emperor and his advisors are so pleased that they arrange for him to be fed, clothed, and taught their language.
	Gulliver receives many visits from the Emperor and repeatedly asks for his freedom. The Emperor refuses, saying that Gulliver must first swear to honor a peace treaty.
	Chapter III
	Gulliver describes two diversions which are practiced by people seeking positions and honors at court. The first is rope-dancing, whereby candidates for office at court dance on a rope. Whoever jumps highest without falling is given the job. Sometimes, existing ministers are expected to show that they still possess this skill. The rivalry is such that often there are fatal accidents, as ministers strain too far and fall. In the second activity, candidates for honors at court must leap over, and creep under, a stick held out by the Emperor. Whoever shows most agility at ""leaping and creeping"" is awarded a piece of colored silk.
	The people begin to trust Gulliver, and he arranges for the Emperor to organize military exercises on his handkerchief.
	At last, the Emperor allows the subject of Gulliver's freedom to be debated in his council. The only one to oppose it is Skyresh Bolgolam, the Admiral, who has made himself Gulliver's enemy. Bolgolam is overruled, but he draws up a list of conditions to which Gulliver must agree. These include not leaving the country without the Emperor's permission, not trampling on the people, and helping the Lilliputians fight their enemies from the Island of Belfescu, who are about the invade. In return, the Lilliputians promise to feed him. Gulliver agrees and is released from his chains.
	Analysis
	Swift goes to some lengths to portray his protagonist, Gulliver, and his travels with an air of realism. Gulliver's background is described in credible detail, and his journey to Lilliput is presented in the style of a travelogue, including references to actual places such as the West Indies. When he reaches Lilliput, details about the country and its people are given which are aimed at painting a believable picture of real human beings in a real society. This serves Swift's satirical purpose, as the implication is that the Lilliputians are sufficiently like the reader for the reader to apply what is said about them to his or her own society.
	The only far-fetched aspect of Lilliput is the minuscule size of the people, but this too makes an important satirical point. Though the average Lilliputian adult is about six inches tall, the Lilliputians think of themselves as important and impressive, and of their affairs as highly significant. Gulliver reports of the Emperor, ""He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders"" (Chapter II). In Skyresh Bolgolam's document listing the conditions of Gulliver's freedom, the Emperor is addressed by his long name and is called the ""delight and terror of the universe . . . whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes against the sun ."" (Chapter III). This is ludicrous exaggeration for the purpose of flattery, as the Emperor is tiny in comparison to Gulliver. The effect of Swift's satire is to puncture the pomposity of human beings - those of Gulliver's size as much as that of the Lilliputians. After all, who is to say that there is not some Gulliver who dwarfs human society on Earth? Size is relative, and, Swift suggests that in the greater scheme of things, the human race may be less awe-inspiring than it believes.
	The Lilliputians' smallness also draws attention to their moral limitations. They (particularly their leaders) are morally diminished people in comparison to Gulliver, who is a fairly honest and well-meaning man.
	Swift satirizes the system of appointments and honors in contemporary European courts in his description of the Lilliputian diversions of rope-dancing and ""leaping and creeping"" (Chapter III). Positions at court are given to those who can dance highest on the rope without falling. Similarly, honors (the pieces of colored silk awarded to Lilliputian favorites accurately describe some of the real honors given by real monarchs) are given to those who leap over, and creep under, a stick held by the Emperor with most agility. In both cases, Swift means that people at court are promoted not because of worth but because they please the monarch in some way, perhaps with elaborate flattery.
	European society's obsession with time is satirized in the Lilliputians' assumption that Gulliver's watch is a god that he worships, since ""he seldom did any thing without consulting it"" (Chapter II).
	Many critics have noted Swift's preoccupation with bodily functions (called scatology). This section of Gulliver's Travels is an example. Gulliver's habits of defecation and urination are detailed, along with an episode in which the Emperor has Gulliver stand with his legs apart and marches his army march underneath them, whereupon they cannot resist looking up. It is probable that such material reflects Swift's own preoccupations, but it also serves his satirical purpose. The eighteenth century, when Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels, was called ""the Age of Enlightenment"" when writers and thinkers emphasized the power of man's reason to lift him above the lower kingdom of animals. Reason was thought to be the basis of ethics, aesthetics, and proper government, as well as the way in which man could obtain knowledge of the truth. Some commentators believed it to be a divine faculty that brought man close to God. In Gulliver's Travels, Swift celebrates reason in the form of the Houyhnhynms, who appear in Part IV (though significantly, he makes his reason-based characters horses, not people).
advertisement
But he was also convinced that man is an animal, complete with base appetites. His emphasis on bodily functions is a way of never letting his reader forget this.
	It is noteworthy that Gulliver seldom gives his own views of what he sees and hears on his travels. He is drawn as an objective and, indeed, naive, observer. This is another tactic that reinforces Swift's satirical purpose, as any satirical conclusions drawn belong to the reader, while Swift and his protagonist hide behind a veneer of innocence and impartiality.

127,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part I Chapters IV-VI,"Summary
Chapter IV
	Gulliver obtains the Emperor's permission to visit Mildendo, the capital city of Lilliput, where he visits the royal palace.
One morning, Reldresal, the Secretary of Private Affairs, visits Gulliver. He tells him that there are two sources of conflict in Lilliput, internal and external. The internal dissent is due to the two political parties in Lilliput which constantly fight each other. They are called Tramecksan and Slamecksan, and are distinguished from one another by the high or low heels worn by their adherents. The Emperor is a low heel and has decided to employ mostly low heels at court, but the heir to the throne is thought to incline more towards the high heels.
The external threat to Lilliput is that of invasion from the Island of Blefescu. Lilliput has long been at war with Blefescu as a result of disagreement over the correct way to break an egg: at the smaller end or the big end. Originally, Lilliput was a Big-Endian nation, but the present Emperor's grandfather once cut his finger while breaking his egg at the big end, and passed a decree ordering all his subjects to break their eggs at the smaller end. Since then, there have been rebellions around this issue in Lilliput, and these have been fomented by Blefescu, still a Big-Endian nation. Now, Blefescu is about to send its fleet to invade Lilliput, and the Emperor, who is convinced of Gulliver's valor and strength, wishes him to understand the situation. Gulliver sends a message back saying that although as a foreigner, it is not fitting for him to interfere in political parties, he is ready to risk his life in defense of the Emperor and his country.
Chapter V
	Gulliver wades and swims to Blefescu, armed with a cable and iron bars. He finds the enemy fleet. The Blefescudians are so afraid when they see him that they leap out of their ships and swim to shore. Enemy soldiers fire arrows at Gulliver, but he puts on his spectacles to protect his eyes and, using the cable and iron bars, ties the ships together and drags them back to Lilliput. The Lilliputians greet him as a hero and the Emperor confers upon him the highest title of honor. The Emperor, emboldened by this victory, wants to invade Blefescu and govern it as his province, forcing the people to break the smaller end of their eggs. Gulliver refuses to support this notion, which he believes to be the equivalent of enslaving the Blefescudians. The Emperor cannot forgive Gulliver, and he and a group of ministers begin plotting against him.
Ambassadors from Blefescu arrive and offer a peace agreement, which the Emperor agrees with conditions favorable to himself. Gulliver uses his influence at court to help the Blefescudians with regard to the treaty, and they invite him to visit their country. Gulliver asks the Emperor's permission to go, and he agrees, but coldly. Gulliver learns that Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer, and Bolgolam have represented to the Emperor Gulliver's dealings with the Blefescudian ambassadors as disloyalty. For the first time, Gulliver thinks that courts and ministers may not be perfect.
One night, Gulliver is awakened by people milling around his door. Courtiers arrive and beg Gulliver to come immediately to the palace, where the Empress's apartment is on fire. Gulliver puts the fire out by urinating on the palace. It is an offense punishable by death for anyone to urinate in the palace grounds. The Emperor promises Gulliver a pardon, which, however, does not arrive. Gulliver hears that the Empress is so offended by his action that she has moved into another part of the palace, ordering that the apartments on which Gulliver urinated must never be repaired.
Chapter VI
	Gulliver describes Lilliput. Everything, including trees and livestock, is tiny, in proportion with the people. He goes on to describe some of the customs of the Lilliputians. Some he views as absurd, such as their practice of burying their dead with their heads downward, because they believe that by the time of the resurrection, the earth will have turned upside down, and thus the dead will be standing on their feet. Other customs seem more valuable, such as their harsh treatment of those informers who falsely denounce an innocent man. If the accused makes his innocence clear in court, the informer is put to death and his estate is used to compensate the innocent person. Fraud is considered to be worse than theft, as honest people have no defense against deceit.
Lilliputians believe that justice should be used not only to punish the guilty but to reward the law-abiding, who are given money and titles of honor. In employing people, they think that good morals are more important than extraordinary ability, since mistakes committed by a virtuous person would never be as serious as fraud committed by a corrupt person.
Atheists are banned from holding public office, since the head of state, the Emperor, draws his authority from God and anyone who disowns that authority cannot make a good servant to the state.
Gullliver adds he is describing the original institutions rather than the current reality, which has degenerated into such corruptions as leaping and creeping.
The education of children is not entrusted to parents, who, it is believed, produce children only as a result of lust. Children of both sexes, except those of laborers, are taken from their parents at an early age and brought up in public nurseries. They are taught virtues such as honor and justice, and are always kept busy. Parents are allowed to visit them only twice a year. Which school a child attends depends on the social status of his or her parents. Children from upper-class families attend different nurseries from those for the children of gentlemen and tradesmen. Upper-class boys continue in education until they are fifteen. Girls from upper-class families have almost the same education as their male counterparts. When the girls are twelve years of age, they are considered ready for marriage and their parents take them home. Boys from trading families are put out to apprenticeships at eleven years old, and girls from such families are apprenticed at nine. Each family pays for its own children's education, as it is not considered fair to give way to one's appetites and conceive children and then expect the burden of looking after them to fall upon the state. However, the fee is graded according to what the family can afford. Laborers keep their children at home, as their business is to cultivate the earth. Old and sick people are looked after in hospitals, and beggars are unknown.
Flimnap has been complaining to the Emperor that Gulliver is costing the Treasury vast sums of money for his keep, and that he should be sent away. Gulliver believes that Flimnap was acting out of jealousy over his wife, who was rumored to have visited Gulliver at his house in secret. Gulliver insists that that her visits were always public and that she always came in company. Though Flimnap and his wife made up their disagreement, he never forgave Gulliver and influenced the Emperor against him.
Analysis
	In this section, Swift satirizes what he sees as the petty differences and disagreements between political parties and religions. The Tramecksan or high heels represent the Tories, and the Slamecksan or low heels represent the Whigs, the two political parties in eighteenth-century England.
Lilliput represents England and Blefescu is France; the Big-Endians are Catholics and the Small-Endians are Protestants. England, in common with the rest of Europe, was originally a Catholic country, viewing the Pope as the spiritual authority. But in the 1520s and 1530s, King Henry VIII of England wanted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, with whom he had been unable to produce an heir, and to marry Anne Boleyn. This episode is referred to in Gulliver's Travels as the Emperor's grandfather cutting his finger while trying to break an egg at the big end. The Pope refused to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine, and in the 1530s Henry broke with Rome and made himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The English Church became progressively more Protestant until Henry's successor, Edward VI, made England officially a Protestant nation. However, conflict between Catholic and Protestant factions in England, and between Protestant England and Catholic France, persisted for centuries.
In reducing the differences between Tories and Whigs, Catholics and Protestants, and England and France, to the trivial level of heel height and manner of breaking eggs, Swift portrays the defining conflicts of English and European history as petty and meaningless. Just as it does not matter how anyone breaks an egg, Swift is suggesting that differences in the ways in which people worship God do not matter, and are not a cause for war.
The episode in Chapter V in which Gulliver urinates on the Empress's apartment to put out a fire, only to be repudiated by her, may be a satirical reference to an incident in his own life. Many critics believe that the urination refers to Swift's publication in 1704 of his satirical work A Tale of a Tub, and that the Empress's disgust at his action refers to Queen Anne of England's disapproval of the work and her subsequent attempt to restrict his career prospects in the Church of England. Swift claimed, both in ""The Apology for the &c."" which is one of his prefaces to A Tale of a Tub, and symbolically in this chapter of Gulliver's Travels, that he wrote the work in order to protect the monarchy against the factions that threatened it.
Chapter VI presents many Lilliputian practices that are presented without the satirical tone of the rest of Part I. Gulliver, and Swift, appear to believe that these are sensible ideas that should be adopted in real society. Many modern readers will agree that it seems fair to treat fraud as a more serious crime than theft, to which many people were driven in Swift's time by poverty, and to educate girls in much the same way as boys (a revolutionary idea in Swift's time). Other ideas are more contentious, such as taking children away from parents and having them brought up in public nurseries. Swift appears to have believed that the only reason that people have children is as an unwanted side-effect of gratifying their sexual appetites. Based on this assumption, he mistrusted parents and did not believe that they were capable of bringing up children well.

Summary
	Chapter VII
	A court official visits Gulliver in secret and warns him that Bolgolam's hostility towards him has increased since Gulliver's success against Blefescu. Bolgolam, Flimnap and several others have conspired to charge Gulliver with crimes punishable by the death penalty. He shows Gulliver a copy of the charges against him. These include charges of high treason for urinating in the palace grounds; acting traitorously by refusing to seize all the Blefescudian ships, reduce that country to a province of the Emperor, and put to death all people who refused to forsake the Big-Endian heresy; and acting traitorously by being friendly to the Blefescudian ambassadors and planning to visit their country even though it has recently been an enemy of Lilliput.
	The official tells Gulliver the story of the debate at court about him. The Emperor is inclined to show mercy on account of the services Gulliver had done him, but Bolgolam and Flimnap insist that Gulliver be put to a painful death by setting fire to his house at night. Reldresal, who claims to be Gulliver's friend, counsels the Emperor to combine mercy with justice by merely putting out his eyes. Bolgolam and the rest of the council disapprove of this suggestion, as the life of a traitor should not be preserved. Bolgolam says that Gulliver may well flood the palace by urinating on it again. He suspects that Gulliver is a secret Big-Endian, and wants him put to death. Flimnap agrees, pointing out the expense of keeping Gulliver.
	The Emperor is against the death penalty for Gulliver. Reldresal suggests that the problem of the expense of keeping Gulliver can be solved by slowly reducing hs diet and starving him to death. They could then cut the flesh from the body and bury it to prevent plagues, leaving the skeleton as a monument to posterity.
	It is decided that the official sentence against Gulliver will be putting out his eyes, and the plan to starve him to death will be secretly implemented. The courtiers expect Gulliver to be grateful for such a lenient sentence, which they intend to carry out by having Gulliver lie on the ground and firing arrows into his eyes. As is the custom after the court decrees any cruel and unjustified execution, the Emperor makes a speech praising his own merciful nature, which is published throughout the kingdom. The people are terrified, as they have noticed that the more lavish these praises, the more inhuman is the punishment, and the more innocent the victim. Gulliver admits that he is a poor judge of such things, but his sentence appears to him rather rigorous. He briefly considers destroying the city, but remembers his oath to the Emperor, and decides he cannot.
	Gulliver decides to escape to Blefescu. He sends a message to Reldresal saying that he has gone to Blefescu in line with his promise and the leave granted him by the Emperor. He takes a warship to carry his belongings and, dragging it behind him, wades and swims to the island. He is received with great honor by the Emperor of Blefescu and the courtiers. Gulliver does not mention his disgrace, feeling justified in this omission by the fact that he has no official knowledge of it.
	Chapter VIII
	Three days after his arrival in Blefescu, Gulliver finds an upturned boat floating in the sea and drags it into the harbor. He explains to the Emperor of Blefescu that fortune has provided the boat to enable him to travel to some place from which he might return to his native land, and asks for permission to leave, which the Emperor grants.
	Gulliver learns later that the Emperor of Lilliput at first is unconcerned over his absence, as he believes that Gulliver has only gone to Blefescu for a short visit in line with his promise. But when time passes and Gulliver does not return, he sends an envoy to Blefescu with a warrant for Gulliver's arrest, conveying to the Emperor of Blefescu that he must tie him up and deport him back to Lilliput, on pain of risking the peace treaty between the nations. The Emperor of Blefescu returns the answer to the Emperor of Lilliput that he cannot do as requested because he owes Gulliver many obligations due to his good service in making the peace. He adds that Gulliver will soon depart, and that both empires will be free from him.
	The Emperor of Blefescu offers Gulliver his protection if he would continue in his service. But Gulliver no longer trusts monarchs or ministers, and politely refuses. The Emperor of Blefescu helps Gulliver fit out his boat and gives him livestock to live off on his journey. Gulliver sets sail and soon encounters an English ship. He recognizes an old friend, Peter Williams, among the crew. When Gulliver tells him something about where he has been, Williams does not believe him, until he shows the miniature cows and sheep that he has been carrying in his pocket.
	Back in England, Gulliver stays just two months with his wife and family before setting off on another sea voyage, the story of which he will tell in the second part of his Travels.
	Analysis
	The satirical focus of this section is the unreliability of the favor of monarchs and their ministers, and their brutality to those whom they deem to be enemies. Though Gulliver has saved the Empress's life, and possibly the entire royal palace and family, by urinating on the fire, she shows no gratitude. Instead, she conspires with Flimnap to have Gulliver sentenced to death for treason. The Emperor and various other courtiers join the conspiracy against him, including Reldresal, who always purported to be Gulliver's friend. Some of Swift's bitterest satire is reserved for this section, in which Reldresal and the Emperor claim to be merciful by suggesting punishments other than death, such as putting out Gulliver's eyes and slowly starving him to death. They even expect Gulliver to be grateful for their leniency. The impression given is that the favor or disfavor of monarchs and governments is arbitrarily earned and lost, without respect to justice or truth. The Emperor (and, by satirical implication, many real-life monarchs) adds to his moral crimes that of hypocrisy: when the court has decreed a particularly unjust execution, he gives speeches praising his own mercy and distributes copies throughout the kingdom. Gulliver the narrator comments, ""nor did any thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his Majesty's mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent"" (Chapter VII). The episode reveals the Emperor, and rulers like him, to be a brutal tyrant masquerading as a compassionate leader.
advertisement
The fact that even the naive Gulliver eventually realizes that rulers and their governments are not to be trusted, conveyed as it is in extremely understated terms (""although I believed him [the Emperor of Blefescu] sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where I could possibly avoid it"" - Chapter VIII), makes the satirical attack stronger. This is because the reader sees the monarch's or minister's betrayal coming before Gulliver catches on, and when it arrives, the reader feels more outrage than the placid Gulliver, as if on his behalf. The righteous anger is therefore taken on by the reader as his or her own, giving it more emotional impact.

Chapter I
	Driven by restlessness, Gulliver sets out on another sea voyage. They land in an unknown country to replenish their store of fresh water. Gulliver walks off alone in search of water, and sees that the rest of the crew are rowing for their lives back to the ship, and huge creature is walking after them. Gulliver runs in the opposite direction. He finds that everything - the hedges, corn, and stiles - is huge. Then he notices some gigantic men carrying reaping hooks. They are about the height of an English church steeple. Gulliver reaches a part of the field where the corn has been laid flat by wind and rain, and finds he cannot make his way through it. He hears the reapers approaching, and fears that he will be killed. He reflects that he is as powerless in this land as he was powerful in Lilliput, simply because of his relative size.
Just as one of the reapers is about to crush him, Gulliver alerts him to his presence by screaming. The man picks him up and takes him to his master, a farmer. The farmer shows Gulliver to his wife, who screams. Gradually, however, she grows very fond of him. They give Gulliver dinner. The farmer's son picks him up by the legs and holds him high in the air, but his father snatches Gulliver from his grasp. The baby of the family treats Gulliver as a plaything and puts him in his mouth before letting him drop, and he is only saved from a broken neck by the farmer's wife. The baby's wet-nurse has to quiet the baby by suckling him. Gulliver describes with disgust the huge size of the nurse's breast.
After dinner, Gulliver is put to bed by the farmer's wife. He needs to relieve himself, but when he gets out of the bed, he is attacked by two rats, and kills one. When the farmer's wife returns, he manages to make her aware of his need to relieve himself, and she takes him out to the garden to do so.
Chapter II
	Gulliver is befriended by the farmer's daughter, whom he calls Glumdalclitch, or ""little nurse."" She names him Grildrig. Gulliver explains that he owes his survival in Brobdingnag to her, but fears that he was the instrument of her disgrace. News soon spreads that the farmer has found a strange creature in his field. One of the farmer's friends comes to see Gulliver and advises the farmer to make some money by exhibiting him on a market day. Glumdalclitch is deeply ashamed of her father's plan, though Gulliver is more philosophical, since even the King of Great Britain, in his situation, would undergo the same treatment.
The farmer puts Gulliver in a box and carries him to the market, where people pay to see him perform. A boy throws a hazelnut at him, and it is so big that it narrowly misses killing him. Gulliver has to entertain spectators for eight hours, and as the farmer continues to exhibit him at his home, he becomes exhausted. Finding that he can make a large profit out of Gulliver, the farmer decides to exhibit Gulliver all over the country, and sets off on a tour with him. Glumdalclitch accompanies them and does her best to keep Gulliver comfortable.
Chapter III
	The more money the farmer makes out of Gulliver, the greedier he gets and the harder he pushes him, until Gulliver is reduced to little more than a skeleton. The farmer calculates that Gulliver will die soon and is the more determined to make as much profit as possible before that happens.
One day, a courtier arrives and orders the farmer to take Gulliver to court for the amusement of the Queen. The Queen takes a liking to Gulliver and buys him from the farmer for a thousand gold pieces. Gulliver requests that Glumdalclitch might be admitted into the Queen's service, and that she can continue to look after him. The Queen agrees. The King invites three scholars to work out exactly what kind of creature Gulliver is. After much debate, they can only conclude that he is a ""lusus naturae,"" or joke of nature. When Gulliver explains to the scholars that he come from a land where there are many others like him, and where everything is in proportion, they smile contemptuously and do not believe him. The King, however, is more intelligent than the scholars, and after questioning the farmer, is inclined to believe Gulliver. The Queen has a house and clothes made for him, and becomes so attached to him that she cannot dine without him.
The King questions Gulliver about the religion, politics, and laws of Europe, and Gulliver explains as well as he can, including giving an account of the schisms in religion and the state. The King laughs and reflects on the ridiculousness of human vanity and pride, which is so potent a force even among people of Gulliver's size, who are to Brobdingnagians as small and as insignificant as insects. Gulliver admits that after spending some time amid people of such great size, he himself would be amused to see a group of English lords and ladies, strutting about in their finery. He even thinks that he himself looks ridiculous when place next to the Queen, so small is he.
The Queen's dwarf takes a malicious delight in finding someone smaller than himself to bully, and drops Gulliver in a bowl of cream. He is saved by Glumdalclitch.
Gulliver is much bothered by flies, which leave behind piles of excrement that are obvious to him, though the Brobdingnagians cannot see them.
Analysis
	""I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian would be among us."" (Part II, Chapter I)
Relative size and significance is a major satirical theme of Gulliver's Travels. Size confers power, so while Gulliver is powerful in Lilliput, he is utterly powerless in Brobdingnag. Without the benefit of such a comparison, however, it is easy for a race or nation to delude itself about how much power and significance it has. The Lilliputians are in the habit of thinking of themselves as very important, though Gulliver could easily crush them. Swift's satirical point is that however important or powerful any group of human beings believes itself to be - including his own contemporaries - they are insignificant in the greater scheme of things, as the arrival of any person or force stronger than them will show. Power is shown to be relative and contingent upon circumstances. This theme is a well-aimed cautionary message to Swift's English contemporaries. England had joined with Scotland in 1707 to form the new state of Great Britain. The new kingdom was the major power in Europe, due to its success in trade, its military capability, and the size of its fleet. It treated the rest of the world with an arrogance corresponding to its strength. That Swift's sympathies lay not with the great power but with the victims of power is clear throughout Gulliver's Travels.
In Chapter III, Swift warns of the insubstantial and relative nature of power through his mouthpiece, the King of Brobdingnag. After Gulliver explains to him about the schisms in European religion and politics, ""he observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I."" The conservative Gulliver is predictably embarrassed to hear ""our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated,"" but the reader cannot miss Swift's point, which is to puncture the vanity and pride of the puffed-up, arrogant English and Europeans.
Brobdingnag gives Gulliver ample range to convey his disgust at the functions and appearance of the human body when seen in magnified scale. In Chapter I, Gulliver is repulsed by the sight of the vast breast of the wet-nurse who looks after the baby. The sight makes Gulliver reflect that female bodies only appear beautiful because people cannot see them in such detail. The effect of such observations is to banish human vanity. They also make the point that anything, when examined in close enough detail, reveals imperfections that may not be visible to man's imperfect senses. Swift lived in an age that was making rapid advances in microscopy, and books were being published with illustrations of insects, organisms, and other substances that had never been seen in such detail before.
Despite Gulliver's disgust at the magnified human functions of the Brobdingnagians, their large size reflects their moral stature, which is greater than Gulliver's. Gulliver lies to the king of Brobdingnag out of pride, in order to make England seem better than it is; he is a hypocrite. Most Brobdingnagians are honest people, and this honesty is enshrined in their leadership and government. This is in contrast with England, where the worst vices of the people are built into the government. The Brobdingnagians' morality is also seen in the fact that they do not use their size to exploit and destroy smaller and weaker people. An exception is the farmer, who is prepared to let Gulliver die to make him more profit. This episode is one of Swift's frequent pleas for compassion for the underdog. As a native of Ireland, which for centuries was under the domination of England and later Great Britian, Swift was acutely conscious of the tendency of powerful peoples to oppress the less powerful. Clearly, there can be no more effective way to teach the powerful compassion and humility than for them to spend some time as the underdog, as Gulliver does in Brobdingnag.
Swift targets the pretensions of supposedly learned scholars in the characters of the three scholars who debate as to what sort of creature he could be. They are determined not to believe the most convenient source of information about him, which is Gulliver himself.
The best idea that they can come up with is that he is one of nature's jokes. On one level, this reveals Swift's conviction of the stupidity of some highly educated people. But on another level, Swift is suggesting that the whole of humanity is one of nature's jokes. Gulliver and people of his size may be tempted to view the relatively tiny Lilliputians as nature's jokes, but then in Brobdingnag, it is Gulliver and his race who are the joke. Somewhere else again, it is possible that the huge Brobdingnagians may meet a race of beings who dwarf them, who treat them as insignificant little insects, and who conclude that they are nature's jokes.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Gulliver describes the physical characteristics of the country of Brobdingnag.
	Glumdalclitch takes Gulliver with her on trips to town. He sees beggars with serious and visible diseases such as breast cancer, the magnified sight of which horrifies him.
	Chapter V
	The dwarf continues to bully Gulliver, shaking apples from a tree onto him.
	The Queen's Maids of Honor often invite Glumdalclitch and Gulliver to their apartments, where they strip Gulliver naked and lay him against their breasts. Gulliver is disgusted at the smell emanating from their bodies, which is overwhelming. He recalls that in Lilliput, after taking exercise, a Lilliputian had complained that he smelt strongly.
	Gulliver is taken to see a public execution, which is a horrific sight, as the arteries spurt blood forty feet into the air.
	The Queen has a tiny boat made for Gulliver, and she and her ladies entertain themselves with watching him sail it in a trough.
	One day, a monkey seizes Gulliver and carries him up onto a roof. Some men pursue the monkey, who drops Gulliver. The King discusses the episode with Gulliver, who says that if he had thought to make use of his sword, he would have wounded the monkey and frightened him away. The King only laughs at him, and everyone else joins in. Gulliver reflects that it is hopeless to try to preserve one's honor when in the company of those who are not his equals. And yet, he thinks, he has often seen contemptible people in England presume that they are important.
	Glumdalclitch takes Gulliver for a walk in the country, and he falls in a pile of cow dung. Though Glumdalclitch loves Gulliver, she makes the most of any story that she thinks might amuse the Queen, and the story is passed around the court, to the amusement of everyone.
	Chapter VI
	Gulliver uses some combings of the Queen's hair to make a pair of miniature chairs as a present for her.
	The King, whom Gulliver describes as ""a prince of excellent understanding,"" asks him to describe the government of England in detail, hoping that he might learn of something that can benefit his own country. Gulliver tells him about the two chambers of Parliament, the House of Lords and House of Commons, and about the Courts of Justice. The King asks penetrating questions about these institutions, such as how the nobility who are destined for the House of Lords are educated, and whether new lords are sometimes chosen for dishonorable reasons, such as favoritism, bribes, or for the purpose of strengthening a party opposite to the public interest. He asks whether the lords are so free from avarice that bribes cannot influence them, and whether the bishops chosen to sit in the House of Lords are promoted on account of the holiness of their lives, or because they servilely follow the opinions of some nobleman who employed them before their elevation to the Lords.
	The King asks about how members of the House of Commons are elected. He wants to know whether votes can be bought; he asks why people want so much to be members of the Commons when they receive no salary, and wonders if it is because they are ready to sacrifice the public good in return for illicit rewards from a corrupt monarch and ministers.
	The King asks about the Courts of Justice. He asks whether lawyers are allowed to plead in causes known to be unjust or oppressive; whether lawyers and judges are well educated in justice or merely in local or national customs; and whether lawyers or judges have any part in writing the laws which they later interpret (thereby opening up a potential conflict of interest).
	Next, the King turns his attention to England's management of its treasury. He cannot understand how a government can be so imprudent as to spend more than its income, and why it should engage in such costly and frequent wars. He believes that the English must be unusually quarrelsome, or that they must have unusually bad neighbors. He cannot grasp what business England has sending a military presence to other countries, unless it be to protect trade or to honor a treaty. Regarding England's warring factions in religion and politics, he believes that people should be allowed to hold opinions contrary to the public good in religion and politics, as long as they do not try to spread them.
	The King inquires into the nobility's habit of gambling. He is concerned about its negative effects on their minds and finances.
	Responding to Gulliver's account of the history of England, the King is horrified by what appears to be a heap of conspiracies, rebellions, and murders, driven by avarice, cruelty, rage, or ambition.
	The King ends by saying that it is clear that in English law, legislators can be full of vice, and that there are conflicts of interest that pervert the course of justice. Men are promoted for reasons other than their worth, and priests for reasons other than their holiness. Members of Parliament and advisors are not chosen for their love of their country or their wisdom. He concludes in Chapter VI that Gulliver's fellow men are a wicked and odious race.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver, a patriot, feels hurt at the King's damning judgment of his ""noble and beloved country."" To justify himself from possible censure from his readers, he points out that if anything, he exaggerated the positive in his account of England's government, and hid as many of the faults as he could. He hopes that his readers will make allowances for the King, as someone who has lived secluded from the rest of the world, and who is unfamiliar with the customs of other nations. He gives an example of the King's narrow-mindedness. Gulliver once tried to gain the King's favor by offering to teach him the method of making gunpowder, which is unknown in Brobdingnag, after describing its lethal effects in warfare. The King is horrified at such an inhumane idea. Although he is generally delighted by new discoveries, he does not wish to know such a secret, and commands Gulliver never to mention it again.
	Gulliver marvels at the King's lack of vision in turning down the opportunity to be master of the lives and fortunes of his people. He gives another example of the King's narrow principles: he cannot understand why the English should have produced so many books about the art of government, when governing was simply about justice and common sense.
	Gulliver describes the education of Brobdingnagians as ""defective."" They excel in morality, poetry, history, and mathematics, though they only apply this last discipline to improving agriculture and the mechanical arts. The number of laws in their country is not allowed to exceed the number of letters in their alphabet, and they are expressed in such clear language that interpretation is not in doubt. They know how to print, but do not have many books. One book suggests that Brobdingnagians were once much larger than they are now.
	Chapter VIII
	The King has given orders that any ship like the one in which Gulliver arrived should be sighted near the coast, it should be brought ashore and all the passengers taken to the capital city, Lorbrulgrud. The King wishes to find a mate for Gulliver, so that the couple can propagate the race. But though Gulliver feels he has been treated kindly in Brobdingnag, he is unwilling to create progeny who will be kept in cages like canaries and sold to people as curiosities. He wants to return to his native land.
	Gulliver has been in the country for two years when he and Glumdalclitch accompany the Queen on a progress. At the journey's end, Glumdalclitch and Gulliver are ill, and Gulliver persuades her to allow a pageboy to take him to the seaside for some fresh air. At the seashore, the boy leaves Gulliver sleeping in his box and goes off hunting for birds' eggs. Suddenly, a bird picks up Gulliver's box and flies off with it. The bird lets the box drop into the sea. For four hours, Gulliver is adrift in the ocean. Then, he feels the box being pulled along. A voice tells him the box is tied to a ship and that a carpenter will come and cut it open. Gulliver says that someone can simply put his finger into the ring on top of the box and haul it out of the sea. He hears laughter and realizes that he is among people of his own size.
	The carpenter arrives and cuts a hole in the box. A weakened Gulliver is brought onto the ship. It takes Gulliver some time to get used to the relatively small size of the people. He tells the captain his story, and shows him some things he has brought with him from Brobdingnag.
	Back in England, Gulliver is reunited with his wife, who tells him that he should never go to sea again.
	Analysis
	The conversation between Gulliver and the King covers many injustices and corruptions in the English governmental system and the judiciary. Many of these are still current in the early twenty-first century (witness the ""cash for honors"" scandal of 2006, when England's prime minister Tony Blair stands accused of selling positions in the House of Lords in return for undisclosed loans to the ruling Labour Party). As ever, Gulliver is presented as a na�ve reporter, and if anything, his views are colored by patriotism. The King is partly motivated in his questioning by an earnest desire to learn something that could be implemented in his own country for the benefit of the people. In addition, Gulliver's unopposed view of the King as ""a prince of excellent understanding,"" along with the King's incisive investigation into the government of England, alert the reader to Swift's intention that the King's famous conclusion should be taken seriously. Hence his severe judgment on what he sees as the abuses and corruption of England's government carries great satirical force. He pronounces, ""I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.""
	Gulliver's indignant response to the King's judgment reinforces the satirical purpose. His insistence that he exaggerated the positive in his account of England's government tells the reader that if he had told the complete truth, the King would have been even harsher in his conclusion. Gulliver is exposed as overly proud of his native country, which makes him dishonest and a hypocrite.
	Gulliver's supposed illustration of the King's narrow-mindedness in refusing to learn the destructive secret of gunpowder merely confirms to the reader the justice of the King's opinion of mankind as ""pernicious"" and ""odious."" In fact, the King's response is humane and morally responsible, but Gulliver can only see it as weakness. This is an example of dramatic irony, when the reader understands something to which a character (in this case, Gulliver) is blind.

The Brobdingnagians are portrayed as having a more highly developed moral sense than Gulliver and his kind, and than the Lilliputians. Brobdingnagian society is not perfect, and the people do have vices, as, for example, the farmer's greed in exploiting Gulliver for profit. But unlike England, Brobdingnag has not incorporated the vices of individuals into government and law. The nation is fortunate in having a wise king, who has ensured that his wisdom will not pass away with him but is enshrined in laws and customs.

131,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part III Chapters I-III,"Summary
Chapter I
	Gulliver's desire to see the world and a financially lucrative offer prevails over his wife's pleas for him not to go to sea again, and he sets off on another voyage as ship's surgeon. His ship is boarded by pirates. Gulliver expects mercy from the Dutch pirate as he is a fellow Christian and Protestant, but it is the ""heathen"" Japanese pirate who shows more humanity, telling Gulliver that he will not die. The Dutch pirate is furious and sets Gulliver adrift in a canoe with meager rations, which the Japanese pirate augments. Gulliver sails to an island and sets up home in a cave.
The next day, Gulliver sees a large body about two miles high moving towards the island. As it draws closer, he notices that there are people moving up and down the sides of it and galleries and stairs built onto it. Gulliver shouts to them and they draw him up onto the flying island.
Chapter II
	Gulliver reflects that these are a strange-looking people, with heads leaning to one side and one eye turned inward, while the other looks upward. Their clothes are decorated with images of planets and musical instruments. The servants carry a bladder full of dried peas, with which they strike the mouths and ears of those around them. Gulliver discovers that the people are so preoccupied with intense speculations that they cannot speak or listen without first being roused by the flapper. Indeed, they repeatedly forget about Gulliver's presence and have to be reminded by the flappers.
Gulliver is taken to see the King of the island, called Laputa. The King is surrounded by globes and mathematical instruments, and is so preoccupied that he fails to notice Gulliver and his other visitors for an hour. When the King addresses Gulliver, a servant flaps his ear. When Gulliver points out that he does not need such attention, the people think he is weak-minded.
The Laputans give Gulliver dinner. All the food is cut into geometrical shapes. Gulliver is taught their language. A tailor arrives, measures his body precisely with mathematical instruments, and later delivers a suit of ill-fitting clothes.
The King orders that the island should be floated over towns and villages on the mainland so that he can receive his subjects' petitions.
The Laputans view everything in mathematical and musical concepts, so that they describe the beauty of a woman in terms of geometrical shapes or musical terminology. However, they despise practical geometry, so that there are no right angles in their houses, which are badly built. Though they are experts in drawing diagrams, they are impractical and cannot grasp any subject other than mathematics or music. They are also fond of debating politics in minute detail. They are obsessed by the movements of the celestial bodies, and live in perpetual fear that one will destroy them. The women of the island have no patience with their husbands and exploit their absent-mindedness by having affairs right under their noses. The women are only allowed to go to the mainland by special permission of the King, since many who leave do not return. The prime minister's wife once went to the mainland and hid for months, preferring to live in rags with a deformed footman who beat her than to return to her husband.
Chapter III
	Gulliver describes the physical characteristics of the island. The King is able to order that the island be raised above the level of clouds, so he can control how much rain the island receives. In the center of the island is a cave called the Astronomer's Cave, filled with astronomical instruments. Here too is a giant loadstone (magnet) which is manipulated in order to steer the island to different parts of the King's realm. The limitations of the technology of the loadstone means that the island cannot move beyond the extent of the realm, and neither can it rise above four miles.
The Laputans have better telescopes than are known in Europe, by which they see many more stars.
If a town rebels against the King or refuses to pay his taxes, he has two ways of reducing it to obedience. He can either float the island above the region, shutting out the sun and rain, or arrange for it to be pelted with rocks. If these methods do not work, he can drop the island on the town and crush the buildings and inhabitants. The Kings of this country have always been reluctant to do this, as the island could get damaged. Thus they drop the island on the people gently, out of a pretext of tenderness for them.
One rebellious city used their own magnet to try to force the island to descend in their midst, planning to kill the King and change the government. It took the King eight months to realize that the city was in rebellion, whereupon he ordered the island to hover above it and deprive it of rain and sun. The people had laid up provisions, so this did not work. The King then ordered them to be pelted with rocks, but they took refuge in strong towers. The King's technical advisors realized that if the island were to descend on the city, it would be trapped. The King was forced to give in to the city's demands.
By law, the King and his family are confined to the island.
Analysis
	Gulliver's stay in Laputa explores a different aspect of power from his stay in Lilliput or Brobdingnag. In Laputa, power is conferred not by superior size, but by technological knowledge, which becomes the instrument of oppression of the people. The Laputans have highly specialized knowledge of magnets that enables the King to dominate his realm from the relative safety of an island. He is remote from his subjects - it takes him eight months to realize that a city is in rebellion - so he does not understand their needs. Nevertheless, his control of the technology of the loadstone means that he holds the power of life or death over his subjects. The rebellious city regains some of its power by mastering the same technology that controls the King's island.
The Laputans' physical appearance reinforces the notion of their remoteness from the people living on the mainland. They have one eye turned inwards and the other heavenwards, and have to be roused with a flapper in order to speak or listen to another person. These characteristics symbolically reflect their lack of engagement with humanity and preoccupation with abstract thought. The custom of the flappers is deliberately ludicrous, emphasizing the foolishness and impracticality of the Laputans' outlook on life. It is significant that the island can only move within the limits of the King's domain and it can rise no higher than four miles: the same technology that gives the Laputans such power over the people also imprisons them within a restricted range. Mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, the Laputans are limited. They have no interests outside music (which they spend hours playing, to the exclusion of doing anything else), astronomy (which causes them only fear of cosmic accidents),
and mathematics (though they disdain the practical application of mathematics that would enable them to make clothes that fit or buildings that stand).
This section is Swift's satirical comment on the excesses of abstract thought and theoretical science that characterized the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment. In Laputa, humanity and practical considerations are sacrificed in pursuit of a cold intellectualism. The advanced technology that drives the island is not shared with the people to liberate them, but is used to enslave them.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Though Gulliver is not mistreated by the Laputans, they regard him with contempt because of his inferior understanding of music and mathematics. He finds them tedious companions and obtains permission from the King of Laputa to leave. He is let down into the capital city (called Lagado) of the mainland, a country called Balnibarbi, and takes a letter of introduction from the King of Laputa to the man who is to be his host, a lord called Munodi. Munodi takes Gulliver on a tour of the country. Gulliver sees miserable people in rags, buildings in disrepair, and workers in the fields, but no sign that they are producing any crops. Munodi takes Gulliver to his country estate, where the land is well cultivated and productive, and the house is beautifully built. He tells Gulliver that he may soon be forced to tear down his house and rebuild it according to Laputan standards, and to destroy his crops, if he is not to offend the King.
	Munodi explains what happened to the country. Forty years ago some people went up to Laputa and came back determined to reform the arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics. Academies to teach the new ideas were set up in most towns. In these academies, professors would invent new methods whereby, for example, one man could do the work of ten. None of the new methods worked; the land and country went to ruin; and the people are without food or clothes. Munodi and a few other gentry are not of an enterprising spirit: they continue to live in the houses their ancestors built, and to do things in the old and tried ways, but are disapproved of as ignorant and selfish. Munodi encourages Gulliver to visit the Academy, and Gulliver enthusiastically takes him up on the suggestion.
	Chapter V
	Gulliver visits the Academy of Lagado. He meets an inventor who is working on a project to extract sunbeams out of cucumbers in order to supply the Governor's gardens. He thinks he may have some success in eight years' time. He begs Gulliver to give him money because cucumbers are expensive. Gulliver has been supplied with money for the purpose by Munodi, who is familiar with the academicians' habit of begging.
	Another inventor is working on ways of reverse-engineering excrement into food. Another is trying to find a way of making spiders weave fabric of different colors by feeding them colored flies; yet another, a physician, tries to cure patients by blowing air up the anus. While Gulliver watches, he tries the technique on a dog, which dies.
	A professor is trying to teach his students to improve knowledge using a machine that rearranges words. He speculates that new books could be written in this way on many subjects without the need for intelligence or study. He intends to give the world a new body of arts and sciences, but believes the public should fund the project.
	At the school of languages, professors are working on shortening conversations by cutting out polysyllables and verbs, since only nouns are needed. The also have a project to abolish words altogether, as they believe that every word spoken shortens the life. Since words are names for things, an idea came up for men to carry about the objects that they need to express their purpose, but the women rebelled and quashed the project.
	At the mathematical school, a master is trying to teach mathematical proofs by writing them on wafers that are fed to the students.
	Chapter VI
	Gulliver feels depressed by what he has seen. The professors seem to him to be out of their minds. The people are pressing for an end to this senseless regime. They want the monarchs to choose favorites based on their wisdom and abilities; and they want the ministers to consult the public good.
	Gulliver meets a doctor who believes that government is like the individual physical body, in that both suffer from the same diseases. He proposes to take the pulse of each politician after a debate and administer a suitable medicine to each in order to shorten debates and calm conflict. Also, because the favorites of monarchs have bad memories, whoever addresses the chief minister should tweak him by the nose or tread on his corns, to prevent forgetfulness.
	Gulliver hears a debate between two professors about how to raise taxes without being unpopular. One idea is to tax every man's vice and folly, to be judged by his neighbors. Another is to allow people to set a taxable value on themselves according to how much wit, valor, and charm they possess: the more of these qualities they claim to have, the higher the tax they should pay. Virtues such as justice and honor, however, would not be taxed, as no man will allow that any other man has them, nor will he value them in himself.
	Gulliver finds the idea of staying in Lagado unattractive, and wants to return to England.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver wants to travel to Luggnagg, as from there he will be able to travel to Japan and thence to Europe. No ship will be ready for a month, so while he is waiting, he takes a trip to the island of Glubbdubdribb, which means the Island of Magicians. Gulliver meets the Governor, who has the power of calling up and dismissing attendants from the spirit world. The Governor gives Gulliver the chance to call up and question whomever he likes from among the dead. Gulliver chooses Alexander the Great, who tells him that he did not die of poison, but of excessive drinking.
	Chapter VIII
	Gulliver has the Governor call up the ancient Greek poet Homer and the philosopher Aristotle. He also arranges a visit from the French philosophers Ren� Descartes and Pierre Gassendi, whom he asks to explain their systems to Aristotle. Aristotle freely acknowledges his mistakes and explains that systems of explaining nature vary from age to age. Gulliver then questions a number of famous people from history, and finds that historians have misled posterity with lies. He also notes that wicked people have been promoted to positions of trust and responsibility, and that whores and parasites have influenced events. Conversely, Gulliver sees some virtuous people who have done good service to monarchs or countries, but who died in poverty and who were condemned as traitors by historians. By observing the ancestors of noble families, Gulliver is able to see how syphilis, once it has been introduced into the family line, causes each subsequent generation to degenerate.
	Chapter IX
	Gulliver travels to Luggnagg, where he is confined despite his desire to go to England. He is summoned by the King of Luggnagg. It is the custom at court for subjects to lick the floor, and the King gets rid of his enemies by strewing the floor with poison. The King is delighted with Gulliver, and arranges for him to stay at court for three months.
	Chapter X
	The Luggnaggians tell Gulliver about a sort of people among them who can never die. They are called Struldbrugs, or Immortals, and are distinguished by being born with a red spot on the forehead. Gulliver is envious, and arranges to meet them. One man asks Gulliver what he would do with his life if he were immortal. Gulliver, who has often mused on the subject, says that he would be the wealthiest, wisest, and most learned person in the kingdom, and he would become a great teacher of men, with the aim of preventing corruption in the world.
	The Luggnaggians laugh at him, and point out that though most humans think they desire immortality, Luggnaggians do not share the delusion, from the example of the Struldbrugs. Immortality, they explain, is not a matter of eternal youth and vigor, but an endless period of being afflicted with all the disorders of age. The Struldbrugs are like ordinary humans until they are about thirty, and thereafter become more depressed. They are incapable of affection or friendship. Their marriages are dissolved at the age of eighty, ""For the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned without any fault of their own to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife."" Also at eighty, their heirs immediately inherit their estate, with a small amount being held back to sustain them. By ninety, they have lost their memory, teeth, hair, and senses. Gulliver meets a few Struldbrugs, who appear to have no interest in anything and to be miserable. Gulliver loses his appetite for immortality.
	Chapter XI
	Gulliver refuses the King of Luggnagg's offer of employment and travels to Japan. From there, he travels to England, where he finds that his wife and family are well.
	Analysis
	In the character of Munodi, a man of sense in a senseless land, and in Gulliver's visit to the Academy, Swift continues to satirize the absurd pursuit of theoretical and abstract knowledge at the expense of common sense and practicality. While Munodi sticks to old and proven systems of architecture and agriculture, and as a result has a beautiful house and productive land, he is much disapproved of in the state, and faces being forced to destroy it in the name of ideology. The academicians, on the other hand, think up endless ingenious but pointless projects and are determined to reform systems that had worked very well before their meddling, while the people starve for lack of food.
advertisement
This section also presents Swift's views on why immortality is not a desirable state. The Struldbrugs do not grow in wisdom with old age, but become more incapable and less loving.
	Gulliver's meeting with famous historical figures raised from the spirit world gives Swift an opportunity to satirize what he saw as the lies of historians. History, he points out, is written by fallible people and is not impartial. The episode draws upon the Italian poet Dante Alighieri's fourteenth-century poem, ""Inferno,"" in which he travels through hell and sees sinners being punished.
",Gulliver's Travels
133,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part IV Chapters I-III,"Summary
Chapter I
	Gulliver spends five months at home with his wife, and she is pregnant when he leaves to go to sea once more, this time as captain of a ship. Many of his crew die of illness and he is forced to recruit more. These turn out to be pirates who influence the rest of the crew to mutiny. They leave Gulliver on the shore of a strange country. As Gulliver begins to explore, he sees some strange, deformed creatures with goat-like beards and a ridge of hair down their backs and on part of their legs. They have long claws, which they use to climb trees. Gulliver is repulsed by the creatures' ugliness. When he meets one on his path, he strikes it with the flat of his sword. The beast roars, and many of its fellows flock to join it, climbing into trees and defecating on Gulliver.
Suddenly, they all run away, and Gulliver notices that a horse has arrived. The horse inspects Gulliver and neighs several times in different cadences. Another horse arrives, and the two seem to confer. They appear to be very rational creatures, so much so that Gulliver assumes they are magicians who have transformed themselves into horses. Gulliver asks the horses to take him to a house or village. The horses seem to use two words: ""Yahoo,"" and ""Houyhnhnm,"" which Gulliver learns to say. One horse leaves, and the other leads Gulliver off.
Chapter II
	The horse leads Gulliver to a house, in which several horses are sitting and going about domestic business. Gulliver reflects that if the animals here are so advanced, the human beings who civilized them must be the wisest in the world. One of the mares looks at him with contempt and says the word ""Yahoo"" to the others. He is led into the courtyard, where several of the ugly creatures he saw previously are tied up, eating dead animals. The horses compare Gulliver to these creatures, and Gulliver is shocked to realize that he does resemble them. One horse offers Gulliver some of the food that those creatures eat, which he politely rejects, and some of the horses' hay and oats, which he also rejects. Gulliver points to a cow, and the horses understand his meaning and give him milk to drink.
In this country, the horses ride in carriages drawn by Yahoos. An old horse arrives in one of these vehicles to dine with Gulliver and the horses. They try to work out what Gulliver will eat, and he suggests that they bring him some of their oats, from which he makes bread. He is given a place to sleep on straw.
Gulliver is to spend three years in this country.
Chapter III
	Gulliver learns the language of the horses, or Houyhnhnms, as their race is called. They ask him where he came from. When he tells them that he came in a boat from beyond the sea, they cannot believe that such things are possible. They are puzzled by Gulliver, as though he resembles the Yahoos, he is more teachable and rational than they. Gulliver begs them not to call him a Yahoo, as he feels utter contempt for those creatures, and they agree.
Analysis
	While Gulliver feels only disgust at the Yahoos' uncivilized behavior and tries to distance himself from them, it is clear that they are disturbingly close to humans in their nature. The rational Houyhnhnms carefully compare Gulliver with the Yahoos tethered in their yard and cannot easily tell the difference. When they see Gulliver naked, the only differences they note are that he has less hair and shorter claws, and walks on his hind legs. The similarity is underlined by Gulliver's unguarded comment in Chapter II that prefaces his judgment on ""those filthy Yahoos"": he says, ""there were few greater lovers of mankind, at that time, than myself."" This comment assumes that the Yahoos are essentially part of mankind. Pathetically, Gulliver clings to his clothes as one of the few proofs of his difference from the Yahoos he despises. Clothes are not an intrinsic part of humanity, but an addition that man has adopted in part as protection from shame about his body, a shame that the enlightened Houyhnhnms cannot comprehend.
Swift's satirical purpose in Part IV is assisted by his reversal of the usual roles of humans and horses in normal society. Gulliver is used to seeing horses serve humans, for instance, by pulling carriages. But in this land, horses ride in carriages pulled by human-like Yahoos, who act as the servants to the horses. In making the horses the rational creatures and the Yahoos ignorant and brutish, Swift is drawing attention to the baser aspects of human nature. He does not make this distinction clear from the beginning, having Gulliver mislead the reader by at first putting forward the idea that the horses are transformed magicians.
Swift gradually allows the reader to realize along with Gulliver, and through his eyes, that here, the horses are in charge of the Yahoos because they are the more advanced species.
Part IV represents a shift in the structure of Gulliver's Travels, which up to this point has shown Gulliver as too large, too small, or too practical for the societies he visits. In this country, he stands out because he is not rational enough. Swift is preparing the reader for his most severe condemnation of mankind.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Gulliver explains that the Yahoos are the governing creatures in his country, a fact that the Houyhnhnms struggle to comprehend. Gulliver goes on to describe how the horses are fed and groomed, and how Yahoo servants are employed to look after them. The Houyhnhnms comment that whatever Gulliver claims about the subservient role of horses in his country, it is clear that in reality, the horses are the masters there too. But when Gulliver explains that horses owned by tradesmen are subjected to drudgery, the Houyhnhnms wonder how such a weak animal as a Yahoo can ride upon a Houyhnhnm, since it would be easy for the Houyhnhnm to throw off the Yahoo. Gulliver says that the horses are trained to accept human domination and are beaten if they disobey.
	Gulliver tells the Houyhnhnms the story of his life and how he came to their land. The Houyhnhnms find it difficult to understand the vices of the piratical crew members of the ship on which Gulliver arrived.
	Chapter V
	Gulliver tells his Houyhnhnm master about how society in England is organized, and the war between England and France. The Houyhnhnm asks about the causes of war in Gulliver's society. Gulliver says that sometimes, monarchs feel that they do not have enough land or people to govern; in other cases, wars are pursued to distract the citizens of a country from the evils of the government. Causes of war include differences of opinion, such as the views of Catholics and Protestants about whether the bread and wine used in the holy communion ritual are in reality the flesh and blood of Christ, or symbolic of it. Gulliver says it is considered justifiable to invade a country after it has been weakened by famine or civil unrest. If the people of the conquered country are poor and ignorant, it is thought acceptable to enslave them in order to civilize them. It is also considered acceptable for the leader of a country that helps another country drive out an invader to seize the country for himself.
	The Houyhnhnm says that it is lucky that nature has designed Gulliver's type of Yahoo in such a way that they are incapable of doing much harm to each other; their mouths and claws are unfit for fighting. Gulliver smiles at his ignorance and describes the weapons and ammunition that are used in war, including gunpowder, pistols, and cannons. With these, he explains, it is possible to blow up a hundred enemies at once. The Houyhnhnm is disturbed. He does not blame the Yahoos of his own country for their brutal behavior, as that is their nature, but he can see no excuse for a creature ""pretending to reason"" to act thus.
	The Houyhnhnm asks Gulliver to explain what he meant when he said that some of his ship's crew left England as a result of being ruined by law. Law, the Houyhnhnm points out, is meant to sustain life, not destroy it. Gulliver explains the abuses of law in human society. He says a lawyer is a person who is paid to argue that white is black and black is white, and who is more skilled at defending falsehood than justice. It is held among lawyers that any decision that has been made by a court in the past may be made again (the rule of precedent), however unjust it may be. Lawyers use a jargon that no one else can understand. They have encouraged the proliferation and over-complexity of laws. This serves their interest, as it can take years, and correspondingly large legal fees, to settle a case. In the cases of alleged crimes against the state, the judge first finds out the government's view, and passes sentence accordingly.
	Chapter VI
	The Houyhnhnm cannot understand what could motivate lawyers to injure their fellow humans. Gulliver explains the concept of money, which the Houyhnhnms do not have. Money, Gulliver says, enables a Yahoo to buy the finest properties, clothes, and foods, and to have his choice of the most beautiful women. In sum, no Yahoo thinks he has enough of it. He says that for every rich man, there are a thousand poor, and the rich live off the labor of the poor. When Gulliver remarks that the ingredients for rich people's meals have to be transported around the globe, the Houyhnhnm says that England must be very miserable if it cannot be self-sufficient in food. Gulliver says that on the contrary, England produces three times as much food as its inhabitants could consume, but most is exported in return for imports of luxury goods that satisfy the greed and vice of wealthy people. An example is wine, which only serves to create illness and early death.
	Gulliver finds it difficult to explain illness to the Houyhnhnm, as it is unknown in their society. The Houyhnhnm says that nature, which works all things to perfection, cannot allow disease to take hold of the body. Gulliver tells him that humans abuse their bodies through harmful habits that disrupt digestion. He says that they acquire syphilis from sexual relations with prostitutes, and that the disease is passed down through generations. Gulliver goes on to detail the frequently destructive medical armory of the doctors of his time, including purgatives and emetics. Some diseases, he says, are imaginary, and the doctors have invented imaginary cures for them. In the case of serious diseases, the doctors predict death, and are proved correct, since while they cannot cure the patient, they can always kill him with toxic medicine. Many doctors are employed as poisoners by people who have wearied of their spouses.
	Gulliver describes the qualities needed in a chief minister in the government (the equivalent of the modern prime minister or president of a country). The most important quality is hypocrisy. For example, if the candidate publicly attacks the corruption of the court, the monarch will choose him as chief minister because he knows that such zealots always prove most subservient. The minister preserves himself in power by bribing Members of Parliament. He is able to remain unaccountable to the public because of an Act of Parliament (the Act of Indemnity) that makes him immune to prosecution, and he retires laden with wealth that he has stolen from the nation.
	The Houyhnhnm feels sure that Gulliver must have been born into a noble family, because he is cleaner and better-looking than most of his fellow Yahoos. Gulliver corrects him, pointing out that he misunderstands the concept of nobility as it exists in England. There, young noblemen are brought up to be idle and end up marrying an unhealthy and unpleasant woman for her money. So weak and diseased is the nobility that if a nobleman is healthy and robust, he is suspected of being the illegitimate offspring of a groom or coachman. Yet such nobles, in Parliament's House of Lords, have the power to decide the laws of the nation.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver defends himself against possible accusations that he is representing humankind too honestly to the Houyhnhnms, who are predisposed by their familiarity with Yahoos to a negative opinion of humans. He confesses that living among the Houyhnhnms has inspired in him such love and respect for them that he has no wish to return to human society. Nevertheless, he feels that he has portrayed his own society to the Houyhnhnms in as positive a light as he could.
	Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master gives his verdict on Gulliver's fellow man, saying that although he seems to be endowed with a pittance of reason, he only misuses it to corrupt himself. In addition, man appears to lack those natural abilities that Yahoos possess, such as agility. He adds that man's institutions of government and law plainly lack reason and virtue. He considers that the causes of dissent among Yahoos are the same as among humans, particularly greed, since if a group of Yahoos were given enough food for fifty, each would want to keep it all for himself. Moreover, groups of Yahoos fight their neighbor Yahoos with no cause, and if they lack an external enemy, they fight amongst themselves.
	Yahoos are fond of shiny stones, which they dig up and hoard in their kennels, while worrying constantly lest their fellows should find their treasure. The Houyhnhnm cannot understand the Yahoos obsession with these useless stones, but he believes that their behavior is similar to avarice among humankind. The Houyhnhnm adds that Yahoos are given to consuming a root that intoxicates them, as wine does humans, which makes them either hug or fight one another. Yahoos, like humans, are subject to diseases of excess.
	Each herd of Yahoos has a leader, who is uglier and more mischievous than his fellows, and who is skilled at licking the feet and posterior of his Houyhnhnm master. He is hated by his fellow Yahoos and when he is finally forced from office, the other Yahoos defecate on him. Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master leaves Gulliver to decide whether this relates to human court favorites and government ministers.
	The Houyhnhnm mentions the Yahoo habit of sitting and howling in a corner for no reason. The only remedy is to set the Yahoo to hard work. Gulliver recognizes this as a disease of wealthy and idle Englishmen, which is known as spleen. The Houyhnhnm describes the odd behavior of female Yahoos, which Gulliver recognizes as (in his view) the human female tendencies of flirting, blaming and judging others, and malicious gossip.

	This section of the book marks a change in Gulliver's attitude to his fellow men. While previously, he has assumed a certain superiority to the people around him (who, unnoticed by him, are caricatures of people from his own society), under the influence of the rational Houyhnhnms, he now feels disgust at his own kind. Humans are portrayed as being worse than Yahoos, since Yahoos are not rational and therefore have no choice but to act in a bestial manner, but humans pretend to rationality and therefore have a choice as to how to act. That humans should choose greed, avarice, and hypocrisy over the selfless rationality

exemplified by the Houyhnhnms is shown as morally reprehensible as well as absurd.
	Yahoo qualities that are described in order to satirize human vices include greed, avarice, and an aggression that leads Yahoos to fight their own kind. The flirtatious and malicious behavior of female Yahoos is also calculated to reflect the behavior of female humans. The despicable behavior of leader Yahoos reflects the hypocrisy of government officials in human society.

Summary
	Chapter VIII
	With a servant Houyhnhnm as his guard Gulliver goes to investigate the Yahoos to see whether they are similar to humans. He finds them smelly, unteachable, and cruel. A female Yahoo sees Gulliver naked and leaps upon him in a fit of lust. This convinces Gulliver that he must be a Yahoo, since the females desire him as they would one of their own species.
	Gulliver describes the principles of the Houyhnhnms. They are naturally virtuous, cultivate reason, and have no concept of anything evil. They act with friendship and kindness towards their fellows, and the only factor that makes them give a distinction to any particular Houyhnhnm is if he is unusually virtuous.
	In order to avoid overpopulation, Houyhnhnms only mate to produce one offspring of each sex. Genetically inferior Houyhnhnms, who are destined to be servants, are allowed to breed three offspring of each sex to serve in noble families. They are careful to make matches that preserve the strength and good health of the race as a whole. Courtship and romantic love have no place in the process, but the couple displays the same kindness and respect to each other as to the rest of their race.
	Female Houyhnhnms receive the same education as the males, and they are brought up to behave virtuously. All Houyhnhnms receive physical education to make them strong and healthy.
	Every four years, the Houyhnhnms hold a council to identify any food shortages in the districts, which are immediately rectified.
	Chapter IX
	A council of the Houyhnhnms is held at which it is discussed whether to exterminate the Yahoos from the face of the earth. The case for extermination is that the Yahoos destroy the Houyhnhnms's crops and steal their milk. They are only useful for carriage, a role that could be performed by asses, which are less troublesome.
	Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master suggests that they could castrate the Yahoos at an early age, as Gulliver's people castrate their horses, to make them tame and to put an end to their race without taking life. Meanwhile the Houyhnhnms could begin to domesticate asses.
	The Houyhnhnms have no written language. However, they are skilled in herbal medicine, practical astronomy, and poetry. Their poetry is geared towards inspiring readers to greater virtue or physical excellence.
	Houyhnhnms (in the absence of accidents) die of old age. Their friends and relatives express neither joy nor grief at their departure, as they believe that death is simply a return to the ""first mother.""
	Houyhnhnms have no word to express anything evil. They describe mistakes or unpleasant events by adding the word ""Yahoo"" to the word or phrase.
	Chapter X
	Gulliver is happy living a simple life among the Houyhnhnms. He dresses in animal skins and is relieved to have no contact with the follies and vices of human society. Gulliver feels privileged to be allowed to listen to the conversation of his Houyhnhnm master, which contains much wisdom. He comes to love and respect the Houyhnhnm race. He thinks of his family, friends, and countrymen as Yahoos. As he feels that he is himself a Yahoo, he is filled with self-disgust.
	One day, Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master summons him and tells him that at the council, the other Houyhnhnms had voiced their disapproval of his keeping a Yahoo (Gulliver) as a member of his family. This was contrary to reason and nature, so the Houyhnhnms had decided that Gulliver should either be employed like the rest of the Yahoos or sent back from whence he came. They fear that Gulliver's rudiments of reason will make him a dangerous leader who could raise the Yahoos in rebellion against the Houyhnhnms.
	Gulliver is grief-stricken at the prospect of leaving the Houyhnhnms and going back to England to live among Yahoos. He takes his leave of his Houyhnhnm master and sets sail in a boat he has constructed.
	Chapter XI
	At sea in his boat, Gulliver hopes to find an uninhabited island where he can live, rather than return to England. He finds what he believes is such an island, goes ashore, and sets up home. On the fourth day, he sees some natives, who fire an arrow at him and wound him in the knee. Gulliver escapes in his boat and goes ashore next to a creek on the same island. A ship draws near and sends some men ashore to get fresh water. They discover Gulliver and address him in Portuguese. Gulliver baffles them by describing himself as a Yahoo and by his manner of speech, which resembles the neighing of a horse. They tie Gulliver up and take him on board their ship. The captain, Don Pedro de Mendez, treats Gulliver with great courtesy.
	Gulliver tries to escape by leaping overboard rather than live among Yahoos, but is recaptured. Don Pedro gently explains that he only wants to help Gulliver. Gulliver tells the story of his life among the Houyhnhnms. Eventually, Don Pedro begins to believe him. Gulliver passes the journey trying to avoid contact with the crew because he has developed an aversion to humankind. He refuses Don Pedro's offer to lend him his best clothes, but Gulliver cannot bear to wear anything that has clothed a Yahoo. The ship arrives at Lisbon and Don Pedro accommodates Gulliver as his guest in his house. At first, Gulliver is too terrified of humans to venture outside. After some time, he agrees to go out in the company of Don Pedro, but insists on blocking his nose with herbs or tobacco to lessen the unpleasant smell of humankind.
	Don Pedro persuades a reluctant Gulliver to return England. He does so, but feels only disgust at his wife and family. For a year, he cannot tolerate their presence. He buys two horses and converses with them in their stable for four hours each day.
	Chapter XII
	Gulliver concludes his story by asserting the truth of his account and condemns those travel writers who lie and embellish. His motive, he says, is to serve the public good by drawing attention to the virtues of the Houyhnhnms and thereby to the vices of humankind. He adds that among the Yahoo nations, the least corrupted are the Brobdingnagians.
	Gulliver is pleased that his work can meet with no criticism or blame, for all he has done is relate the plain facts, without his own opinions.
	Gulliver has been advised that he must give an account of his discoveries to the Secretary of State, as any lands that are discovered by an English subject belong to the Crown (monarch). He has not done so, as it is not worth sending an army to conquer Lilliput, and it would not be safe or wise to invade Brobdingnag, Laputa, or the land of the Houyhnhnms. In addition, he does not wish to bring the violence and destruction of an invasion upon these nations. He quickly adds that he does not accuse the English of such behavior, as they are well known for their wisdom and justice in establishing colonies. But the nations he has visited do not wish to be conquered and enslaved, nor do they possess any valuable minerals or crops that the English government might be interested in, so he sees no point in making such a report.
	Recently, Gulliver has begun to allow his wife to sit at dinner with him, but he has to block his nose with herbs to disguise the smell. Perhaps one day, he may be able to tolerate the company of a fellow Yahoo. He finds himself particularly provoked by the combination of vices and pride in humankind. Houyhnhnms, though they are virtuous, utterly lack pride, and he hopes that any human who possesses this absurd vice will refrain from coming near him.
	Analysis
	The Houyhnhnm society is similar to that of the ancient Spartans, which, by the 5th century B.C., was the most powerful nation among all of Greece's city-states. Both societies had no written literature, but passed down laws and customs orally. Both societies emphasized morality and the importance of doing that which is right. Both societies regulated childbirth in the interests of society as a whole: the Spartans left weak or malformed babies to die to keep the race genetically strong, and the Houyhnhnms choose their mates with a similar aim. Both societies had the state educate children; both emphasized physical fitness, though with the Spartans, this last custom had a military purpose not shared with the Houyhnhnms.
	Though Gulliver describes the rational Houyhnhnm society with complete approval, it has attracted negative views from some modern critics and readers. In this society, the individual is subjugated to the interests of society as a whole. Houyhnhnms choose their mates for the good of the race, not out of personal preference, and feel no special emotions for their mates or children. Families with a surplus of children pass them, with complete equanimity, to another family that has a vacancy. They do not grieve for dead loved ones.
	This is a society, some critics point out, that is completely without the conflicts, hatreds, passions, strong preferences, and loves that define the texture of human society and that distinguish humans so markedly from one another. It is no coincidence, these critics add, that the Houyhnhnms are the only race visited by Gulliver who do not possess individual names. One Houyhnhnm is completely indistinguishable from another.
	No man can be entirely a Houyhnhnm (rational) or entirely a Yahoo (bestial). But he can be a Don Pedro. Don Pedro exemplifies such human virtues as kindness, charity, compassion, and generosity. Gulliver, who has been warped out of his humanness through excessive exposure to the Houyhnhnms, is blind to Don Pedro's goodness simply because the man does not look like a horse.
advertisement
The reader, who does not share Gulliver's fit of insanity, can appreciate it.
	There is irony in Gulliver's final condemnation of his fellow humans because of their pride. This is because Gulliver himself has become insufferably proud, feeling superior to everyone else because of his over-identification with the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver is not, and can never be, a Houyhnhnm, as is clear from their expulsion of him from their realm on the grounds that he is not one of them.

136,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - Awakening,"
	Siddhartha leaves the grove where the Buddha lives, feeling that he has left his former life behind. He no longer has a desire to listen to teachers. Deciding that in seeking for the Divine, he has lost himself, he resolves no longer to try to escape from himself. He will no longer despise the world and regard it as an illusion. He would find meaning in the world, not beyond it. He would start his life afresh. He has a few moments of loneliness, when he realizes how isolated he is, since he is now putting his old life behind him. He knows he cannot return to his father, the Brahmin priest. But he quickly regains confidence and walks forward briskly.
	Analysis
	In this short chapter Siddhartha undergoes an apparent reversal of his thinking. Up to this point, his goal has been to discover the ultimate reality of life that lies beyond the five senses. He had accepted the idea that the senses take a person away from the underlying truth. The reality, he believed, was an absolute, silent, universal consciousness that lay beyond the things of the world. The goal of the spiritual life was to access that silent, pure consciousness within oneself. Then one would realize that the Atman (the essence of the individual self) was the same as Brahman (the universal self). In this belief he is in accord with a long tradition of Indian religious thought. The world is seen as maya, or illusion, since it is just the play of temporary, impermanent forms, not the underlying reality that gives rise to those forms. But in this chapter, Siddhartha takes a new view. He decides that the divine can also be found in the world, because everything in creation is just the One expressing itself in multiple forms. There is no dichotomy between the absolute One and the multitude of relative forms the One takes on. In reaching this new understanding, Siddhartha has opened himself up to another aspect of traditional Indian thought. It is a paradox. The world is maya, it is not the divine (because it is impermanent), and yet it is also an expression of the divine. It is unity expressing itself through diversity. This sounds very abstract and it is. It is difficult to grasp at an intellectual level. It has to be directly experienced. This is indeed Siddhartha's complaint about the teachings he has so far encountered. They seem to him to lack that vital ingredient of direct experience. The experience of seeing the entire universe as an expression of one unified, divine consciousness manifesting through a multiplicity of forms will ultimately enlighten Siddhartha. But at the moment he is a long way from his goal. In fact, he is ready to forget it altogether.

137,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - Gotama,"Siddhartha and Govinda arrive in the town of Savathi. They spend the night nearby in the Jetavana grove, where the Buddha lives. In the morning they see the Buddha himself. He looks like the hundreds of other monks, but Siddhartha recognizes him by the complete peacefulness of his demeanor. In the evening, Siddhartha and Govinda listen to the Buddha preach about the way to gain release from suffering. Govinda is convinced by what he hears and joins the Buddha's community. Siddhartha gives him his blessing, but he has no intention of pursuing the same path. He tells his friend that he will be leaving him. In the morning Siddhartha speaks to the Buddha in person. Siddhartha acknowledges the wisdom and clarity of the Buddha's explanation of the chain of cause and effect in life, but he thinks he has found a flaw in the teaching. If it is possible to rise above the world and gain salvation, as the Buddha says, this means that the law of cause and effect has broken down. It is not a complete explanation of life. The Buddha replies that his goal is not to explain the world but to give salvation from suffering. Siddhartha then comments that in none of the Buddha's teachings does he explain the secret of what he experienced in his moment of enlightenment. Siddhartha says that he plans to leave all doctrines and teachers behind and reach his goal alone. The Buddha acknowledges that Siddhartha is clever, but warns him not to be too clever.
	Analysis
	The Buddha lived from about 563-483 B.C. in northern India. His given name was Gautama (or Gotama); the Buddha was a title given to him, meaning the enlightened or the awakened one. Unlike Siddhartha, the Buddha was not born into a Brahmin family. His father was from the warrior, or ksatriya, class. As a young man Gautama decided to renounce the world and seek a cure for human suffering. He became an ascetic and went in search of a teacher who could point him to the Truth, but none of the teachers he met satisfied him. After giving up his ascetic practices, he gained enlightenment while engaged in deep meditation. Traditionally, this moment happened near Gaya, in the modern state of Bihar, on the bank of the river Neranjara, a tributary of the sacred Ganges river. After this experience, the Buddha set out to teach others the path to salvation. When Govinda and Siddhartha hear him preach, the Buddha refers to the ""four main points"" and the ""Eightfold Path.""
	The first of these is often known as the Four Noble Truths. These truth are 1) life is suffering; 2) the origin of suffering lies in desire, or craving; 3) the cessation of suffering can be gained by the removal of desire; 4) the way to attain this is through the Eightfold Path. The Eightfold Path is a set of prescriptions about how life should be lived, involving right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, and the correct approach to meditation.

138,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - The Brahmin's Son,"Siddhartha is a young boy in India during the sixth century B.C., the time of the Buddha. He is the son of a Brahmin, a member of the priestly cast. Siddhartha is admired by all his family and friends, including Govinda, and he is expected to become a Brahmin priest. However, in spite of the fact that Siddhartha is much loved and has the gift of making others happy, he is not himself happy. On the contrary, he is restless and discontent. He senses that neither his father nor the other Brahmins who are in charge of his education really know the way to enlightenment, which Siddhartha believes to be the only knowledge worth having. The men have profound theoretical knowledge about enlightenment, but Siddhartha questions whether they really experience this exalted state. He thinks they are all still spiritual seekers, just as he is.
	One day Siddhartha sees three wandering ascetics, known as Samanas, as they pass through the town. They are thin and almost naked. Siddhartha tells Govinda that the following morning he will join the Samanas. Govinda is dismayed. Siddhartha respectfully asks his father for permission to leave the house and become a Samana. His father is not pleased, but eventually, when he sees how determined Siddhartha is, and realizes that his son has already left him in spirit, he gives his permission. As Siddhartha leaves town at daybreak, Govinda joins him.
	Analysis
	In India during the sixth century B.C., the religion was known as Vedism or Brahmanism. The Vedas are a collection of hymns to the gods dating from the period 1300 B.C. to 900 B.C. Veda literally means knowledge. The Vedic gods include Agni, the god of fire, and Indra, the warrior god. During the period from the eighth to the fifth century B.C., the philosophical texts known as the Upanishads were added to the canon of Vedic scriptures.
	Brahmins were the priestly caste who performed the Vedic sacrificial rituals. Siddhartha would have been expected to learn all these rituals and become a learned Brahmin, just like his father. Already as a boy he is aware of the central doctrine of the Upanishads. The Upanishads stated that the essence of each person's self, the Atman, was identical with the universal spirit, or Brahman. The goal of meditation was to realize the essential oneness of the individual and the universal soul. The word Om that Siddhartha mentions is a mantra, a word that is chanted or repeated silently in order to take the attention away from the outer world of the senses. When the mind is stilled in this way, the identity of Atman with Brahman becomes apparent; the individual consciousness is known to the same as the universal consciousness. In this chapter Siddhartha reveals that he has already been taught the technique of meditating using Om as a mantra. He has also been trained in the doctrine of the Upanishads: ""Already he knew how to recognize Atman within the depth of his being, indestructible, at one with the universe"" (p. 2). It is this experience that feeds Siddhartha's longing. He sees in the Brahmins only a vast parade of outer learning, but the inner core, the direct experience of enlightenment, is missing. Enlightenment dawns when the reality of the identity of Atman and Brahman, the individual and the universal, is experienced at every moment of every day.

139,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 1 - With the Samanas,"Part One
	With the Samanas
	Siddhartha and Govinda join the Samanas and learn their ascetic practices. Siddhartha fasts until he grows thin, and he develops a contempt for the things of the world. His aim is to conquer desire and experience the innermost core of being. He tries to overcome pain, hunger, thirst and fatigue by experiencing all of them to extreme degrees. He also practices stilling the breath through meditation. But he is dissatisfied with what he learns. He has not found out how to permanently lose his small, individual self. In a discussion with Govinda, he points out that the oldest Samana is about sixty, and he has still not attained the liberated condition known as Nirvana. Siddhartha doubts whether any of the Samanas will attain Nirvana. Govinda is shocked, and is even more distressed when Siddhartha says that he will soon be leaving the Samanas.
	After being with the Samanas for three years, Siddhartha and Govinda hear rumors about a man named Gotama, the Buddha. It was said that he had attained Nirvana and no longer experienced the sorrows of the world. Govinda is keen for them both to go and see the Buddha. Siddhartha, however, has learned to mistrust spiritual teachers, but Govinda persuades him to visit the Buddha. The leader of the Samanas is angry that the two young men want to leave him, but Siddhartha imposes his will on the old man, who then gives them his blessings.
	Analysis
	Ascetic practices can be found at some point in the history of almost every religion. They rest on the belief that there is a dichotomy between the body and the soul, the flesh and the spirit. If the body can be denied the fulfillment of its desires, then it will be conquered, and the individual will have attained a spiritual state. In such a condition, the passions and desires of the small, individual self will not interfere with the serenity of the innermost being, which is stillness, not passion. But Siddhartha finds that the techniques of asceticism do not work. The Samanas do not gain enlightenment, however hard they try. Once Siddhartha has decided to leave them, he never again practices such mortification of the body.
	The word Nirvana Siddhartha uses in this chapter to describe the condition of liberation is slightly anachronistic, since the term is usually associated with Buddhism, which Siddhartha has not yet encountered. Nirvana is a term that is difficult to translate or define accurately. It refers to the realization of the ultimate reality, but it should not be confused with the Christian concept of heaven.

140,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Amongst the People,"
	Siddhartha visits the merchant, Kamaswami. When Kamaswami discovers that Siddhartha can read and write, he invites him to stay as a guest in his house. Siddhartha lives in unaccustomed luxury, and Kamaswami explains his business to him. Soon Siddhartha starts to play a role in the business. He also continues to visit Kamala and learn from her about love. Siddhartha proves himself to be a valuable asset to Kamaswami's business, although he does not take it as seriously as the merchant does. It seems like a game to him and he does not worry about profits and losses. This is quite unlike Kamaswami, who worries and loses sleep whenever a transaction goes wrong. For Siddhartha, business is useful only because it brings him money to spend on Kamala. For the most part, he remains detached from the lives of other people, not sharing what he thinks is the pettiness of their concerns. His heart lies elsewhere. Talking with Kamala, he decides that they are similar. They are not like ordinary people. She says he is still a Samana at heart, because in his heart he loves no one. Siddhartha thinks that Kamala does not really love anyone either.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha flourishes in his new worldly occupations in part because of the legacy of his many years as a Samana and spiritual seeker. He does not get involved too seriously in the world's affairs. He remains essentially unattached, unlike the worldly merchant Kamaswami. When he begins this new life as merchant and lover, Siddhartha is like a freshly polished diamond. All his years of spiritual practice have given him a quiet strength and resilience that can easily withstand the stresses and strains of worldly life. It will take quite a while for the shine to be rubbed off that diamond. Siddhartha is rather ignorant in this respect; he has no idea of where the path he has chosen to follow will lead him. He will find out in the next chapter.

141,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - By the River,"Siddhartha wanders into the forest, knowing that he can never return to his former life. He is disgusted with his life and wants only oblivion. When he reaches the river, the same river he had been ferried across as a young man, he wants to throw himself into it and drown. Then he hears the holy word OM, which means ""perfection,"" welling up from within his soul, and for a moment he remembers the divine, and regrets that he had wished to die. He falls asleep and wakes up many hours later, feeling refreshed. It is as if he has been reborn. He sees a monk in a yellow gown sitting opposite him, and immediately recognizes him to be his old friend, Govinda. Govinda is still a disciple of the Buddha, and is on a pilgrimage. Govinda does not recognize Siddhartha until Siddhartha identifies himself. Siddhartha says that although he is not going anywhere in particular, he is on a pilgrimage, which surprises Govinda because Siddhartha is still dressed in his rich clothes. The two men part on friendly terms, although Govinda is mystified by what his friend tells him. After Govinda leaves, Siddhartha reflects on his life. He feels he has returned to how he was as a child, without possessions, and without knowledge. He accepts all his experiences that have led him to this point, and he is happy. He realizes that when he was a Brahmin and an ascetic, too much knowledge had hindered him, and he had been arrogant. He had had to go out and lose himself in worldly activities because that was the only way the arrogant Brahmin self could be destroyed. Then, out of his despair, a new man could arise.
	Analysis
	When he arrives at the river, Siddhartha's true awakening can begin. The river acts as a symbol of the totality of life, the unity and the diversity together, that Siddhartha must experience if he is to comprehend the ultimate nature of life. However, he is not yet aware of the full significance of the river. He only knows that he loves it and wants to stay near it. He has a great deal still to learn, but he is finally on the right track.
	Govinda returns to the story in this chapter to serve as a contrast to Siddhartha. Govinda is content to be a follower of the Buddha, to live within a set of teachings and doctrines he accepts. Siddhartha, on the other hand, must forge his own path.

142,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Govinda,"
	Govinda has heard talk of the wise old ferryman, and goes to see him. Siddhartha takes him across the river, but as happened the last time they met, Govinda does not recognize his old friend until Siddhartha reveals his identity. Govinda stays the night in Siddhartha's hut. Govinda asks Siddhartha whether he follows any teachings or doctrine. Siddhartha replies that wisdom, unlike knowledge, is not communicable. He explains that life should not be divided into the opposites of good and evil but accepted in its totality as an expression of perfection. Everything is good and necessary, death as well as life, sin as well as holiness, wisdom as well as folly. He sees infinite value in everything in creation, even a stone. He still distrusts teachings and words. He is no longer concerned, as Govinda still is, about whether the things in the world are real or illusory. The important thing, Siddhartha says, is that he should love them. Love is the most important thing in the world. Govinda replies that the Buddha did not preach love, because love would binds a person to earth rather than ensuring his salvation. Siddhartha admits there seems to be a contradiction between his own beliefs and the teachings of the Buddha, but he says the apparent contradiction is an illusion. He regards the Buddha as a great man who expressed great love for humanity. As Govinda prepares to leave, he thinks that Siddhartha is a strange man with strange thoughts. And yet he also acknowledges that Siddhartha radiates a purity and peace that he has encountered in no man other than the Buddha. He asks Siddhartha to give him something that will help him on his spiritual quest. Siddhartha asks him to kiss him on the forehead. As he does this, Govinda receives an experience of the unity of life in the midst of all its diversity. He sees all forms of life changing and being reborn, but he sees no death. He sees Siddhartha's smiling face as a smile of unity that somehow embraces all the changing forms. This smile of Siddhartha is exactly like the smile Govinda had perceived a hundred times in the smile of the Buddha. This is Govinda's moment of enlightenment. He bows low to Siddhartha, whose smile reminds him of everything he had ever loved in his life.
	Analysis
	In this final chapter, Siddhartha tries to give an explanation in words to Govinda of his experience of enlightenment that was described in the previous chapter. This explanation acts as both a reprise of Siddhartha's experience and a prelude to Govinda's, since Govinda's moment of awakening is essentially the same as Siddhartha's. The significance of repeating it through Govinda is that Siddhartha is now able not only to experience this exalted perception of life for himself but to pass it on to others.
	This chapter reinforces the recurring theme of the book, that merely following the doctrines of a teacher is not going to get a person enlightened. Govinda has spent all his life as a spiritual seeker, and although he is respected by the other monks, he has not found what he needs. Siddhartha has succeeded by going his own way, listening to his heart, and finally learning how to listen to and be aware of the totality of life. It is true that he was helped by Vasudeva, but the ferryman, with his few words and no doctrine, was a very different kind of spiritual teacher than Gotama the Buddha.
	The final emphasis is on the smile on the face of Siddhartha, which is indistinguishable from the smile of the Buddha. The Buddha is often depicted with a quiet, serene smile on his face. People read into this smile a variety of things: it is seen as a promise that salvation is possible, or as evidence that the ultimate reality of life, underlying the pain, is bliss, or simply as a smile of compassion. Hesse interprets it as the ""smile of unity over the flowing forms,"" which is in keeping with his view of enlightenment as the experience of unity amidst the infinite diversity of life.

	As he journeys along his way, Siddhartha appreciates the beauty of the world in a way he has never done before. He resolves to gain more experience by following the voice of his own heart. After a strange dream in which his friend Govinda appears but then turns into a woman, Siddhartha gets a ferryman to take him across the river. At midday he passes through a village. He greets a young woman, and she makes an amorous gesture, and he kisses her breast. But then an inner voice checks him, and he moves on, past the disappointed woman.
	He reaches a large town, where he sees a beautiful woman in a sedan chair carried by four people. He is enchanted by her beauty. On inquiry, he learns that the woman is Kamala, a well-known courtesan. Next morning, Siddhartha has his beard shaved off, his hair combed, and he bathes in the river. He sees Kamala again and speaks to her, asking her to be his teacher in matters of love, since he knows nothing of the art. She tells him that in order to be good enough for her, he must have fine clothes and shoes, and the money to buy her gifts. Siddhartha replies that he will come to her again when he has what he now lacks. Before he leaves he asks her advice about where he can get these things. He says that as a Samana all he can do is think, wait, and fast. But he can also compose poetry, and he recites a poem for her, and about her, on the spot. Kamala says his poetry is good and she kisses him, but tells him that he will not earn as much money as he needs from poetry. She orders her servant to give him a white gown. He leaves and returns the next day. She tells him that through others, she has spoken to Kamaswami, a rich merchant. He is expecting Siddhartha to call on him. If Siddhartha pleases him, the merchant will take him into his service. Siddhartha is confident that he will get whatever he wants because his years as a Samana have taught him how to focus single-mindedly on a goal.
	Analysis
	One aspect of the Buddhist Eightfold Path is celibacy. The fact that Siddhartha now decides to court Kamala is a clear rejection of this path. He is determined to experience to the full all that the world has to offer, although in following his own heart he convinces himself that that was exactly what the Buddha had done.

144,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - Om,"
	Now that he has felt the pain of losing his son, Siddhartha has more sympathy with the needs and desires of ordinary people. He again decides to seek his son in the town, but stops when he thinks he hears a special message from the river. He remembers when he rebelled against his own father, and realizes that his father must have suffered the same pain as he, Siddhartha, suffers now. Sorrows repeat themselves. Still suffering, he returns to the hut and tells Vasudeva of his troubles. Vasudeva, in his silent attentiveness, seems to Siddhartha like a god. They both go and sit by the river bank. Siddhartha practices his technique of listening to the river and realizes the unity of all life amidst all its diverse elements. He realizes that in the unity is perfection. His pain disappears as his Self merges with the unity. From that moment on, Siddhartha no longer fights against his destiny. He accepts everything. Vasudeva, now that he has seen his friend attain enlightenment, announces that he is leaving. He is going to live in the woods and be in the unity of all things.
	Analysis
	The painful experience of the loss of his son is important for Siddhartha because it helps him to develop compassion for others. The necessity of compassion is an important element in Buddhist thought.
	This chapter also reveals the exalted status of Vasudeva, the humble ferryman. He is himself an enlightened man (""his steps full of peace, his face glowing, his form full of light"") and he helps Siddhartha gain the same experience. In Buddhist thought, enlightenment is the knowledge that takes a person ""to the other shore,"" and this is the symbolic significance of what Vasudeva has been doing all his life-ferrying people from one side of the river to the other.
	The mystical experience that Siddhartha has in this chapter is the goal to which everything else in his life has been leading. The river yields up the final truth about life. Siddhartha apprehends all human experience, whether joy or sorrow, as part of a vast unity. Individuals, with their desires and longings, are like rivers flowing to the ocean; they all reach their goal and are reborn in some other form, just as water is ""reborn"" as vapor and rain. When Siddhartha hears (this is a metaphor for direct experience with all aspects of his being) all these individual songs of life singing in harmony as one great whole, he knows the perfection of life. He realizes that everything is as it should be; it cannot be improved upon, and he accepts his own place in it.
	This is Hesse's somewhat idiosyncratic version of what enlightenment is like-an expanded, cosmic perception of all opposites joined together in unity. It should not be automatically assumed that this is what the Buddha spoke of, or that the historical Buddha's experience of enlightenment was anything like this. There are, however, some similarities. According to Buddhist scriptural accounts of the Buddha's enlightenment, he was in these moments able to recollect all his former births, and to see with the ""heavenly eye"" over the entire world. The world appeared to him in perfect clarity, as if reflected in a spotless mirror. This is rather like the perfect clarity with which Siddhartha sees the world as he gazes into the river.
	Like most mystical experiences, Siddhartha's is hard to comprehend with the rational intellect. The mystic will say that this level of reality cannot be conveyed by words; it must be directly experienced for oneself.

	Samsara
	Years go by. Siddhartha becomes rich, with a house and servants of his own. The things of the world take possession of him, and he loses the spiritual longings of his youth. He becomes more like the ordinary people from whom he had once felt so detached. A weariness settles over him, which becomes more pronounced as each year goes by. He becomes acquisitive, and values possessions and riches in a way that he had never done before. They become a burden to him. He also becomes addicted to gambling with dice. He wins and loses large amounts of money. Eventually, when Siddhartha is in his forties, he becomes sick of his life. It seems empty and worthless to him. One day he sits under a mango tree in his garden and realizes that he must change his life. He can no longer go on living in the same way. That night he leaves town, never to return. Kamala is not surprised, because she always expected that one day he would leave. She also discovers that she is pregnant by him.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha cannot forever deny his spiritual nature. He was born to realize the Truth, but he allows his spiritual side to become overshadowed by worldly activities. He finds out for himself that what the world offers-riches, sex, all kinds of possessions-gradually obscures the truth. It obscures the reality of Brahman, the universal self, and Siddhartha eventually identifies only with the small individual self, the self that loves and hates, has joys and sorrows, gains and losses, all of which are keenly felt. Throughout all these years of ""success,"" Siddhartha's life was in fact shrinking, even though to outward observance it was expanding with riches and influence. It is not surprising that a man of Siddhartha's spiritual temperament should get fed up with it. He identifies the state he has fallen into as samsara, which is a Sanskrit word meaning confusion or ignorance.

146,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - The Ferryman,"Part Two
	The Ferryman
	Siddhartha decides to stay near the river, which he loves. His inner voice tells him he can learn from it. The river is always flowing on and yet it is always present; its is always different and yet always the same. Hungry, Siddhartha walks along the river bank to the ferry. The ferryman is the same man who conveyed him across the river many years ago. As they cross the river, Siddhartha says he has no money to pay the ferryman, but will offer his rich clothes instead. He hopes the ferryman can give him some old clothes to wear in exchange, and employ him as an apprentice. The ferryman, whose name is Vasudeva, agrees to take him in as a guest. That night Siddhartha tells Vasudeva the story of his life, and Vasudeva, whose wife died many years ago, invites Siddhartha to live with him. Siddhartha accepts.
	Days and months pass quickly. Siddhartha learns how to look after the boat, and he also learns from the river, as Vasudeva said he would. He learns that just as the river is always present everywhere, and has neither a past nor a future, so it is with life. There is no such thing as time. This discovery makes him very happy.
	As time goes by, Siddhartha begins to look as radiant and as happy as Vasudeva does. They both listen to the voice of the river. They begin to get a reputation among travelers for being holy men. One day, a group of monks come to be ferried across the river. They are going to see Gotama the Buddha, who is seriously ill and will shortly die. A stream of pilgrims come as the news spreads. They include Kamala, who has long since given up her life as a courtesan and taken refuge in the teachings of the Buddha. She has her young son with her. When they are not far from the ferry, a snake bites Kamala. She and her son run to the ferry, but Kamala collapses. They cry out for help. Vasudeva hears them and carries Kamala back to his hut. Siddhartha immediately recognizes her. They exchange kind words, and Siddhartha puts his son on his knee and recites a Brahmin prayer for him. Kamala is dying. She asks Siddhartha whether he has found peace, and as he smiles at her she realizes that he has. Kamala finds the same peace for herself as she gazes at Siddhartha in her last moments before death. That night, Siddhartha sits alone in front of the hut, listening to the river. In the morning, he and Vasudeva build Kamala's funeral pyre.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha, who has in the past scorned teachers, finds in Vasudeva a teacher who teaches no doctrines and uses few words. He simply listens to what Siddhartha has to say, and sometimes directs Siddhartha to listen to the river. It is through this practice of listening to the river and observing it that Siddhartha comes to the conclusion that time does not exist. Everything exists in a simultaneous present. Time is merely a construct that the intellect places on events in order to categorize and understand them. But it is not real. This profound realization serves only as a preliminary awakening, however. Siddhartha has realized this truth intellectually, but he has yet to know it as a matter of direct experience. This will only come in his moment of enlightenment.
	The death of Kamala reinforces that fact that Siddhartha's own involvement in the sensual world is over. Once he had played the role of a lover, but now, with the same woman, he plays a different role. The peace Kamala experiences as she gazes on Siddhartha's face in her last moments is utterly different from the physical ecstasy they had known together in the act of love. It shows how far Siddhartha has progressed on the spiritual path. He is able to communicate peace to others. This episode also foreshadows the experience Govinda will have in the final chapter.

147,Siddhartha: Novel Summary: Part 2 - The Son,"

	Siddhartha's eleven-year-old son finds it difficult to adjust to life with his father in a small hut. He has been used to riches and luxury. Siddhartha waits patiently, hoping to win the boy over, but young Siddhartha shows no sign of returning his father's love. Vasudeva advises him to take the boy to the town, find him a teacher and allow him to mix with boys and girls of his own age. Siddhartha is reluctant to part with his son, because he does not want him to repeat the mistakes of his father. Vasudeva tells he must let the boy work out his own destiny. But Siddhartha loves his son too much to let him go. Eventually the boy turns against his father, declaring his hatred and contempt for him. The next day he runs away. Against the advice of Vasudeva, Siddhartha goes looking for his son in the forest, and then in the town. He sees the pleasure garden where he first met Kamala, and for a long time he is lost in thoughts of his past. Then he realizes that he cannot help his son and must not force himself on the boy. He sits down, depressed. Some time later, Vasudeva comes to collect him, and the two men return in silence to their hut.
	Analysis
	Siddhartha has traveled a long way on the spiritual path, but he has not quite reached his goal. He is too deeply attached in a human way to his own son, and his love blinds him to what is best for the boy. He is trying to hold on to life and shape it the way he thinks it should be, instead of letting it go where it must go. It is as if he is putting his hands in the river and trying to prevent the water flowing on. The task is hopeless, but in this chapter only Vasudeva realizes this.

Part I Chapters I-III

	 
Summary
	Chapter I
	Gulliver summarizes the story of his life before the main plot begins with his arrival in the country of Lilliput. He is the third of five sons of the owner of an estate in Nottinghamshire, England. He is educated at Cambridge University and serves an apprenticeship with a surgeon. After marrying a woman called Mary Burton, he takes up a post as surgeon aboard a ship traveling to the South Seas. On the way to the East Indies, the ship is blown onto rocks and wrecked. Gulliver manages to swim to land and falls asleep from exhaustion. When he awakes, he finds that he is tied to the ground and surrounded by tiny human beings of six inches high. He tries to escape his bonds, but they fire arrows at him, causing him pain. One makes a speech in a language he does not understand. He signals that he is hungry, and the little people feed him with baskets of food. He is tempted to crush them, but resists because he fears that they could harm him and because he feels that he has made them a promise of honor by his submissive behavior.
	An emissary from the Emperor climbs onto Gulliver's body and makes clear that he is to be conveyed to the capital city. There, they give him a disused temple to live in and tether him to it with a chain.
	Chapter II
	Gulliver describes in detail the difficult process of defecation, with the aim of defending himself against accusations of uncleanliness. The first time, he relieves himself inside his house, but thereafter he does so outside the house, and his excrement is taken away by servants.
	The Emperor arrives and makes a speech. Afterwards, some people in the crowd shoot arrows at Gulliver. The colonel delivers them to Gulliver for punishment, but he sets them free. The Lilliputians are impressed by this show of mercy.
	The Emperor holds a council to debate what to do with Gulliver. His advisors are concerned that he will cause a famine because he eats so much, and that if they kill him, his carcass might cause a plague. The debate is interrupted by the arrival of army officers, who report Gulliver's mercy to his attackers. The Emperor and his advisors are so pleased that they arrange for him to be fed, clothed, and taught their language.
	Gulliver receives many visits from the Emperor and repeatedly asks for his freedom. The Emperor refuses, saying that Gulliver must first swear to honor a peace treaty.
	Chapter III
	Gulliver describes two diversions which are practiced by people seeking positions and honors at court. The first is rope-dancing, whereby candidates for office at court dance on a rope. Whoever jumps highest without falling is given the job. Sometimes, existing ministers are expected to show that they still possess this skill. The rivalry is such that often there are fatal accidents, as ministers strain too far and fall. In the second activity, candidates for honors at court must leap over, and creep under, a stick held out by the Emperor. Whoever shows most agility at ""leaping and creeping"" is awarded a piece of colored silk.
	The people begin to trust Gulliver, and he arranges for the Emperor to organize military exercises on his handkerchief.
	At last, the Emperor allows the subject of Gulliver's freedom to be debated in his council. The only one to oppose it is Skyresh Bolgolam, the Admiral, who has made himself Gulliver's enemy. Bolgolam is overruled, but he draws up a list of conditions to which Gulliver must agree. These include not leaving the country without the Emperor's permission, not trampling on the people, and helping the Lilliputians fight their enemies from the Island of Belfescu, who are about the invade. In return, the Lilliputians promise to feed him. Gulliver agrees and is released from his chains.
	Analysis
	Swift goes to some lengths to portray his protagonist, Gulliver, and his travels with an air of realism. Gulliver's background is described in credible detail, and his journey to Lilliput is presented in the style of a travelogue, including references to actual places such as the West Indies. When he reaches Lilliput, details about the country and its people are given which are aimed at painting a believable picture of real human beings in a real society. This serves Swift's satirical purpose, as the implication is that the Lilliputians are sufficiently like the reader for the reader to apply what is said about them to his or her own society.
	The only far-fetched aspect of Lilliput is the minuscule size of the people, but this too makes an important satirical point. Though the average Lilliputian adult is about six inches tall, the Lilliputians think of themselves as important and impressive, and of their affairs as highly significant. Gulliver reports of the Emperor, ""He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders"" (Chapter II). In Skyresh Bolgolam's document listing the conditions of Gulliver's freedom, the Emperor is addressed by his long name and is called the ""delight and terror of the universe . . . whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes against the sun ."" (Chapter III). This is ludicrous exaggeration for the purpose of flattery, as the Emperor is tiny in comparison to Gulliver. The effect of Swift's satire is to puncture the pomposity of human beings - those of Gulliver's size as much as that of the Lilliputians. After all, who is to say that there is not some Gulliver who dwarfs human society on Earth? Size is relative, and, Swift suggests that in the greater scheme of things, the human race may be less awe-inspiring than it believes.
	The Lilliputians' smallness also draws attention to their moral limitations. They (particularly their leaders) are morally diminished people in comparison to Gulliver, who is a fairly honest and well-meaning man.
	Swift satirizes the system of appointments and honors in contemporary European courts in his description of the Lilliputian diversions of rope-dancing and ""leaping and creeping"" (Chapter III). Positions at court are given to those who can dance highest on the rope without falling. Similarly, honors (the pieces of colored silk awarded to Lilliputian favorites accurately describe some of the real honors given by real monarchs) are given to those who leap over, and creep under, a stick held by the Emperor with most agility. In both cases, Swift means that people at court are promoted not because of worth but because they please the monarch in some way, perhaps with elaborate flattery.
	European society's obsession with time is satirized in the Lilliputians' assumption that Gulliver's watch is a god that he worships, since ""he seldom did any thing without consulting it"" (Chapter II).
	Many critics have noted Swift's preoccupation with bodily functions (called scatology). This section of Gulliver's Travels is an example. Gulliver's habits of defecation and urination are detailed, along with an episode in which the Emperor has Gulliver stand with his legs apart and marches his army march underneath them, whereupon they cannot resist looking up. It is probable that such material reflects Swift's own preoccupations, but it also serves his satirical purpose. The eighteenth century, when Swift wrote Gulliver's Travels, was called ""the Age of Enlightenment"" when writers and thinkers emphasized the power of man's reason to lift him above the lower kingdom of animals. Reason was thought to be the basis of ethics, aesthetics, and proper government, as well as the way in which man could obtain knowledge of the truth. Some commentators believed it to be a divine faculty that brought man close to God. In Gulliver's Travels, Swift celebrates reason in the form of the Houyhnhynms, who appear in Part IV (though significantly, he makes his reason-based characters horses, not people).
advertisement
But he was also convinced that man is an animal, complete with base appetites. His emphasis on bodily functions is a way of never letting his reader forget this.
	It is noteworthy that Gulliver seldom gives his own views of what he sees and hears on his travels. He is drawn as an objective and, indeed, naive, observer. This is another tactic that reinforces Swift's satirical purpose, as any satirical conclusions drawn belong to the reader, while Swift and his protagonist hide behind a veneer of innocence and impartiality.

150,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part I Chapters IV-VI,"Summary
Chapter IV
	Gulliver obtains the Emperor's permission to visit Mildendo, the capital city of Lilliput, where he visits the royal palace.
One morning, Reldresal, the Secretary of Private Affairs, visits Gulliver. He tells him that there are two sources of conflict in Lilliput, internal and external. The internal dissent is due to the two political parties in Lilliput which constantly fight each other. They are called Tramecksan and Slamecksan, and are distinguished from one another by the high or low heels worn by their adherents. The Emperor is a low heel and has decided to employ mostly low heels at court, but the heir to the throne is thought to incline more towards the high heels.
The external threat to Lilliput is that of invasion from the Island of Blefescu. Lilliput has long been at war with Blefescu as a result of disagreement over the correct way to break an egg: at the smaller end or the big end. Originally, Lilliput was a Big-Endian nation, but the present Emperor's grandfather once cut his finger while breaking his egg at the big end, and passed a decree ordering all his subjects to break their eggs at the smaller end. Since then, there have been rebellions around this issue in Lilliput, and these have been fomented by Blefescu, still a Big-Endian nation. Now, Blefescu is about to send its fleet to invade Lilliput, and the Emperor, who is convinced of Gulliver's valor and strength, wishes him to understand the situation. Gulliver sends a message back saying that although as a foreigner, it is not fitting for him to interfere in political parties, he is ready to risk his life in defense of the Emperor and his country.
Chapter V
	Gulliver wades and swims to Blefescu, armed with a cable and iron bars. He finds the enemy fleet. The Blefescudians are so afraid when they see him that they leap out of their ships and swim to shore. Enemy soldiers fire arrows at Gulliver, but he puts on his spectacles to protect his eyes and, using the cable and iron bars, ties the ships together and drags them back to Lilliput. The Lilliputians greet him as a hero and the Emperor confers upon him the highest title of honor. The Emperor, emboldened by this victory, wants to invade Blefescu and govern it as his province, forcing the people to break the smaller end of their eggs. Gulliver refuses to support this notion, which he believes to be the equivalent of enslaving the Blefescudians. The Emperor cannot forgive Gulliver, and he and a group of ministers begin plotting against him.
Ambassadors from Blefescu arrive and offer a peace agreement, which the Emperor agrees with conditions favorable to himself. Gulliver uses his influence at court to help the Blefescudians with regard to the treaty, and they invite him to visit their country. Gulliver asks the Emperor's permission to go, and he agrees, but coldly. Gulliver learns that Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer, and Bolgolam have represented to the Emperor Gulliver's dealings with the Blefescudian ambassadors as disloyalty. For the first time, Gulliver thinks that courts and ministers may not be perfect.
One night, Gulliver is awakened by people milling around his door. Courtiers arrive and beg Gulliver to come immediately to the palace, where the Empress's apartment is on fire. Gulliver puts the fire out by urinating on the palace. It is an offense punishable by death for anyone to urinate in the palace grounds. The Emperor promises Gulliver a pardon, which, however, does not arrive. Gulliver hears that the Empress is so offended by his action that she has moved into another part of the palace, ordering that the apartments on which Gulliver urinated must never be repaired.
Chapter VI
	Gulliver describes Lilliput. Everything, including trees and livestock, is tiny, in proportion with the people. He goes on to describe some of the customs of the Lilliputians. Some he views as absurd, such as their practice of burying their dead with their heads downward, because they believe that by the time of the resurrection, the earth will have turned upside down, and thus the dead will be standing on their feet. Other customs seem more valuable, such as their harsh treatment of those informers who falsely denounce an innocent man. If the accused makes his innocence clear in court, the informer is put to death and his estate is used to compensate the innocent person. Fraud is considered to be worse than theft, as honest people have no defense against deceit.
Lilliputians believe that justice should be used not only to punish the guilty but to reward the law-abiding, who are given money and titles of honor. In employing people, they think that good morals are more important than extraordinary ability, since mistakes committed by a virtuous person would never be as serious as fraud committed by a corrupt person.
Atheists are banned from holding public office, since the head of state, the Emperor, draws his authority from God and anyone who disowns that authority cannot make a good servant to the state.
Gullliver adds he is describing the original institutions rather than the current reality, which has degenerated into such corruptions as leaping and creeping.
The education of children is not entrusted to parents, who, it is believed, produce children only as a result of lust. Children of both sexes, except those of laborers, are taken from their parents at an early age and brought up in public nurseries. They are taught virtues such as honor and justice, and are always kept busy. Parents are allowed to visit them only twice a year. Which school a child attends depends on the social status of his or her parents. Children from upper-class families attend different nurseries from those for the children of gentlemen and tradesmen. Upper-class boys continue in education until they are fifteen. Girls from upper-class families have almost the same education as their male counterparts. When the girls are twelve years of age, they are considered ready for marriage and their parents take them home. Boys from trading families are put out to apprenticeships at eleven years old, and girls from such families are apprenticed at nine. Each family pays for its own children's education, as it is not considered fair to give way to one's appetites and conceive children and then expect the burden of looking after them to fall upon the state. However, the fee is graded according to what the family can afford. Laborers keep their children at home, as their business is to cultivate the earth. Old and sick people are looked after in hospitals, and beggars are unknown.
Flimnap has been complaining to the Emperor that Gulliver is costing the Treasury vast sums of money for his keep, and that he should be sent away. Gulliver believes that Flimnap was acting out of jealousy over his wife, who was rumored to have visited Gulliver at his house in secret. Gulliver insists that that her visits were always public and that she always came in company. Though Flimnap and his wife made up their disagreement, he never forgave Gulliver and influenced the Emperor against him.
Analysis
	In this section, Swift satirizes what he sees as the petty differences and disagreements between political parties and religions. The Tramecksan or high heels represent the Tories, and the Slamecksan or low heels represent the Whigs, the two political parties in eighteenth-century England.
Lilliput represents England and Blefescu is France; the Big-Endians are Catholics and the Small-Endians are Protestants. England, in common with the rest of Europe, was originally a Catholic country, viewing the Pope as the spiritual authority. But in the 1520s and 1530s, King Henry VIII of England wanted to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, with whom he had been unable to produce an heir, and to marry Anne Boleyn. This episode is referred to in Gulliver's Travels as the Emperor's grandfather cutting his finger while trying to break an egg at the big end. The Pope refused to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine, and in the 1530s Henry broke with Rome and made himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The English Church became progressively more Protestant until Henry's successor, Edward VI, made England officially a Protestant nation. However, conflict between Catholic and Protestant factions in England, and between Protestant England and Catholic France, persisted for centuries.
In reducing the differences between Tories and Whigs, Catholics and Protestants, and England and France, to the trivial level of heel height and manner of breaking eggs, Swift portrays the defining conflicts of English and European history as petty and meaningless. Just as it does not matter how anyone breaks an egg, Swift is suggesting that differences in the ways in which people worship God do not matter, and are not a cause for war.
The episode in Chapter V in which Gulliver urinates on the Empress's apartment to put out a fire, only to be repudiated by her, may be a satirical reference to an incident in his own life. Many critics believe that the urination refers to Swift's publication in 1704 of his satirical work A Tale of a Tub, and that the Empress's disgust at his action refers to Queen Anne of England's disapproval of the work and her subsequent attempt to restrict his career prospects in the Church of England. Swift claimed, both in ""The Apology for the &c."" which is one of his prefaces to A Tale of a Tub, and symbolically in this chapter of Gulliver's Travels, that he wrote the work in order to protect the monarchy against the factions that threatened it.
Chapter VI presents many Lilliputian practices that are presented without the satirical tone of the rest of Part I. Gulliver, and Swift, appear to believe that these are sensible ideas that should be adopted in real society. Many modern readers will agree that it seems fair to treat fraud as a more serious crime than theft, to which many people were driven in Swift's time by poverty, and to educate girls in much the same way as boys (a revolutionary idea in Swift's time). Other ideas are more contentious, such as taking children away from parents and having them brought up in public nurseries. Swift appears to have believed that the only reason that people have children is as an unwanted side-effect of gratifying their sexual appetites. Based on this assumption, he mistrusted parents and did not believe that they were capable of bringing up children well.

Summary
	Chapter VII
	A court official visits Gulliver in secret and warns him that Bolgolam's hostility towards him has increased since Gulliver's success against Blefescu. Bolgolam, Flimnap and several others have conspired to charge Gulliver with crimes punishable by the death penalty. He shows Gulliver a copy of the charges against him. These include charges of high treason for urinating in the palace grounds; acting traitorously by refusing to seize all the Blefescudian ships, reduce that country to a province of the Emperor, and put to death all people who refused to forsake the Big-Endian heresy; and acting traitorously by being friendly to the Blefescudian ambassadors and planning to visit their country even though it has recently been an enemy of Lilliput.
	The official tells Gulliver the story of the debate at court about him. The Emperor is inclined to show mercy on account of the services Gulliver had done him, but Bolgolam and Flimnap insist that Gulliver be put to a painful death by setting fire to his house at night. Reldresal, who claims to be Gulliver's friend, counsels the Emperor to combine mercy with justice by merely putting out his eyes. Bolgolam and the rest of the council disapprove of this suggestion, as the life of a traitor should not be preserved. Bolgolam says that Gulliver may well flood the palace by urinating on it again. He suspects that Gulliver is a secret Big-Endian, and wants him put to death. Flimnap agrees, pointing out the expense of keeping Gulliver.
	The Emperor is against the death penalty for Gulliver. Reldresal suggests that the problem of the expense of keeping Gulliver can be solved by slowly reducing hs diet and starving him to death. They could then cut the flesh from the body and bury it to prevent plagues, leaving the skeleton as a monument to posterity.
	It is decided that the official sentence against Gulliver will be putting out his eyes, and the plan to starve him to death will be secretly implemented. The courtiers expect Gulliver to be grateful for such a lenient sentence, which they intend to carry out by having Gulliver lie on the ground and firing arrows into his eyes. As is the custom after the court decrees any cruel and unjustified execution, the Emperor makes a speech praising his own merciful nature, which is published throughout the kingdom. The people are terrified, as they have noticed that the more lavish these praises, the more inhuman is the punishment, and the more innocent the victim. Gulliver admits that he is a poor judge of such things, but his sentence appears to him rather rigorous. He briefly considers destroying the city, but remembers his oath to the Emperor, and decides he cannot.
	Gulliver decides to escape to Blefescu. He sends a message to Reldresal saying that he has gone to Blefescu in line with his promise and the leave granted him by the Emperor. He takes a warship to carry his belongings and, dragging it behind him, wades and swims to the island. He is received with great honor by the Emperor of Blefescu and the courtiers. Gulliver does not mention his disgrace, feeling justified in this omission by the fact that he has no official knowledge of it.
	Chapter VIII
	Three days after his arrival in Blefescu, Gulliver finds an upturned boat floating in the sea and drags it into the harbor. He explains to the Emperor of Blefescu that fortune has provided the boat to enable him to travel to some place from which he might return to his native land, and asks for permission to leave, which the Emperor grants.
	Gulliver learns later that the Emperor of Lilliput at first is unconcerned over his absence, as he believes that Gulliver has only gone to Blefescu for a short visit in line with his promise. But when time passes and Gulliver does not return, he sends an envoy to Blefescu with a warrant for Gulliver's arrest, conveying to the Emperor of Blefescu that he must tie him up and deport him back to Lilliput, on pain of risking the peace treaty between the nations. The Emperor of Blefescu returns the answer to the Emperor of Lilliput that he cannot do as requested because he owes Gulliver many obligations due to his good service in making the peace. He adds that Gulliver will soon depart, and that both empires will be free from him.
	The Emperor of Blefescu offers Gulliver his protection if he would continue in his service. But Gulliver no longer trusts monarchs or ministers, and politely refuses. The Emperor of Blefescu helps Gulliver fit out his boat and gives him livestock to live off on his journey. Gulliver sets sail and soon encounters an English ship. He recognizes an old friend, Peter Williams, among the crew. When Gulliver tells him something about where he has been, Williams does not believe him, until he shows the miniature cows and sheep that he has been carrying in his pocket.
	Back in England, Gulliver stays just two months with his wife and family before setting off on another sea voyage, the story of which he will tell in the second part of his Travels.
	Analysis
	The satirical focus of this section is the unreliability of the favor of monarchs and their ministers, and their brutality to those whom they deem to be enemies. Though Gulliver has saved the Empress's life, and possibly the entire royal palace and family, by urinating on the fire, she shows no gratitude. Instead, she conspires with Flimnap to have Gulliver sentenced to death for treason. The Emperor and various other courtiers join the conspiracy against him, including Reldresal, who always purported to be Gulliver's friend. Some of Swift's bitterest satire is reserved for this section, in which Reldresal and the Emperor claim to be merciful by suggesting punishments other than death, such as putting out Gulliver's eyes and slowly starving him to death. They even expect Gulliver to be grateful for their leniency. The impression given is that the favor or disfavor of monarchs and governments is arbitrarily earned and lost, without respect to justice or truth. The Emperor (and, by satirical implication, many real-life monarchs) adds to his moral crimes that of hypocrisy: when the court has decreed a particularly unjust execution, he gives speeches praising his own mercy and distributes copies throughout the kingdom. Gulliver the narrator comments, ""nor did any thing terrify the people so much as those encomiums on his Majesty's mercy; because it was observed, that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent"" (Chapter VII). The episode reveals the Emperor, and rulers like him, to be a brutal tyrant masquerading as a compassionate leader.
advertisement
The fact that even the naive Gulliver eventually realizes that rulers and their governments are not to be trusted, conveyed as it is in extremely understated terms (""although I believed him [the Emperor of Blefescu] sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where I could possibly avoid it"" - Chapter VIII), makes the satirical attack stronger. This is because the reader sees the monarch's or minister's betrayal coming before Gulliver catches on, and when it arrives, the reader feels more outrage than the placid Gulliver, as if on his behalf. The righteous anger is therefore taken on by the reader as his or her own, giving it more emotional impact.

152,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part II Chapters I-III,"Summary
Chapter I
	Driven by restlessness, Gulliver sets out on another sea voyage. They land in an unknown country to replenish their store of fresh water. Gulliver walks off alone in search of water, and sees that the rest of the crew are rowing for their lives back to the ship, and huge creature is walking after them. Gulliver runs in the opposite direction. He finds that everything - the hedges, corn, and stiles - is huge. Then he notices some gigantic men carrying reaping hooks. They are about the height of an English church steeple. Gulliver reaches a part of the field where the corn has been laid flat by wind and rain, and finds he cannot make his way through it. He hears the reapers approaching, and fears that he will be killed. He reflects that he is as powerless in this land as he was powerful in Lilliput, simply because of his relative size.
Just as one of the reapers is about to crush him, Gulliver alerts him to his presence by screaming. The man picks him up and takes him to his master, a farmer. The farmer shows Gulliver to his wife, who screams. Gradually, however, she grows very fond of him. They give Gulliver dinner. The farmer's son picks him up by the legs and holds him high in the air, but his father snatches Gulliver from his grasp. The baby of the family treats Gulliver as a plaything and puts him in his mouth before letting him drop, and he is only saved from a broken neck by the farmer's wife. The baby's wet-nurse has to quiet the baby by suckling him. Gulliver describes with disgust the huge size of the nurse's breast.
After dinner, Gulliver is put to bed by the farmer's wife. He needs to relieve himself, but when he gets out of the bed, he is attacked by two rats, and kills one. When the farmer's wife returns, he manages to make her aware of his need to relieve himself, and she takes him out to the garden to do so.
Chapter II
	Gulliver is befriended by the farmer's daughter, whom he calls Glumdalclitch, or ""little nurse."" She names him Grildrig. Gulliver explains that he owes his survival in Brobdingnag to her, but fears that he was the instrument of her disgrace. News soon spreads that the farmer has found a strange creature in his field. One of the farmer's friends comes to see Gulliver and advises the farmer to make some money by exhibiting him on a market day. Glumdalclitch is deeply ashamed of her father's plan, though Gulliver is more philosophical, since even the King of Great Britain, in his situation, would undergo the same treatment.
The farmer puts Gulliver in a box and carries him to the market, where people pay to see him perform. A boy throws a hazelnut at him, and it is so big that it narrowly misses killing him. Gulliver has to entertain spectators for eight hours, and as the farmer continues to exhibit him at his home, he becomes exhausted. Finding that he can make a large profit out of Gulliver, the farmer decides to exhibit Gulliver all over the country, and sets off on a tour with him. Glumdalclitch accompanies them and does her best to keep Gulliver comfortable.
Chapter III
	The more money the farmer makes out of Gulliver, the greedier he gets and the harder he pushes him, until Gulliver is reduced to little more than a skeleton. The farmer calculates that Gulliver will die soon and is the more determined to make as much profit as possible before that happens.
One day, a courtier arrives and orders the farmer to take Gulliver to court for the amusement of the Queen. The Queen takes a liking to Gulliver and buys him from the farmer for a thousand gold pieces. Gulliver requests that Glumdalclitch might be admitted into the Queen's service, and that she can continue to look after him. The Queen agrees. The King invites three scholars to work out exactly what kind of creature Gulliver is. After much debate, they can only conclude that he is a ""lusus naturae,"" or joke of nature. When Gulliver explains to the scholars that he come from a land where there are many others like him, and where everything is in proportion, they smile contemptuously and do not believe him. The King, however, is more intelligent than the scholars, and after questioning the farmer, is inclined to believe Gulliver. The Queen has a house and clothes made for him, and becomes so attached to him that she cannot dine without him.
The King questions Gulliver about the religion, politics, and laws of Europe, and Gulliver explains as well as he can, including giving an account of the schisms in religion and the state. The King laughs and reflects on the ridiculousness of human vanity and pride, which is so potent a force even among people of Gulliver's size, who are to Brobdingnagians as small and as insignificant as insects. Gulliver admits that after spending some time amid people of such great size, he himself would be amused to see a group of English lords and ladies, strutting about in their finery. He even thinks that he himself looks ridiculous when place next to the Queen, so small is he.
The Queen's dwarf takes a malicious delight in finding someone smaller than himself to bully, and drops Gulliver in a bowl of cream. He is saved by Glumdalclitch.
Gulliver is much bothered by flies, which leave behind piles of excrement that are obvious to him, though the Brobdingnagians cannot see them.
Analysis
	""I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian would be among us."" (Part II, Chapter I)
Relative size and significance is a major satirical theme of Gulliver's Travels. Size confers power, so while Gulliver is powerful in Lilliput, he is utterly powerless in Brobdingnag. Without the benefit of such a comparison, however, it is easy for a race or nation to delude itself about how much power and significance it has. The Lilliputians are in the habit of thinking of themselves as very important, though Gulliver could easily crush them. Swift's satirical point is that however important or powerful any group of human beings believes itself to be - including his own contemporaries - they are insignificant in the greater scheme of things, as the arrival of any person or force stronger than them will show. Power is shown to be relative and contingent upon circumstances. This theme is a well-aimed cautionary message to Swift's English contemporaries. England had joined with Scotland in 1707 to form the new state of Great Britain. The new kingdom was the major power in Europe, due to its success in trade, its military capability, and the size of its fleet. It treated the rest of the world with an arrogance corresponding to its strength. That Swift's sympathies lay not with the great power but with the victims of power is clear throughout Gulliver's Travels.
In Chapter III, Swift warns of the insubstantial and relative nature of power through his mouthpiece, the King of Brobdingnag. After Gulliver explains to him about the schisms in European religion and politics, ""he observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as I."" The conservative Gulliver is predictably embarrassed to hear ""our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honour, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated,"" but the reader cannot miss Swift's point, which is to puncture the vanity and pride of the puffed-up, arrogant English and Europeans.
Brobdingnag gives Gulliver ample range to convey his disgust at the functions and appearance of the human body when seen in magnified scale. In Chapter I, Gulliver is repulsed by the sight of the vast breast of the wet-nurse who looks after the baby. The sight makes Gulliver reflect that female bodies only appear beautiful because people cannot see them in such detail. The effect of such observations is to banish human vanity. They also make the point that anything, when examined in close enough detail, reveals imperfections that may not be visible to man's imperfect senses. Swift lived in an age that was making rapid advances in microscopy, and books were being published with illustrations of insects, organisms, and other substances that had never been seen in such detail before.
Despite Gulliver's disgust at the magnified human functions of the Brobdingnagians, their large size reflects their moral stature, which is greater than Gulliver's. Gulliver lies to the king of Brobdingnag out of pride, in order to make England seem better than it is; he is a hypocrite. Most Brobdingnagians are honest people, and this honesty is enshrined in their leadership and government. This is in contrast with England, where the worst vices of the people are built into the government. The Brobdingnagians' morality is also seen in the fact that they do not use their size to exploit and destroy smaller and weaker people. An exception is the farmer, who is prepared to let Gulliver die to make him more profit. This episode is one of Swift's frequent pleas for compassion for the underdog. As a native of Ireland, which for centuries was under the domination of England and later Great Britian, Swift was acutely conscious of the tendency of powerful peoples to oppress the less powerful. Clearly, there can be no more effective way to teach the powerful compassion and humility than for them to spend some time as the underdog, as Gulliver does in Brobdingnag.
Swift targets the pretensions of supposedly learned scholars in the characters of the three scholars who debate as to what sort of creature he could be. They are determined not to believe the most convenient source of information about him, which is Gulliver himself.
The best idea that they can come up with is that he is one of nature's jokes. On one level, this reveals Swift's conviction of the stupidity of some highly educated people. But on another level, Swift is suggesting that the whole of humanity is one of nature's jokes. Gulliver and people of his size may be tempted to view the relatively tiny Lilliputians as nature's jokes, but then in Brobdingnag, it is Gulliver and his race who are the joke. Somewhere else again, it is possible that the huge Brobdingnagians may meet a race of beings who dwarf them, who treat them as insignificant little insects, and who conclude that they are nature's jokes.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Gulliver describes the physical characteristics of the country of Brobdingnag.
	Glumdalclitch takes Gulliver with her on trips to town. He sees beggars with serious and visible diseases such as breast cancer, the magnified sight of which horrifies him.
	Chapter V
	The dwarf continues to bully Gulliver, shaking apples from a tree onto him.
	The Queen's Maids of Honor often invite Glumdalclitch and Gulliver to their apartments, where they strip Gulliver naked and lay him against their breasts. Gulliver is disgusted at the smell emanating from their bodies, which is overwhelming. He recalls that in Lilliput, after taking exercise, a Lilliputian had complained that he smelt strongly.
	Gulliver is taken to see a public execution, which is a horrific sight, as the arteries spurt blood forty feet into the air.
	The Queen has a tiny boat made for Gulliver, and she and her ladies entertain themselves with watching him sail it in a trough.
	One day, a monkey seizes Gulliver and carries him up onto a roof. Some men pursue the monkey, who drops Gulliver. The King discusses the episode with Gulliver, who says that if he had thought to make use of his sword, he would have wounded the monkey and frightened him away. The King only laughs at him, and everyone else joins in. Gulliver reflects that it is hopeless to try to preserve one's honor when in the company of those who are not his equals. And yet, he thinks, he has often seen contemptible people in England presume that they are important.
	Glumdalclitch takes Gulliver for a walk in the country, and he falls in a pile of cow dung. Though Glumdalclitch loves Gulliver, she makes the most of any story that she thinks might amuse the Queen, and the story is passed around the court, to the amusement of everyone.
	Chapter VI
	Gulliver uses some combings of the Queen's hair to make a pair of miniature chairs as a present for her.
	The King, whom Gulliver describes as ""a prince of excellent understanding,"" asks him to describe the government of England in detail, hoping that he might learn of something that can benefit his own country. Gulliver tells him about the two chambers of Parliament, the House of Lords and House of Commons, and about the Courts of Justice. The King asks penetrating questions about these institutions, such as how the nobility who are destined for the House of Lords are educated, and whether new lords are sometimes chosen for dishonorable reasons, such as favoritism, bribes, or for the purpose of strengthening a party opposite to the public interest. He asks whether the lords are so free from avarice that bribes cannot influence them, and whether the bishops chosen to sit in the House of Lords are promoted on account of the holiness of their lives, or because they servilely follow the opinions of some nobleman who employed them before their elevation to the Lords.
	The King asks about how members of the House of Commons are elected. He wants to know whether votes can be bought; he asks why people want so much to be members of the Commons when they receive no salary, and wonders if it is because they are ready to sacrifice the public good in return for illicit rewards from a corrupt monarch and ministers.
	The King asks about the Courts of Justice. He asks whether lawyers are allowed to plead in causes known to be unjust or oppressive; whether lawyers and judges are well educated in justice or merely in local or national customs; and whether lawyers or judges have any part in writing the laws which they later interpret (thereby opening up a potential conflict of interest).
	Next, the King turns his attention to England's management of its treasury. He cannot understand how a government can be so imprudent as to spend more than its income, and why it should engage in such costly and frequent wars. He believes that the English must be unusually quarrelsome, or that they must have unusually bad neighbors. He cannot grasp what business England has sending a military presence to other countries, unless it be to protect trade or to honor a treaty. Regarding England's warring factions in religion and politics, he believes that people should be allowed to hold opinions contrary to the public good in religion and politics, as long as they do not try to spread them.
	The King inquires into the nobility's habit of gambling. He is concerned about its negative effects on their minds and finances.
	Responding to Gulliver's account of the history of England, the King is horrified by what appears to be a heap of conspiracies, rebellions, and murders, driven by avarice, cruelty, rage, or ambition.
	The King ends by saying that it is clear that in English law, legislators can be full of vice, and that there are conflicts of interest that pervert the course of justice. Men are promoted for reasons other than their worth, and priests for reasons other than their holiness. Members of Parliament and advisors are not chosen for their love of their country or their wisdom. He concludes in Chapter VI that Gulliver's fellow men are a wicked and odious race.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver, a patriot, feels hurt at the King's damning judgment of his ""noble and beloved country."" To justify himself from possible censure from his readers, he points out that if anything, he exaggerated the positive in his account of England's government, and hid as many of the faults as he could. He hopes that his readers will make allowances for the King, as someone who has lived secluded from the rest of the world, and who is unfamiliar with the customs of other nations. He gives an example of the King's narrow-mindedness. Gulliver once tried to gain the King's favor by offering to teach him the method of making gunpowder, which is unknown in Brobdingnag, after describing its lethal effects in warfare. The King is horrified at such an inhumane idea. Although he is generally delighted by new discoveries, he does not wish to know such a secret, and commands Gulliver never to mention it again.
	Gulliver marvels at the King's lack of vision in turning down the opportunity to be master of the lives and fortunes of his people. He gives another example of the King's narrow principles: he cannot understand why the English should have produced so many books about the art of government, when governing was simply about justice and common sense.
	Gulliver describes the education of Brobdingnagians as ""defective."" They excel in morality, poetry, history, and mathematics, though they only apply this last discipline to improving agriculture and the mechanical arts. The number of laws in their country is not allowed to exceed the number of letters in their alphabet, and they are expressed in such clear language that interpretation is not in doubt. They know how to print, but do not have many books. One book suggests that Brobdingnagians were once much larger than they are now.
	Chapter VIII
	The King has given orders that any ship like the one in which Gulliver arrived should be sighted near the coast, it should be brought ashore and all the passengers taken to the capital city, Lorbrulgrud. The King wishes to find a mate for Gulliver, so that the couple can propagate the race. But though Gulliver feels he has been treated kindly in Brobdingnag, he is unwilling to create progeny who will be kept in cages like canaries and sold to people as curiosities. He wants to return to his native land.
	Gulliver has been in the country for two years when he and Glumdalclitch accompany the Queen on a progress. At the journey's end, Glumdalclitch and Gulliver are ill, and Gulliver persuades her to allow a pageboy to take him to the seaside for some fresh air. At the seashore, the boy leaves Gulliver sleeping in his box and goes off hunting for birds' eggs. Suddenly, a bird picks up Gulliver's box and flies off with it. The bird lets the box drop into the sea. For four hours, Gulliver is adrift in the ocean. Then, he feels the box being pulled along. A voice tells him the box is tied to a ship and that a carpenter will come and cut it open. Gulliver says that someone can simply put his finger into the ring on top of the box and haul it out of the sea. He hears laughter and realizes that he is among people of his own size.
	The carpenter arrives and cuts a hole in the box. A weakened Gulliver is brought onto the ship. It takes Gulliver some time to get used to the relatively small size of the people. He tells the captain his story, and shows him some things he has brought with him from Brobdingnag.
	Back in England, Gulliver is reunited with his wife, who tells him that he should never go to sea again.
	Analysis
	The conversation between Gulliver and the King covers many injustices and corruptions in the English governmental system and the judiciary. Many of these are still current in the early twenty-first century (witness the ""cash for honors"" scandal of 2006, when England's prime minister Tony Blair stands accused of selling positions in the House of Lords in return for undisclosed loans to the ruling Labour Party). As ever, Gulliver is presented as a na�ve reporter, and if anything, his views are colored by patriotism. The King is partly motivated in his questioning by an earnest desire to learn something that could be implemented in his own country for the benefit of the people. In addition, Gulliver's unopposed view of the King as ""a prince of excellent understanding,"" along with the King's incisive investigation into the government of England, alert the reader to Swift's intention that the King's famous conclusion should be taken seriously. Hence his severe judgment on what he sees as the abuses and corruption of England's government carries great satirical force. He pronounces, ""I cannot but conclude the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.""
	Gulliver's indignant response to the King's judgment reinforces the satirical purpose. His insistence that he exaggerated the positive in his account of England's government tells the reader that if he had told the complete truth, the King would have been even harsher in his conclusion. Gulliver is exposed as overly proud of his native country, which makes him dishonest and a hypocrite.
	Gulliver's supposed illustration of the King's narrow-mindedness in refusing to learn the destructive secret of gunpowder merely confirms to the reader the justice of the King's opinion of mankind as ""pernicious"" and ""odious."" In fact, the King's response is humane and morally responsible, but Gulliver can only see it as weakness. This is an example of dramatic irony, when the reader understands something to which a character (in this case, Gulliver) is blind.
advertisement
The Brobdingnagians are portrayed as having a more highly developed moral sense than Gulliver and his kind, and than the Lilliputians. Brobdingnagian society is not perfect, and the people do have vices, as, for example, the farmer's greed in exploiting Gulliver for profit. But unlike England, Brobdingnag has not incorporated the vices of individuals into government and law. The nation is fortunate in having a wise king, who has ensured that his wisdom will not pass away with him but is enshrined in laws and customs.

154,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part III Chapters I-III,"Summary
Chapter I
	Gulliver's desire to see the world and a financially lucrative offer prevails over his wife's pleas for him not to go to sea again, and he sets off on another voyage as ship's surgeon. His ship is boarded by pirates. Gulliver expects mercy from the Dutch pirate as he is a fellow Christian and Protestant, but it is the ""heathen"" Japanese pirate who shows more humanity, telling Gulliver that he will not die. The Dutch pirate is furious and sets Gulliver adrift in a canoe with meager rations, which the Japanese pirate augments. Gulliver sails to an island and sets up home in a cave.
The next day, Gulliver sees a large body about two miles high moving towards the island. As it draws closer, he notices that there are people moving up and down the sides of it and galleries and stairs built onto it. Gulliver shouts to them and they draw him up onto the flying island.
Chapter II
	Gulliver reflects that these are a strange-looking people, with heads leaning to one side and one eye turned inward, while the other looks upward. Their clothes are decorated with images of planets and musical instruments. The servants carry a bladder full of dried peas, with which they strike the mouths and ears of those around them. Gulliver discovers that the people are so preoccupied with intense speculations that they cannot speak or listen without first being roused by the flapper. Indeed, they repeatedly forget about Gulliver's presence and have to be reminded by the flappers.
Gulliver is taken to see the King of the island, called Laputa. The King is surrounded by globes and mathematical instruments, and is so preoccupied that he fails to notice Gulliver and his other visitors for an hour. When the King addresses Gulliver, a servant flaps his ear. When Gulliver points out that he does not need such attention, the people think he is weak-minded.
The Laputans give Gulliver dinner. All the food is cut into geometrical shapes. Gulliver is taught their language. A tailor arrives, measures his body precisely with mathematical instruments, and later delivers a suit of ill-fitting clothes.
The King orders that the island should be floated over towns and villages on the mainland so that he can receive his subjects' petitions.
The Laputans view everything in mathematical and musical concepts, so that they describe the beauty of a woman in terms of geometrical shapes or musical terminology. However, they despise practical geometry, so that there are no right angles in their houses, which are badly built. Though they are experts in drawing diagrams, they are impractical and cannot grasp any subject other than mathematics or music. They are also fond of debating politics in minute detail. They are obsessed by the movements of the celestial bodies, and live in perpetual fear that one will destroy them. The women of the island have no patience with their husbands and exploit their absent-mindedness by having affairs right under their noses. The women are only allowed to go to the mainland by special permission of the King, since many who leave do not return. The prime minister's wife once went to the mainland and hid for months, preferring to live in rags with a deformed footman who beat her than to return to her husband.
Chapter III
	Gulliver describes the physical characteristics of the island. The King is able to order that the island be raised above the level of clouds, so he can control how much rain the island receives. In the center of the island is a cave called the Astronomer's Cave, filled with astronomical instruments. Here too is a giant loadstone (magnet) which is manipulated in order to steer the island to different parts of the King's realm. The limitations of the technology of the loadstone means that the island cannot move beyond the extent of the realm, and neither can it rise above four miles.
The Laputans have better telescopes than are known in Europe, by which they see many more stars.
If a town rebels against the King or refuses to pay his taxes, he has two ways of reducing it to obedience. He can either float the island above the region, shutting out the sun and rain, or arrange for it to be pelted with rocks. If these methods do not work, he can drop the island on the town and crush the buildings and inhabitants. The Kings of this country have always been reluctant to do this, as the island could get damaged. Thus they drop the island on the people gently, out of a pretext of tenderness for them.
One rebellious city used their own magnet to try to force the island to descend in their midst, planning to kill the King and change the government. It took the King eight months to realize that the city was in rebellion, whereupon he ordered the island to hover above it and deprive it of rain and sun. The people had laid up provisions, so this did not work. The King then ordered them to be pelted with rocks, but they took refuge in strong towers. The King's technical advisors realized that if the island were to descend on the city, it would be trapped. The King was forced to give in to the city's demands.
By law, the King and his family are confined to the island.
Analysis
	Gulliver's stay in Laputa explores a different aspect of power from his stay in Lilliput or Brobdingnag. In Laputa, power is conferred not by superior size, but by technological knowledge, which becomes the instrument of oppression of the people. The Laputans have highly specialized knowledge of magnets that enables the King to dominate his realm from the relative safety of an island. He is remote from his subjects - it takes him eight months to realize that a city is in rebellion - so he does not understand their needs. Nevertheless, his control of the technology of the loadstone means that he holds the power of life or death over his subjects. The rebellious city regains some of its power by mastering the same technology that controls the King's island.
The Laputans' physical appearance reinforces the notion of their remoteness from the people living on the mainland. They have one eye turned inwards and the other heavenwards, and have to be roused with a flapper in order to speak or listen to another person. These characteristics symbolically reflect their lack of engagement with humanity and preoccupation with abstract thought. The custom of the flappers is deliberately ludicrous, emphasizing the foolishness and impracticality of the Laputans' outlook on life. It is significant that the island can only move within the limits of the King's domain and it can rise no higher than four miles: the same technology that gives the Laputans such power over the people also imprisons them within a restricted range. Mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, the Laputans are limited. They have no interests outside music (which they spend hours playing, to the exclusion of doing anything else), astronomy (which causes them only fear of cosmic accidents),
and mathematics (though they disdain the practical application of mathematics that would enable them to make clothes that fit or buildings that stand).
This section is Swift's satirical comment on the excesses of abstract thought and theoretical science that characterized the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment. In Laputa, humanity and practical considerations are sacrificed in pursuit of a cold intellectualism. The advanced technology that drives the island is not shared with the people to liberate them, but is used to enslave them.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Though Gulliver is not mistreated by the Laputans, they regard him with contempt because of his inferior understanding of music and mathematics. He finds them tedious companions and obtains permission from the King of Laputa to leave. He is let down into the capital city (called Lagado) of the mainland, a country called Balnibarbi, and takes a letter of introduction from the King of Laputa to the man who is to be his host, a lord called Munodi. Munodi takes Gulliver on a tour of the country. Gulliver sees miserable people in rags, buildings in disrepair, and workers in the fields, but no sign that they are producing any crops. Munodi takes Gulliver to his country estate, where the land is well cultivated and productive, and the house is beautifully built. He tells Gulliver that he may soon be forced to tear down his house and rebuild it according to Laputan standards, and to destroy his crops, if he is not to offend the King.
	Munodi explains what happened to the country. Forty years ago some people went up to Laputa and came back determined to reform the arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics. Academies to teach the new ideas were set up in most towns. In these academies, professors would invent new methods whereby, for example, one man could do the work of ten. None of the new methods worked; the land and country went to ruin; and the people are without food or clothes. Munodi and a few other gentry are not of an enterprising spirit: they continue to live in the houses their ancestors built, and to do things in the old and tried ways, but are disapproved of as ignorant and selfish. Munodi encourages Gulliver to visit the Academy, and Gulliver enthusiastically takes him up on the suggestion.
	Chapter V
	Gulliver visits the Academy of Lagado. He meets an inventor who is working on a project to extract sunbeams out of cucumbers in order to supply the Governor's gardens. He thinks he may have some success in eight years' time. He begs Gulliver to give him money because cucumbers are expensive. Gulliver has been supplied with money for the purpose by Munodi, who is familiar with the academicians' habit of begging.
	Another inventor is working on ways of reverse-engineering excrement into food. Another is trying to find a way of making spiders weave fabric of different colors by feeding them colored flies; yet another, a physician, tries to cure patients by blowing air up the anus. While Gulliver watches, he tries the technique on a dog, which dies.
	A professor is trying to teach his students to improve knowledge using a machine that rearranges words. He speculates that new books could be written in this way on many subjects without the need for intelligence or study. He intends to give the world a new body of arts and sciences, but believes the public should fund the project.
	At the school of languages, professors are working on shortening conversations by cutting out polysyllables and verbs, since only nouns are needed. The also have a project to abolish words altogether, as they believe that every word spoken shortens the life. Since words are names for things, an idea came up for men to carry about the objects that they need to express their purpose, but the women rebelled and quashed the project.
	At the mathematical school, a master is trying to teach mathematical proofs by writing them on wafers that are fed to the students.
	Chapter VI
	Gulliver feels depressed by what he has seen. The professors seem to him to be out of their minds. The people are pressing for an end to this senseless regime. They want the monarchs to choose favorites based on their wisdom and abilities; and they want the ministers to consult the public good.
	Gulliver meets a doctor who believes that government is like the individual physical body, in that both suffer from the same diseases. He proposes to take the pulse of each politician after a debate and administer a suitable medicine to each in order to shorten debates and calm conflict. Also, because the favorites of monarchs have bad memories, whoever addresses the chief minister should tweak him by the nose or tread on his corns, to prevent forgetfulness.
	Gulliver hears a debate between two professors about how to raise taxes without being unpopular. One idea is to tax every man's vice and folly, to be judged by his neighbors. Another is to allow people to set a taxable value on themselves according to how much wit, valor, and charm they possess: the more of these qualities they claim to have, the higher the tax they should pay. Virtues such as justice and honor, however, would not be taxed, as no man will allow that any other man has them, nor will he value them in himself.
	Gulliver finds the idea of staying in Lagado unattractive, and wants to return to England.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver wants to travel to Luggnagg, as from there he will be able to travel to Japan and thence to Europe. No ship will be ready for a month, so while he is waiting, he takes a trip to the island of Glubbdubdribb, which means the Island of Magicians. Gulliver meets the Governor, who has the power of calling up and dismissing attendants from the spirit world. The Governor gives Gulliver the chance to call up and question whomever he likes from among the dead. Gulliver chooses Alexander the Great, who tells him that he did not die of poison, but of excessive drinking.
	Chapter VIII
	Gulliver has the Governor call up the ancient Greek poet Homer and the philosopher Aristotle. He also arranges a visit from the French philosophers Ren� Descartes and Pierre Gassendi, whom he asks to explain their systems to Aristotle. Aristotle freely acknowledges his mistakes and explains that systems of explaining nature vary from age to age. Gulliver then questions a number of famous people from history, and finds that historians have misled posterity with lies. He also notes that wicked people have been promoted to positions of trust and responsibility, and that whores and parasites have influenced events. Conversely, Gulliver sees some virtuous people who have done good service to monarchs or countries, but who died in poverty and who were condemned as traitors by historians. By observing the ancestors of noble families, Gulliver is able to see how syphilis, once it has been introduced into the family line, causes each subsequent generation to degenerate.
	Chapter IX
	Gulliver travels to Luggnagg, where he is confined despite his desire to go to England. He is summoned by the King of Luggnagg. It is the custom at court for subjects to lick the floor, and the King gets rid of his enemies by strewing the floor with poison. The King is delighted with Gulliver, and arranges for him to stay at court for three months.
	Chapter X
	The Luggnaggians tell Gulliver about a sort of people among them who can never die. They are called Struldbrugs, or Immortals, and are distinguished by being born with a red spot on the forehead. Gulliver is envious, and arranges to meet them. One man asks Gulliver what he would do with his life if he were immortal. Gulliver, who has often mused on the subject, says that he would be the wealthiest, wisest, and most learned person in the kingdom, and he would become a great teacher of men, with the aim of preventing corruption in the world.
	The Luggnaggians laugh at him, and point out that though most humans think they desire immortality, Luggnaggians do not share the delusion, from the example of the Struldbrugs. Immortality, they explain, is not a matter of eternal youth and vigor, but an endless period of being afflicted with all the disorders of age. The Struldbrugs are like ordinary humans until they are about thirty, and thereafter become more depressed. They are incapable of affection or friendship. Their marriages are dissolved at the age of eighty, ""For the law thinks it a reasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned without any fault of their own to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their misery doubled by the load of a wife."" Also at eighty, their heirs immediately inherit their estate, with a small amount being held back to sustain them. By ninety, they have lost their memory, teeth, hair, and senses. Gulliver meets a few Struldbrugs, who appear to have no interest in anything and to be miserable. Gulliver loses his appetite for immortality.
	Chapter XI
	Gulliver refuses the King of Luggnagg's offer of employment and travels to Japan. From there, he travels to England, where he finds that his wife and family are well.
	Analysis
	In the character of Munodi, a man of sense in a senseless land, and in Gulliver's visit to the Academy, Swift continues to satirize the absurd pursuit of theoretical and abstract knowledge at the expense of common sense and practicality. While Munodi sticks to old and proven systems of architecture and agriculture, and as a result has a beautiful house and productive land, he is much disapproved of in the state, and faces being forced to destroy it in the name of ideology. The academicians, on the other hand, think up endless ingenious but pointless projects and are determined to reform systems that had worked very well before their meddling, while the people starve for lack of food.
advertisement
This section also presents Swift's views on why immortality is not a desirable state. The Struldbrugs do not grow in wisdom with old age, but become more incapable and less loving.
	Gulliver's meeting with famous historical figures raised from the spirit world gives Swift an opportunity to satirize what he saw as the lies of historians. History, he points out, is written by fallible people and is not impartial. The episode draws upon the Italian poet Dante Alighieri's fourteenth-century poem, ""Inferno,"" in which he travels through hell and sees sinners being punished.
",Gulliver's Travels
156,Gulliver's Travels: Novel Summary: Part IV Chapters I-III,"Summary
Chapter I
	Gulliver spends five months at home with his wife, and she is pregnant when he leaves to go to sea once more, this time as captain of a ship. Many of his crew die of illness and he is forced to recruit more. These turn out to be pirates who influence the rest of the crew to mutiny. They leave Gulliver on the shore of a strange country. As Gulliver begins to explore, he sees some strange, deformed creatures with goat-like beards and a ridge of hair down their backs and on part of their legs. They have long claws, which they use to climb trees. Gulliver is repulsed by the creatures' ugliness. When he meets one on his path, he strikes it with the flat of his sword. The beast roars, and many of its fellows flock to join it, climbing into trees and defecating on Gulliver.
Suddenly, they all run away, and Gulliver notices that a horse has arrived. The horse inspects Gulliver and neighs several times in different cadences. Another horse arrives, and the two seem to confer. They appear to be very rational creatures, so much so that Gulliver assumes they are magicians who have transformed themselves into horses. Gulliver asks the horses to take him to a house or village. The horses seem to use two words: ""Yahoo,"" and ""Houyhnhnm,"" which Gulliver learns to say. One horse leaves, and the other leads Gulliver off.
Chapter II
	The horse leads Gulliver to a house, in which several horses are sitting and going about domestic business. Gulliver reflects that if the animals here are so advanced, the human beings who civilized them must be the wisest in the world. One of the mares looks at him with contempt and says the word ""Yahoo"" to the others. He is led into the courtyard, where several of the ugly creatures he saw previously are tied up, eating dead animals. The horses compare Gulliver to these creatures, and Gulliver is shocked to realize that he does resemble them. One horse offers Gulliver some of the food that those creatures eat, which he politely rejects, and some of the horses' hay and oats, which he also rejects. Gulliver points to a cow, and the horses understand his meaning and give him milk to drink.
In this country, the horses ride in carriages drawn by Yahoos. An old horse arrives in one of these vehicles to dine with Gulliver and the horses. They try to work out what Gulliver will eat, and he suggests that they bring him some of their oats, from which he makes bread. He is given a place to sleep on straw.
Gulliver is to spend three years in this country.
Chapter III
	Gulliver learns the language of the horses, or Houyhnhnms, as their race is called. They ask him where he came from. When he tells them that he came in a boat from beyond the sea, they cannot believe that such things are possible. They are puzzled by Gulliver, as though he resembles the Yahoos, he is more teachable and rational than they. Gulliver begs them not to call him a Yahoo, as he feels utter contempt for those creatures, and they agree.
Analysis
	While Gulliver feels only disgust at the Yahoos' uncivilized behavior and tries to distance himself from them, it is clear that they are disturbingly close to humans in their nature. The rational Houyhnhnms carefully compare Gulliver with the Yahoos tethered in their yard and cannot easily tell the difference. When they see Gulliver naked, the only differences they note are that he has less hair and shorter claws, and walks on his hind legs. The similarity is underlined by Gulliver's unguarded comment in Chapter II that prefaces his judgment on ""those filthy Yahoos"": he says, ""there were few greater lovers of mankind, at that time, than myself."" This comment assumes that the Yahoos are essentially part of mankind. Pathetically, Gulliver clings to his clothes as one of the few proofs of his difference from the Yahoos he despises. Clothes are not an intrinsic part of humanity, but an addition that man has adopted in part as protection from shame about his body, a shame that the enlightened Houyhnhnms cannot comprehend.
Swift's satirical purpose in Part IV is assisted by his reversal of the usual roles of humans and horses in normal society. Gulliver is used to seeing horses serve humans, for instance, by pulling carriages. But in this land, horses ride in carriages pulled by human-like Yahoos, who act as the servants to the horses. In making the horses the rational creatures and the Yahoos ignorant and brutish, Swift is drawing attention to the baser aspects of human nature. He does not make this distinction clear from the beginning, having Gulliver mislead the reader by at first putting forward the idea that the horses are transformed magicians.
Swift gradually allows the reader to realize along with Gulliver, and through his eyes, that here, the horses are in charge of the Yahoos because they are the more advanced species.
Part IV represents a shift in the structure of Gulliver's Travels, which up to this point has shown Gulliver as too large, too small, or too practical for the societies he visits. In this country, he stands out because he is not rational enough. Swift is preparing the reader for his most severe condemnation of mankind.

Summary
	Chapter IV
	Gulliver explains that the Yahoos are the governing creatures in his country, a fact that the Houyhnhnms struggle to comprehend. Gulliver goes on to describe how the horses are fed and groomed, and how Yahoo servants are employed to look after them. The Houyhnhnms comment that whatever Gulliver claims about the subservient role of horses in his country, it is clear that in reality, the horses are the masters there too. But when Gulliver explains that horses owned by tradesmen are subjected to drudgery, the Houyhnhnms wonder how such a weak animal as a Yahoo can ride upon a Houyhnhnm, since it would be easy for the Houyhnhnm to throw off the Yahoo. Gulliver says that the horses are trained to accept human domination and are beaten if they disobey.
	Gulliver tells the Houyhnhnms the story of his life and how he came to their land. The Houyhnhnms find it difficult to understand the vices of the piratical crew members of the ship on which Gulliver arrived.
	Chapter V
	Gulliver tells his Houyhnhnm master about how society in England is organized, and the war between England and France. The Houyhnhnm asks about the causes of war in Gulliver's society. Gulliver says that sometimes, monarchs feel that they do not have enough land or people to govern; in other cases, wars are pursued to distract the citizens of a country from the evils of the government. Causes of war include differences of opinion, such as the views of Catholics and Protestants about whether the bread and wine used in the holy communion ritual are in reality the flesh and blood of Christ, or symbolic of it. Gulliver says it is considered justifiable to invade a country after it has been weakened by famine or civil unrest. If the people of the conquered country are poor and ignorant, it is thought acceptable to enslave them in order to civilize them. It is also considered acceptable for the leader of a country that helps another country drive out an invader to seize the country for himself.
	The Houyhnhnm says that it is lucky that nature has designed Gulliver's type of Yahoo in such a way that they are incapable of doing much harm to each other; their mouths and claws are unfit for fighting. Gulliver smiles at his ignorance and describes the weapons and ammunition that are used in war, including gunpowder, pistols, and cannons. With these, he explains, it is possible to blow up a hundred enemies at once. The Houyhnhnm is disturbed. He does not blame the Yahoos of his own country for their brutal behavior, as that is their nature, but he can see no excuse for a creature ""pretending to reason"" to act thus.
	The Houyhnhnm asks Gulliver to explain what he meant when he said that some of his ship's crew left England as a result of being ruined by law. Law, the Houyhnhnm points out, is meant to sustain life, not destroy it. Gulliver explains the abuses of law in human society. He says a lawyer is a person who is paid to argue that white is black and black is white, and who is more skilled at defending falsehood than justice. It is held among lawyers that any decision that has been made by a court in the past may be made again (the rule of precedent), however unjust it may be. Lawyers use a jargon that no one else can understand. They have encouraged the proliferation and over-complexity of laws. This serves their interest, as it can take years, and correspondingly large legal fees, to settle a case. In the cases of alleged crimes against the state, the judge first finds out the government's view, and passes sentence accordingly.
	Chapter VI
	The Houyhnhnm cannot understand what could motivate lawyers to injure their fellow humans. Gulliver explains the concept of money, which the Houyhnhnms do not have. Money, Gulliver says, enables a Yahoo to buy the finest properties, clothes, and foods, and to have his choice of the most beautiful women. In sum, no Yahoo thinks he has enough of it. He says that for every rich man, there are a thousand poor, and the rich live off the labor of the poor. When Gulliver remarks that the ingredients for rich people's meals have to be transported around the globe, the Houyhnhnm says that England must be very miserable if it cannot be self-sufficient in food. Gulliver says that on the contrary, England produces three times as much food as its inhabitants could consume, but most is exported in return for imports of luxury goods that satisfy the greed and vice of wealthy people. An example is wine, which only serves to create illness and early death.
	Gulliver finds it difficult to explain illness to the Houyhnhnm, as it is unknown in their society. The Houyhnhnm says that nature, which works all things to perfection, cannot allow disease to take hold of the body. Gulliver tells him that humans abuse their bodies through harmful habits that disrupt digestion. He says that they acquire syphilis from sexual relations with prostitutes, and that the disease is passed down through generations. Gulliver goes on to detail the frequently destructive medical armory of the doctors of his time, including purgatives and emetics. Some diseases, he says, are imaginary, and the doctors have invented imaginary cures for them. In the case of serious diseases, the doctors predict death, and are proved correct, since while they cannot cure the patient, they can always kill him with toxic medicine. Many doctors are employed as poisoners by people who have wearied of their spouses.
	Gulliver describes the qualities needed in a chief minister in the government (the equivalent of the modern prime minister or president of a country). The most important quality is hypocrisy. For example, if the candidate publicly attacks the corruption of the court, the monarch will choose him as chief minister because he knows that such zealots always prove most subservient. The minister preserves himself in power by bribing Members of Parliament. He is able to remain unaccountable to the public because of an Act of Parliament (the Act of Indemnity) that makes him immune to prosecution, and he retires laden with wealth that he has stolen from the nation.
	The Houyhnhnm feels sure that Gulliver must have been born into a noble family, because he is cleaner and better-looking than most of his fellow Yahoos. Gulliver corrects him, pointing out that he misunderstands the concept of nobility as it exists in England. There, young noblemen are brought up to be idle and end up marrying an unhealthy and unpleasant woman for her money. So weak and diseased is the nobility that if a nobleman is healthy and robust, he is suspected of being the illegitimate offspring of a groom or coachman. Yet such nobles, in Parliament's House of Lords, have the power to decide the laws of the nation.
	Chapter VII
	Gulliver defends himself against possible accusations that he is representing humankind too honestly to the Houyhnhnms, who are predisposed by their familiarity with Yahoos to a negative opinion of humans. He confesses that living among the Houyhnhnms has inspired in him such love and respect for them that he has no wish to return to human society. Nevertheless, he feels that he has portrayed his own society to the Houyhnhnms in as positive a light as he could.
	Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master gives his verdict on Gulliver's fellow man, saying that although he seems to be endowed with a pittance of reason, he only misuses it to corrupt himself. In addition, man appears to lack those natural abilities that Yahoos possess, such as agility. He adds that man's institutions of government and law plainly lack reason and virtue. He considers that the causes of dissent among Yahoos are the same as among humans, particularly greed, since if a group of Yahoos were given enough food for fifty, each would want to keep it all for himself. Moreover, groups of Yahoos fight their neighbor Yahoos with no cause, and if they lack an external enemy, they fight amongst themselves.
	Yahoos are fond of shiny stones, which they dig up and hoard in their kennels, while worrying constantly lest their fellows should find their treasure. The Houyhnhnm cannot understand the Yahoos obsession with these useless stones, but he believes that their behavior is similar to avarice among humankind. The Houyhnhnm adds that Yahoos are given to consuming a root that intoxicates them, as wine does humans, which makes them either hug or fight one another. Yahoos, like humans, are subject to diseases of excess.
	Each herd of Yahoos has a leader, who is uglier and more mischievous than his fellows, and who is skilled at licking the feet and posterior of his Houyhnhnm master. He is hated by his fellow Yahoos and when he is finally forced from office, the other Yahoos defecate on him. Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master leaves Gulliver to decide whether this relates to human court favorites and government ministers.
	The Houyhnhnm mentions the Yahoo habit of sitting and howling in a corner for no reason. The only remedy is to set the Yahoo to hard work. Gulliver recognizes this as a disease of wealthy and idle Englishmen, which is known as spleen. The Houyhnhnm describes the odd behavior of female Yahoos, which Gulliver recognizes as (in his view) the human female tendencies of flirting, blaming and judging others, and malicious gossip.
	Analysis
	This section of the book marks a change in Gulliver's attitude to his fellow men. While previously, he has assumed a certain superiority to the people around him (who, unnoticed by him, are caricatures of people from his own society), under the influence of the rational Houyhnhnms, he now feels disgust at his own kind. Humans are portrayed as being worse than Yahoos, since Yahoos are not rational and therefore have no choice but to act in a bestial manner, but humans pretend to rationality and therefore have a choice as to how to act. That humans should choose greed, avarice, and hypocrisy over the selfless rationality
advertisement
exemplified by the Houyhnhnms is shown as morally reprehensible as well as absurd.
	Yahoo qualities that are described in order to satirize human vices include greed, avarice, and an aggression that leads Yahoos to fight their own kind. The flirtatious and malicious behavior of female Yahoos is also calculated to reflect the behavior of female humans. The despicable behavior of leader Yahoos reflects the hypocrisy of government officials in human society.

Summary
	Chapter VIII
	With a servant Houyhnhnm as his guard Gulliver goes to investigate the Yahoos to see whether they are similar to humans. He finds them smelly, unteachable, and cruel. A female Yahoo sees Gulliver naked and leaps upon him in a fit of lust. This convinces Gulliver that he must be a Yahoo, since the females desire him as they would one of their own species.
	Gulliver describes the principles of the Houyhnhnms. They are naturally virtuous, cultivate reason, and have no concept of anything evil. They act with friendship and kindness towards their fellows, and the only factor that makes them give a distinction to any particular Houyhnhnm is if he is unusually virtuous.
	In order to avoid overpopulation, Houyhnhnms only mate to produce one offspring of each sex. Genetically inferior Houyhnhnms, who are destined to be servants, are allowed to breed three offspring of each sex to serve in noble families. They are careful to make matches that preserve the strength and good health of the race as a whole. Courtship and romantic love have no place in the process, but the couple displays the same kindness and respect to each other as to the rest of their race.
	Female Houyhnhnms receive the same education as the males, and they are brought up to behave virtuously. All Houyhnhnms receive physical education to make them strong and healthy.
	Every four years, the Houyhnhnms hold a council to identify any food shortages in the districts, which are immediately rectified.
	Chapter IX
	A council of the Houyhnhnms is held at which it is discussed whether to exterminate the Yahoos from the face of the earth. The case for extermination is that the Yahoos destroy the Houyhnhnms's crops and steal their milk. They are only useful for carriage, a role that could be performed by asses, which are less troublesome.
	Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master suggests that they could castrate the Yahoos at an early age, as Gulliver's people castrate their horses, to make them tame and to put an end to their race without taking life. Meanwhile the Houyhnhnms could begin to domesticate asses.
	The Houyhnhnms have no written language. However, they are skilled in herbal medicine, practical astronomy, and poetry. Their poetry is geared towards inspiring readers to greater virtue or physical excellence.
	Houyhnhnms (in the absence of accidents) die of old age. Their friends and relatives express neither joy nor grief at their departure, as they believe that death is simply a return to the ""first mother.""
	Houyhnhnms have no word to express anything evil. They describe mistakes or unpleasant events by adding the word ""Yahoo"" to the word or phrase.
	Chapter X
	Gulliver is happy living a simple life among the Houyhnhnms. He dresses in animal skins and is relieved to have no contact with the follies and vices of human society. Gulliver feels privileged to be allowed to listen to the conversation of his Houyhnhnm master, which contains much wisdom. He comes to love and respect the Houyhnhnm race. He thinks of his family, friends, and countrymen as Yahoos. As he feels that he is himself a Yahoo, he is filled with self-disgust.
	One day, Gulliver's Houyhnhnm master summons him and tells him that at the council, the other Houyhnhnms had voiced their disapproval of his keeping a Yahoo (Gulliver) as a member of his family. This was contrary to reason and nature, so the Houyhnhnms had decided that Gulliver should either be employed like the rest of the Yahoos or sent back from whence he came. They fear that Gulliver's rudiments of reason will make him a dangerous leader who could raise the Yahoos in rebellion against the Houyhnhnms.
	Gulliver is grief-stricken at the prospect of leaving the Houyhnhnms and going back to England to live among Yahoos. He takes his leave of his Houyhnhnm master and sets sail in a boat he has constructed.
	Chapter XI
	At sea in his boat, Gulliver hopes to find an uninhabited island where he can live, rather than return to England. He finds what he believes is such an island, goes ashore, and sets up home. On the fourth day, he sees some natives, who fire an arrow at him and wound him in the knee. Gulliver escapes in his boat and goes ashore next to a creek on the same island. A ship draws near and sends some men ashore to get fresh water. They discover Gulliver and address him in Portuguese. Gulliver baffles them by describing himself as a Yahoo and by his manner of speech, which resembles the neighing of a horse. They tie Gulliver up and take him on board their ship. The captain, Don Pedro de Mendez, treats Gulliver with great courtesy.
	Gulliver tries to escape by leaping overboard rather than live among Yahoos, but is recaptured. Don Pedro gently explains that he only wants to help Gulliver. Gulliver tells the story of his life among the Houyhnhnms. Eventually, Don Pedro begins to believe him. Gulliver passes the journey trying to avoid contact with the crew because he has developed an aversion to humankind. He refuses Don Pedro's offer to lend him his best clothes, but Gulliver cannot bear to wear anything that has clothed a Yahoo. The ship arrives at Lisbon and Don Pedro accommodates Gulliver as his guest in his house. At first, Gulliver is too terrified of humans to venture outside. After some time, he agrees to go out in the company of Don Pedro, but insists on blocking his nose with herbs or tobacco to lessen the unpleasant smell of humankind.
	Don Pedro persuades a reluctant Gulliver to return England. He does so, but feels only disgust at his wife and family. For a year, he cannot tolerate their presence. He buys two horses and converses with them in their stable for four hours each day.
	Chapter XII
	Gulliver concludes his story by asserting the truth of his account and condemns those travel writers who lie and embellish. His motive, he says, is to serve the public good by drawing attention to the virtues of the Houyhnhnms and thereby to the vices of humankind. He adds that among the Yahoo nations, the least corrupted are the Brobdingnagians.
	Gulliver is pleased that his work can meet with no criticism or blame, for all he has done is relate the plain facts, without his own opinions.
	Gulliver has been advised that he must give an account of his discoveries to the Secretary of State, as any lands that are discovered by an English subject belong to the Crown (monarch). He has not done so, as it is not worth sending an army to conquer Lilliput, and it would not be safe or wise to invade Brobdingnag, Laputa, or the land of the Houyhnhnms. In addition, he does not wish to bring the violence and destruction of an invasion upon these nations. He quickly adds that he does not accuse the English of such behavior, as they are well known for their wisdom and justice in establishing colonies. But the nations he has visited do not wish to be conquered and enslaved, nor do they possess any valuable minerals or crops that the English government might be interested in, so he sees no point in making such a report.
	Recently, Gulliver has begun to allow his wife to sit at dinner with him, but he has to block his nose with herbs to disguise the smell. Perhaps one day, he may be able to tolerate the company of a fellow Yahoo. He finds himself particularly provoked by the combination of vices and pride in humankind. Houyhnhnms, though they are virtuous, utterly lack pride, and he hopes that any human who possesses this absurd vice will refrain from coming near him.
	Analysis
	The Houyhnhnm society is similar to that of the ancient Spartans, which, by the 5th century B.C., was the most powerful nation among all of Greece's city-states. Both societies had no written literature, but passed down laws and customs orally. Both societies emphasized morality and the importance of doing that which is right. Both societies regulated childbirth in the interests of society as a whole: the Spartans left weak or malformed babies to die to keep the race genetically strong, and the Houyhnhnms choose their mates with a similar aim. Both societies had the state educate children; both emphasized physical fitness, though with the Spartans, this last custom had a military purpose not shared with the Houyhnhnms.
	Though Gulliver describes the rational Houyhnhnm society with complete approval, it has attracted negative views from some modern critics and readers. In this society, the individual is subjugated to the interests of society as a whole. Houyhnhnms choose their mates for the good of the race, not out of personal preference, and feel no special emotions for their mates or children. Families with a surplus of children pass them, with complete equanimity, to another family that has a vacancy. They do not grieve for dead loved ones.
	This is a society, some critics point out, that is completely without the conflicts, hatreds, passions, strong preferences, and loves that define the texture of human society and that distinguish humans so markedly from one another. It is no coincidence, these critics add, that the Houyhnhnms are the only race visited by Gulliver who do not possess individual names. One Houyhnhnm is completely indistinguishable from another.
	No man can be entirely a Houyhnhnm (rational) or entirely a Yahoo (bestial). But he can be a Don Pedro. Don Pedro exemplifies such human virtues as kindness, charity, compassion, and generosity. Gulliver, who has been warped out of his humanness through excessive exposure to the Houyhnhnms, is blind to Don Pedro's goodness simply because the man does not look like a horse.
advertisement
The reader, who does not share Gulliver's fit of insanity, can appreciate it.
	There is irony in Gulliver's final condemnation of his fellow humans because of their pride. This is because Gulliver himself has become insufferably proud, feeling superior to everyone else because of his over-identification with the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver is not, and can never be, a Houyhnhnm, as is clear from their expulsion of him from their realm on the grounds that he is not one of them.

159,A Tale of Two Cities: Summary,"
Book I Chapter 1-4
The narrator begins his story in the year 1775 with the observation that ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" and concludes that it was a period in all respects much like the one nearly 70 years later from which the tale is being told. The narrator observes that there were kings and queens in England and France and that the aristocrats in both countries found little reason to expect any change in their status. At this time the English Crown received reports of unrest from its American colonies and in France the aristocracy continued its trend of overspending at the expense of its working poor. Criminals in both countries were dealt harsh physical punishment for even the smallest of crimes. In England, there were frequent highway robberies and corruption allowed the practice to flourish.
On a particularly foggy night in 1775 the mail coach from London to Dover is struggling up a muddy hill. The coach's three nervous passengers walk beside the coach in order to lighten the load for the horses on the grade. The passengers are thickly wrapped and unrecognizable in the fog. Finally, the coach reaches the summit and as the coachmen opens the door for the passengers he hears the sound of a horse approaching. He draws his pistol and expects the worst. Amid much anxiety and suspicion the approaching rider requests an audience with Mr. Jarvis Lorry, one of the passengers, who identifies himself and asks if the rider is a man named Jerry. Learning that this is the case, Mr. Lorry reassures the skittish coach drivers and receives the written message. Mr. Lorry identifies himself to the drivers as a member of Tellson's Bank of London on his way to that company's Paris branch. He reads aloud the brief message: ""Wait at Dover for Mam'selle"" and sends the brief reply, ""Recalled to life."" Jerry departs for London, by way of several roadside ale-houses, with the strange answer and the coach continues on to Dover. As he rides, Jerry muses that he would be in a ""bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion.""
Back in the coach, Mr. Lorry holds onto a leather strap, which secures him against the jolting road and allows him to fitfully doze during the journey. He dreams that he is walking in the underground storerooms of Tellson's but in the dream he knows that he is going to dig someone out of their grave. He inquires several times of the spectre how many years it remained entombed and receives the unvarying answer: ""Almost eighteen years."" When he asks the apparition if it is glad to be recalled to life, it answers, ""I can't say."" In the dream he digs to free the buried man but just as the body is unearthed it crumbles to dust. Mr. Lorry awakes in the coach and lowers the window to feel the real rain and mist on his face. The dream repeats often during the journey until Mr. Lorry realizes that the day is breaking.
At noon, when the mail coach reaches Dover, Mr. Lorry is the only remaining passenger because the other two men alighted at points along the road. After confirming that a packet ship will leave for Calais, France the following day, Mr. Lorry instructs the head drawer at the Royal George hotel to prepare a bedroom for himself and orders a barber and breakfast. Mr. Lorry emerges from his room clean and shaven and is revealed to be of about sixty years of age and formally dressed in a plain and worn but well-cared-for suit. He takes his breakfast alone before the fire and briefly dozes before his meal arrives. He instructs the drawer to prepare lodgings for a young lady who may arrive at any time that day. A brief but friendly exchange with the waiter reveals that there is much traveling between Tellson's branches, though Mr. Lorry himself has not traveled to Paris in nearly fifteen years. Mr. Lorry spends the day walking the beach, alone with his thoughts. That evening after dinner orders a bottle of claret and just before finishing the wine he hears the sound of an approaching carriage and rightly surmises that it is the Mam'selle he has been expecting. The waiter announces her as Miss Manette and conveys her wish to see him immediately.
Mr. Lorry follows the waiter to a darkly furnished room where he meets Miss Manette, a very pretty girl about seventeen years old. He is reminded of a little girl he carried in his arms aboard the packet from Calais to England many years before. Miss Manette relates that she has received a message informing her that a recent discovery regarding her deceased father (whom she never saw in life) has been made and that she must travel to her native land of France. She asks if she may place herself under Mr. Lorry's protection for the journey and he readily assents. She was told that the discovery is of a very surprising nature and that the bank's representative, namely Mr. Lorry, would reveal it to her. Mr. Lorry is somewhat disconcerted at the prospect but begins to relate the story of one of his customers when he worked at Tellson's French branch nearly twenty years prior. Miss Manette soon discerns that Mr. Lorry is speaking of her own father, a man of science, and she also gleans that it was Mr. Lorry himself who brought her to England soon after her mother's subsequent death. Mr. Lorry admits that all that is true but asserts that he is a man of business and his relations with people are business in nature and devoid of strong emotional attachment. He continues his story by suggesting that the fictional character he has invented to stand in the place of Dr. Manette did not die but instead imprisoned with no appeal or outside communication. This information causes Miss Manette to swoon with emotion, but she begs Mr. Lorry to continue his story. After appealing to her to be business-minded about the affair, Mr. Lorry proceeds to tell her that her father has been found alive but greatly affected and changed by long years of imprisonment. Miss Manette reflects that she will be going to see a ghost but Mr. Lorry encourages her to be strong and that perhaps her influence will bring her poor father to reason. He tells her that her father is now under another name and she should not speak his true name aloud while in France, but he then notices that she is not listening but has sunk into a chair and become catatonic.
Mr. Lorry calls for help and a large, redheaded woman, Lucie's guardian Miss Pross, comes running into the room and shoves him away. She orders smelling salts, cold water and vinegar and affectionately fawns over Miss Manette. She castigates the flummoxed man of finances for frightening such a fragile girl.
Analysis of Chapters 1-4
The opening commentary attempts to connect the time in which the novel is set the latter half of the eighteenth century, with that of Dickens' contemporary audience. The grand superlative ambiguities, ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times,"" would be recognizable readers from any age and serves to introduce one of the novel's great themes, that the quality of life is relative to the perspective from which it is drawn. It may have also served as notice to Dickens' regular readers that this story was going to be different from his others, which were set during Dickens' own era. Mirroring the extremes of the introductory section the story begins with the juxtaposition of two opposites: the carriage's slow laborious climb to the top of the hill and the suspense of the dangerous times and the approach of a strange rider through the fog. His claim that he maintains a business-minded outlook and resists emotional involvement is contradicted by his troubled dreams which belie a degree of nervousness about his current errand. Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a man of levelheaded business sensibility is a likable character, typical of the Dickens oeuvre. His memory of carrying Miss Manette over the Channel as a child belies his sympathies for her and his advice that she maintain a business outlook on the situation only serves to reveal his own emotional state. Miss Pross' accusation that he has intentionally frightened the poor girl so undermines his original intent as to make him seem humorous.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 5-6
The scene is the squalid street outside a wine shop in the poverty-stricken Saint Antoine district of Paris. A cask of red wine has been spilled in the street and hungry peasants use various means to sop and drink the mixture of wine and mud before it soaks away. The narrator describes these people as desperate and haggard from long years of deprivation and hunger. One of the peasants, a tall joker named Gaspard, uses the wine to write the word ""BLOOD"" on a wall but the owner of the wine shop, Monsieur Defarge, fails to appreciate the intended humor and rubs out the word with some mud. Monsieur Defarge returns to his shop where his wife sits with her knitting at rest while she picks her teeth. She gives a short cough to let her husband know to look about the shop for some new customers. He sees an older man and a young girl sitting in the back of the shop but ignores them for the moment in order to discourse with three men drinking at the counter. They exchange doleful observations of the wretched condition of the people and refer to each other by the name ""Jacques."" Monsieur Defarge offers to show the three men a bachelor-style apartment on the fifth floor but then remembers that one of them has been there before and can lead the others to it. After the Jacques depart, the elderly man approaches Defarge. The elderly man is Mr. Lorry and as he and Miss Manette follow Defarge up a steep staircase he makes several inquiries regarding the health of Miss Manette's father who is living in the garret. Mr. Lorry is dispirited by Defarge's response. At the top Mr. Lorry is surprised to find that Defarge must use a key to open the door but Defarge observes that the former prisoner would be frightened if left in an unlocked room. Miss Manette is afraid to enter but Mr. Lorry admonishes her to have courage and see to the business at hand. They come upon the three men from the shop looking through a chink in the wall and Mr. Lorry, somewhat angrily, asks Defarge the why he chooses to make a show of Dr. Manette. Defarge replies that it is best if some select people see the doctor. They enter the dim and dark apartment where an old man with white hair is bent before the feeble light of a solitary window making shoes.
Defarge opens the window wider and the additional light reveals the haggard dress and sunken visage of the shoemaker who returns to his work. Mr. Lorry comes near the man and Defarge prompts the shoemaker to describe his work while Mr. Lorry examines the shoe. At Defarge's prompting, the shoemaker gives his name as ""One Hundred and Five, North Tower."" Upon further prompting the shoemaker reveals that he became a shoemaker only after many requests to teach himself the trade and even then with much difficulty. Mr. Lorry calls the shoemaker by name, Monsieur Manette, and the old man drops his work and briefly struggles to remember his visitor but soon returns to his work. During this conversation, Miss Manette moves through the shadows to a position near her father who eventually notices her. He is deeply affected by the sight of her and though he does not know who she is he examines her hair. He pulls from around his neck a locket with a few strands of hair like her own and tries to figure out who she might be. Finally he decides that she cannot be his wife and asks her name. He is deeply affected by the sound of his voice as she explains with great emotion that she has come to take him to England. By the end of her speech his head is resting on her breast and the pair have collapsed to the floor. With her father cradled in her arms, Miss Manette beseeches Mr. Lorry to prepare their departure immediately. Mr. Lorry and Defarge leave to obtain the necessary papers and transportation. The daughter and father are left alone for some time and then Mr. Lorry and Defarge return with food and traveling cloaks. Though Dr. Manette is evidentially comforted by his daughter's presence he is bewildered and believes himself to be leaving the prison as they depart the shop. They succeed in transferring Dr. Manette to a waiting coach but he then asks for his shoemaking tools. Madame Defarge, who stands nearby but ""saw nothing"", retrieves the tools from the garret. They quickly make their way to the Barrier where Defarge leaves them to their journey. They travel all night under stars that, just before dawn, seem to ask Mr. Lorry the same question: ""I hope you care to be recalled to life"" but he receives the same reply: ""I can't say.""
Analysis of Chapters 5-6
This section describes the miserable condition of the peasants in Paris during the period and Gaspard's graffiti foreshadows the revolution that is soon to come. The Defarge's wine shop is revealed to be more than simply a drinking house in the society of Jacques that meet there and the obvious understanding between Defarge and his wife hints at the deeper role they will play in the coming violence. Monsieur Defarge's insistence that some men are better for having seen the wretched condition of doctor Manette also serves to illustrate the work he is doing to proliferate discontent among those who would organize the overthrow of the current system. Miss Manette's instant connection with her father belies their shared blood and brings the first ray of hope into the miserable doctor's bleak existence. Doctor Manette's attempts to understand his daughter's identity are the first steps he takes in recovering his senses though Mr. Lorry's dream that the unearthed man still cannot say whether or not he cares to be recalled to life belies the uncertainty of that recovery and the various trials that the doctor will undergo if he is to return to normal.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 1-3
It is five years later, the year 1780, and Tellson's Bank of London remains an old-fashioned place, proud of its smallness, darkness, ugliness and inconveniences. The old partners in the firm suffer no improvements and in this way mirror England as a whole. Death is meted out for all offenses, whether it be unlawfully opening a letter or stealing a horse. Though this policy increases rather than decreases crime it has the very satisfactory effect of dispensing with each case forever. All the men who work at Tellson's are old. The bank employs an odd-job man, named Jerry Cruncher, who waits outside its door ready at a moment's notice for whatever errand that he is assigned. While he is on these errands his son (age twelve) waits in his father's place. Mr. Cruncher's apartment, which he shares with his wife and son, consists of two cramped rooms that are very neatly kept by Mrs. Cruncher (first name Aggerawayter). He awakes one morning in 1780 to find his wife praying, or as he indecorously calls it ""flopping"", which he claims works against him. He throws a muddy boot at his wife and advises his son that his mother is praying away their income and food. The boy keeps an eye on his mother while his father cleans his unaccountably muddy boots. At breakfast, Jerry angrily stops his wife from saying a blessing over the meal claiming he won't have his ""wittles blest off [the] table."" Just before nine o'clock he and young Jerry (who like his father has spikes of hair upon his head) encamp themselves in front of Tellson's to wait for any work that might arise. Soon there comes a call for a porter and the elder Cruncher leaves the younger to ponder why his father always has iron rust on his hands.
Jerry is sent to the Old Bailey courthouse with a message for Mr. Lorry. He is instructed to make his presence known and then wait until Mr. Lorry needs him. Before Jerry leaves the clerk tells him that the Bailey is trying treason cases that day. Jerry observes that the punishment for that offense is quartering which he calls ""barbarous."" The old clerk responds that Jerry had better respect the law which is immutable and for the best. Using the note provided by the clerk, Jerry gains admittance to the courtroom (a privilege for which most people paid money) and is informed that the man to stand trial will most assuredly be found guilty. As instructed, he attracts Mr. Lorry's attention and then waits to be entertained by the trial.
When the prisoner enters the room everyone carefully examines him except a wigged gentleman sitting with the defense counsel. This man stares at the ceiling. The accused man is about twenty-five years old with dark good looks and the bearing of a gentleman. The judge announces that the accused, Charles Darnay by name, has pled ""Not Guilty"" against charges that he is a traitor in the service of the French king. The prisoner's eyes stray, and those of the spectators with them, to a young woman and her father who are seated beside the Judge's bench. The young woman obviously sympathizes with the prisoner. The spectators wonder who the father and daughter are and what part they will play in the trial. Standing far in the back of the room, Jerry learns that the father and daughter are called there as witnesses for the prosecution.
Using very grand language, the prosecuting Attorney General states that the prisoner has been engaged in traitorous activities against their king and that the prosecution will produce unimpeachable, patriotic witnesses to attest to the prisoner's guilt. Furthermore, the Attorney General states that these witnesses have procured treasonous documents that, though admittedly not in the prisoner's handwriting, will prove that the prisoner has been monitoring the England's military forces for at least five years.
Several witnesses are called. The first is a man named John Barsad, who claims to be a gentleman and corroborates the Attorney General's assertion. Upon being cross-examined, however, he is revealed to be a gambler and is made to seem ridiculous when he is made to recall being pushed for cheating and then falling down a staircase on his own volition. The defense attorney implies that Barsad may hope to profit by his testimony by receiving employment as a government spy. The next witness, the prisoner's former servant Roger Cly, also asserts that his motives in procuring the lists were purely patriotic. He testifies that the prisoner has traveled between England and France often. The defense casts suspicion upon his motives, however, when it reveals that Cly has known John Barsad much longer than he has served the accused man. The third witness is Mr. Lorry who is unable to say whether the prisoner was one of the men who shared the Dover mail coach five years before but testifies that Darnay did come aboard the return ship from France soon after midnight when he returned with Lucie and Doctor Manette. The Attorney General questions Miss Manette and she testifies that the prisoner helped her find shelter for her father and was very kind and considerate at the time. Under questioning she is forced to admit that she did witness the prisoner exchange some papers with some French gentlemen before boarding the ship and that while on board he made a joke about George Washington achieving as much fame as the English King George III. Dr. Manette is questioned about the journey but admits that he can not remember the crossing due to mental sickness at the time. The prosecution then tries to prove that Darnay took the Dover mail coach and alighted early in order to glean the strength of a nearby garrison. The last witness is a man who swears that on the night in question he saw the prisoner in a particular coffee-room near Dover. The wigged gentleman staring at the ceiling passes a note to the defense attorney who, after reading the note, asks the witness if his learned friend who just passed him the note looks just like the prisoner. Everyone in the courtroom is immediately struck by the previously unnoticed similarity, and the witness admits that the man does resemble Darnay. The judge asks Mr. Stryver (the defense attorney) if the purpose of this is to put his partner Mr. Carton on trial and Mr. Stryver replies that he is attempting to cast doubt upon the witness' memory. The similarity between the two men succeeds in destroying the witness' credibility.
The defense and prosecution sum up their cases and the judge, who obviously favors the prosecution, adds his observations. Jerry Cruncher remarks to his neighbor that Mr. Carton, who continues to look at the ceiling, probably doesn't get much law work. At this moment, Mr. Carton cries out that Miss Manette is in danger of fainting. She and her father are escorted from the room and the jury, unable to reach an immediate decision, retires to consider its verdict. Mr. Carton asks Mr. Lorry about the young lady's condition and learns that she will recover. He offers to take this information to the prisoner. Carton asks Darnay what verdict he expects to receive. Mr. Carton agrees with Darnay that it would be best to expect the worst, but offers the observation that the jury's failure to reach an immediate verdict should be taken as a positive sign. An hour and a half later the jury returns and Mr. Lorry calls for Jerry to take the message ""ACQUITTED"" back to Tellson's.
Analysis of Chapters 1-3
This section serves to introduce Jerry Cruncher, a decidedly comic figure but also a representation of the English urban peasantry at the time. He is a relatively simple man who is seemingly content and vigilant in his position as Tellson's only trusted messenger. He is determined to provide food for himself and his family and the hints, such as the rust on his hands or mud on his boots, that he may have a more dishonorable occupation as well, that he has another, secret occupation serve to underscore his devotion to his stomach. Significantly, Dickens uses Cruncher as his perspective on Charles Darnay's theater-like trial, which is portrayed to be little more than entertainment for the mob. As such, Charles Darnay's trial is a grand play attended by a rapt audience with only Sydney Carton uninterested in the result. Carton displays interest in his surroundings first when he notices the similarity between himself and Charles Darnay and later when he notices that Miss Manette is about to faint. In both instances his thoughts can be attributed to where his interest most lies, namely himself and his desires. His later dialogue with Darnay reveals that he considers himself to be beyond redemption and, as such, free to give his opinion with regard for another's welfare or feelings.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 4-5
Outside the court Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry discuss the trial. After kissing Lucie's hand, Mr. Darnay thanks Mr. Stryver who has pushed his way into the group. Mr. Lorry sees Dr. Manette look somewhat fearfully and curiously at Charles Darnay. Soon the doctor and his daughter depart. Sydney Carton approaches the group. He is a little drunk and smells of port wine. Mr. Carton upsets Mr. Lorry by explaining that he, Mr. Carton, has no business and even that even if he did he would not attend to it. Mr. Lorry asserts that business is what guides one's life and departs in a huff. Sydney Carton takes Darnay to a nearby tavern to dine and drink. Carton proceeds to get more inebriated and chides Darnay for the obvious affection that Lucie Manette showed for him on the stand. His line of questioning leads to the assertion that he doesn't particularly care for Darnay. Before Darnay departs, Sydney Carton confides to him that he is a drunk because he cares for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for him. After Darnay leaves he orders another pint of port and gives orders to be awoken at 10pm. He questions himself in a mirror and tells himself that he hates Darnay because the remarkable similarity in their appearance reminds him of what he has not become. He falls asleep on his arm at the table.
The narrator observes that those were drinking days in London and Mr. Stryver, who was tireless in his pursuit of professional success and advancement, was like his counterpart Sydney Carton a heavy drinker. Carton rendered service to Stryver in all night drinking sessions where he would review Carton's upcoming cases and distill the essence from the various statements, a task his friend was intellectually ill equipped to perform himself. In this way Sydney Carton was the jackal to Mr. Stryver's lion. After being awoken by the waiter at 10pm, Sydney Carton made his way to Stryver's apartment where the two engaged in a long night of drinking while Carton poured over case briefs. While Stryver reclined on the sofa and drank at ease, Carton draped himself in cool wet towels and doggedly drank alcoholic punch and did his work. At three in the morning, the work complete, the two friends discuss the differences in the their nature and recall the days they spent as students in Paris. Before Carton leaves, Stryver asks what he thought of the pretty Miss Manette and is surprised to hear his morose friend's assertion that she was not very pretty. Carton walks home alone through the cold streets and falls asleep in his rarely used bed.
Analysis of Chapters 4-5
These chapters serve to flesh out the character of Sydney Carton. His discussion with Darnay demonstrates that although the two are alike in appearance their demeanors are very different. While Darnay eats, Carton drinks and whereas Darnay is polite and tempers his responses, Carton's comments are caustic, fueled by alcohol and a general dissatisfaction with life. The second half of Carton's evening, spent at Mr. Stryver's apartment, illustrates Carton's genius with the law and his complete willingness to let his partner take the credit for his own work. Though, as Mr. Stryver notes, In these descriptions, the reader is given the impression of a man who feels unloved, uninspired and for lack of any other attractive alternative, satisfied with simply doing his partner's work. Their discussion reveals that they have known each other since their school days and that Stryver has always been pushing his way to the front ranks. ""You were always somewhere,"" observes Carton, ""and I was always - nowhere."" They are opposites and together they seem to be prospering. Their partnership is depicted as a friendly union that neither man seems impelled to break. Sydney Carton's dismissal of Miss Manette's beauty, something, which has obviously affected him, reveals that he is not devoid of sensitivity and yearning for a higher purpose.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 6
Four months pass. Mr. Lorry is in the habit of visiting Lucie and Dr. Manette in their pleasant Soho home on Sunday afternoons. Dr. Manette practices medicine from his house and has earned a reputation as a shrewd and vigilant scientist. On an exceptionally fine Sunday Mr. Lorry arrives at the Manette residence and is told that Dr. and Miss Manette are out but will return shortly. Mr. Lorry goes upstairs to wait. He notices that Dr. Manette's old shoe making tools sit unused in the Doctor's bedroom. Miss Pross enters and they engage in a sharp but friendly conversation about the people who come to visit Lucie. Miss Pross is afraid that Lucie's affections will be taken from her and she asserts that none of the callers are as good for her as Miss Pross' estranged brother, Solomon, whom Mr. Lorry knows to be a dishonest scoundrel. Mr. Lorry questions Miss Pross about Dr. Manette's health and asks why he has not disposed of the shoemaking bench and tools. Miss Pross posits the theory that the Doctor is afraid of losing his mind again. She observes that the doctor shies away from any discussion of his imprisonment. She confides that sometimes the doctor paces the floor in the night and Lucie walks with him until he is composed. At that moment the house, which is so situated on street that any footsteps in the street echo loudly within, begins to resound with the approach of Lucie and Doctor Manette. The group has a pleasant dinner and then, owing to the heat of the evening, they sit under the plane tree and drink wine. Mr. Darnay joins them and in the course of conversation tells them of a story he heard regarding some buried scraps of paper found in the Tower (prison) that had been interred long ago by an inmate but were deteriorated and could not be deciphered. Doctor Manette is visibly upset by the story but claims that his consternation is result of the rain that has begun to fall. The group goes inside for tea where Mr. Carton joins them. The drops of rain continue to fall with greater frequency and as they listen to the echoes of unseen people's footsteps rushing in the street Lucie remarks on her fancy that when she listens to the footsteps she imagines that they represent the hundreds of people who will enter their lives. A great thunderstorm breaks and it is one o'clock in the morning before it has cleared sufficiently for Mr. Lorry to walk home with Jerry as an escort.
Analysis of Chapter 6
This chapter establishes the close knit-ties among the Manettes, Charles Darnay, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry. Mr. Lorry is accepted as a surrogate uncle and Miss Pross, though she affects to be in their service, is very much part of the ""family"". Sydney Carton's presence indicates that he also feels comfortable paying the Manette's a visit but his aloof and morose demeanor, while accepted among the group, establishes emotional distance between him and the others. Charles Darnay's story about the discovered manuscript obviously upsets the doctor and foreshadows the discovery of a different manuscript that the doctor has either forgotten or is trying to forget at the time. Lucie's interpretation of the echoing footsteps also serves to foreshadow the footsteps of the Paris mob that will soon enter all their lives.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 7-9
In Paris, Monseigneur (who is identified only as one of the upper echelons of the French royal court's aristocracy) is holding one of his regular receptions at his Grand Hotel. The Monseigneur is in his private chamber with the four men required to properly serve him his chocolate. The narrator describes the opulence of Monseigneur's lifestyle, filled with parties and theater, and sums up the nobles' idea of public business as ""let everything go on its own way"" and most especially to let it go his, the Monseigneur's, own way. We are told that, lacking aptitude for managing finances and in danger of growing poor, the Monseigneur took his sister out of a convent and married her to a rich Farmer-General who desired the status associated with the Monseigneur's royal name. Waiting in the main rooms is the usual assemblage of well-connected people who the narrator characterizes as being useless in their avowed specialties. Everyone is wonderfully and richly dressed. Eventually Monseigneur condescends to move among his guests and he is much fawned over before he returns to his private chamber. Eventually only one visitor is left, a man of about sixty with fine features, who is not in the Monseigneur's favor and pauses to offer a curse in the direction of the private chamber before leaving.
The man's carriage rushes through the narrow streets without regard to the safety of the peasants who flee to avoid its wheels. There is a jolt and a cry and the horses rear and stop. The passenger, who is recognized by the newly formed crowd as Monsieur the Marquis, discovers that his carriage has run over a small child and the father, is now weeping over the body of his dead son. The Marquis admonishes the people to keep out of the way of carriages, suggests that his horses might have been injured and throws a gold coin to the moaning father. Another man arrives and calls the bereaved father by name, Gaspard, and comforts him that life is miserable and his son is best shut of it. The Marquis overhears and asks the man's name that he learns is Defarge. The Marquis throws Defarge a gold coin as well but as he is being driven away he is shocked when someone throws a gold coin into his carriage. He stops and angrily yells at the crowd but sees only a stout woman with her knitting where Defarge had been. The Marquis rides on and is followed by other carriages from the fancy ball. The narrator compares the watching peasants to rats who must return to their holes.
The Monsieur the Marquis' carriage is making its way slowly up a country hill on its way to his chateau. The countryside is full of sparse, underdeveloped fields. Eventually the carriage reaches the small village near the Marquis' home. The people of the village are downtrodden, hungry and burdened with heavy taxes. A prison looks down upon the village from a nearby crag. The Marquis questions a man who he saw looking at his carriage as it came up the hill and learns, to his anger, that a man covered in white dust who is stranger in the region had been suspended under his carriage. The Marquis continues to his mansion and is stopped en route by a poor woman who has just buried her husband who died from want. She begs for a small stone engraved with her husband's name to mark his grave but the Marquis ignores her petition and drives on. When he arrives at his chateau he learns that his nephew, Monsieur Charles from England, has not yet arrived.
The chateau is made of stone and its walls contain numerous carvings of flowers, men and animals. The Marquis makes his way through the richly furnished chateau to his private chambers where settings for two diners have been laid. Halfway through his supper the Marquis' nephew arrives from England. The Marquis' nephew is Charles Darnay. The two men have a conversation during the course of which is becomes apparent that Charles, attempting to gratify the last wish of his dead mother, has refuted his aristocratic family and rejected all that it stands for. He accuses his uncle of committing great wrongs against the people with the aid of his dead father, who was the Marquis' twin brother. Charles also asserts that the Marquis, if he were not currently in disfavor at the Court, would have had him imprisoned long ago. The Marquis seems amused by Charles' accusations and does not deny them. Rather, he seems proud of his station and the acrimony of the French peasants. ""Detestation of the high,"" he tells his nephew, ""is the involuntary homage of the low."" Charles again asserts that wants nothing to do with the family name and states that if the family wealth ever came to him he would find ways to disperse it among the poor. To Charles' dismay his uncle knowingly questions Charles about Doctor Manette and Lucie. Soon thereafter Charles retires and the Marquis sleeps as well. Three hours later the sun rises and the people of the village begin their day. The grizzled mender of roads, however, senses some inordinate bustle at the chateau and returns to the village fountain where he learns that the body of the Marquis has been discovered with a knife driven into its chest through a note that reads: ""Drive him fast to his tomb. This from JACQUES.""
Analysis of Chapters 7-9
The scenes in the Monseignuer's court serve to highlight the ostentatious wealth of the French aristocracy and its lack of concern for the peasantry. Dickens thoroughly researched this period of French history in preparing his book and many of the details, the number of servers required to serve the chocolate for instance, are accurate. It was not rare for carriages to run over people in the street and only a fine punished nobles if their carriage inadvertently killed a man. The Marquis' obvious inhumanity and failure to appreciate the latent power of the mob serves as a reminder that a lifetime of privilege carries with it a dangerous and destructive egoism. Appropriately, the Marquis' chateau is made entirely of stone and is decorated with stone visages that, like his station in life, both shield him and complement his own intractable world-view. This section also reveals that Charles Darnay, whose real family name is Evremonde, is the nephew of this horrible man. Though he has sworn off all ties with the family it is obvious from his uncle's allusion to Doctor and Miss Manette that there is more to the family's unsavory history that will directly involve Charles though he has moved to England and begun a new life. Though the Marquis believes that he will witness this event his life is taken suddenly by an assassin, assumed to be the stranger riding under the Marquis' carriage. The reference to ""Jacques"" in the note and the exhortation to drive the Maquis ""fast to his tomb"" indicates to the reader that Gaspard, the joker of the Saint Antoine district in Paris, has murdered the Marquis to avenge the death of his son.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 10-14
It is one year later and Charles Darnay has established himself as a higher teacher of the French language. He works hard and prospers from his diligence. One summer day he visits Dr. Manette with the intention of asking for Lucie's hand in marriage. The doctor has become an energetic and productive man and enthusiastically greets his friend. Dr. Manette grows serious when Darnay broaches the subject of marriage but encourages him to continue. Charles assures the doctor that he has no intention of separating him from his daughter and expresses his hope that the marriage would only bind father and daughter closer. The doctor agrees with these sentiments but when Darnay begins to speak of his past, admitting that his family name is not Darnay, the Doctor grows apprehensive and begs him to stop. He asks Charles to reveal his identity only if Lucie agrees to marry him and then not until the morning of the wedding. Darnay readily agrees. That evening Lucie returns to find her father working at his old prison occupation of shoemaking. She is distraught but when she calls to him he walks with her until he falls asleep.
It is 5 o'clock the next morning and Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton are awake and still drinking following another night of work. Stryver very haughtily announces that he intends to ask for Lucie Manette's hand in marriage even though the pairing will bring him no financial gain. He accuses Carton of being a disagreeable fellow and asserts that he has been embarrassed by his friend's sullen moody behavior during their visits to the Manette's. Stryver goes on to express his belief that Miss Manette will benefit greatly from the marriage and that his proposal will be a piece of good fortune for her. Carton drinks heavily during Stryver's speech and offers no resistance to the proposal though his shrewd caustic responses belie a deeper emotional struggle than his manner suggests. Stryver finishes his speech by recommending that his friend marry a woman with money so as to provide for his otherwise dismal future.
Mr. Stryver has no doubt that his proposal to Lucie will be successful. He resolves to ask for her hand immediately in order that they may begin preparations for the wedding. On his way to the Manette's he stops at Tellson's to share the good news with Mr. Lorry. The banker receives the news coldly and, much to Mr. Stryver's dismay offers no encouragement. In fact, his first response is ""Oh dear me!"" Although Mr. Lorry agrees with Mr. Stryver's various claims to worthiness he persists in withholding his approval. In his arrogance, Stryver is unable to discern any logical reason why Lucie would refuse to marry him. He asks Mr. Lorry if he thinks that Miss Manette is a fool. Mr. Lorry bristles at the implied offense to Miss Manette and suggests that in order to avoid painful, embarrassing situations for Doctor and Miss Manette; he should go to Soho that evening instead of Mr. Stryver to confer with the Doctor on the matter. He promises to bring an answer to Mr. Stryver immediately after his interview. Though Stryver can see no reason for the intermediary he accepts Mr. Lorry's offer. After Mr. Stryver leaves Tellson's, however, he considers the situation and realizes that Mr. Lorry would not express doubts if he did not believe them to be true. By the time the banker calls at his apartment to tell him the suit would not prosper, Mr. Stryver has already reconfigured the situation in his mind so that it is Miss Manette who has tried to seduce him in order to better herself and failed in the attempt. He even asserts that he might not have proposed in the first place. Mr. Lorry is dumbfounded and finds himself bustled out before he can formulate a response.
It was true that Sydney Carton was always moody and morose when at the Manette's. Yet, many nights he would walk in their neighborhood for hours until the sun rose. Soon after Mr. Stryver tells him that he has reconsidered asking for Lucie's hand, Sydney Carton is seized by a sudden impulse and goes to the Manette house where he finds Lucie alone at her work. In very sorrowful terms he expresses to her his belief that his life will only get progressively worse and that if for a moment he could have believed that she loved him he would have known that he would only bring her misery. She implores him to believe that he can prosper and be happy and asks if without her love there is no other way that she can make him happy. He asserts that he is beyond redemption but that she has stirred something in him that he thought long since dead. Again, she asks if she can do anything for him and Carton answers that he would like her to remember that on this occasion he opened himself to her and that there was enough left of him that was worthy of pity. She sorrowfully agrees to keep his trust and he humbly thanks her. On his way out he tells her that he will never speak of their conversation again and will deny that it ever occurred should she broach the subject. She weeps at his display of emotion and he reminds her that in a couple of hours he will be so besotted as to not be worthy of such affection. Carton tells her that in the near future, when the ties of marriage and motherhood have enclosed her, to remember there is one such as himself who would give his life for her happiness. He departs.
Jerry Cruncher and his son are in their regular spot outside of Tellson's watching the constant flow of traffic moving up and down Fleet Street. They see a funeral procession approaching and Jerry notices that the crowd is jeering and calling out that the man to be buried was a spy and that his body should be tumbled out of the casket. Jerry learns that the man's name was Roger Cly and that he was an Old Bailey informant. The crowd resolves to pull the body from the coach but someone in the crowd suggest instead accompanying the coach to its graveyard destination and the mob readily agrees. Jerry Cruncher slips into the crowd and accompanies them to the burial ground. After the casket is buried the mob goes on to dissolve into random acts of vandalism and drunkenness. Jerry Cruncher calmly smokes a pipe and makes a close survey of the low gates in the graveyard where the casket has been interred. That evening, amidst continuous appeals to his wife not to pray, he announces that he will be out on one of his nocturnal fishing trips that night. When his son asks about the rust on his hands and wonders aloud whether his father will return with any fish, his father sharply silences him. At one o'clock in the morning Jerry fetches some heavy tools from a locked cabinet and, believing the rest of the family to be asleep, exits the house. Young Jerry follows him and observes that two other men join his father before they reach a graveyard. Jerry the younger is horrified to observe that his father and his friends begin unearthing a fresh grave and though he initially flees in terror he returns to watch. Once the casket is unearthed, however, he flees home and falls into a troubled sleep. The next morning he knows that something must have gone wrong with the operation because his father is very upset and accuses his wife of praying against him. On the way to Tellson's young Jerry asks his father the meaning of the profession ""Resurrection Man"" and when his father haltingly tells him that it is a person who provides cadavers to doctors young Jerry announces that he would like to grow up to be a resurrection man. Jerry is noticeably proud of his son.
Analysis of Chapters 10-14
This section serves to broaden the reader's understanding of several of the key characters and their relationships toward one another. Of Lucie's three potential suitors only Carton speaks directly to Lucie. Darnay takes the admirable course by consulting with the doctor beforehand and as this is the proper method, and the affection between him and Miss Manette is apparent, it is assumed that his suit will prosper. Mr. Stryver's proposal, on the other hand, is presumed to fail by everyone who knows of it except Stryver himself. That his pride can admit no other explanation save Lucie's own ignorance and stupidity underscores his egotistic sensibility. Two events occur which create suspense and foreshadow things to come. First, Doctor Manette is apprehensive about Darnay's past and his insistence on postponing the truth coupled with his temporary relapse leads the reader to draw a connection between the Evr�monde's and the doctor's imprisonment. Second, Sydney Carton's emotional episode with Lucie Manette reveals him to be a man of much greater sensibility and feeling than previously depicted. His avowal to give his life for her happiness introduces a defining aspect of his character and one that will figure prominently later in both their lives. The episode with Jerry Cruncher and his son reveals the reason behind Jerry Cruncher's muddy boots and rusty hands. Though his nocturnal occupation provides extra income it is apparent that he feels some doubt regarding its morality. He not only castigates his wife for praying but he is happy to learn that his son does not condemn the practice.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 15-16
For three days in a row there has been more than the usual number of early drinkers in the Defarge's wine shop. Monsieur Defarge has been absent for several days but Madame Defarge tends to her customers, many of whom come not to drink but to whisper conspiracies. When known spies for the government enter the conversation ceases and Madame Defarge knits steadily. At noon on the third day Monsieur Defarge enters the shop with the mender of roads from the small village where the Marquis was murdered. All the men refer to each other as ""JACQUES."" While the mender of roads takes a thin meal of stale bread and wine, various men get up and leave the shop to go to the garret apartment. Eventually Defarge and the road mender join the others. The road mender says that a man the Parisians know to be Gaspard, father of the child run over by the Marquis' carriage, was captured by the soldiers of his village. He was beaten and placed in a cage suspended above the prison and for many days the people in the town witnessed his suffering but could do nothing to help him. The villagers heard that a petition had been presented to the King to spare the man's life but they didn't know if it was true. Two of the Jacques interrupt the story and explain to the road mender that Defarge himself hazarded his own life by stepping in front of the King's carriage and was beaten for presenting the petition. The mender of roads says that the people of the village whispered that in Paris prisoners were horribly tortured before being killed and another of the Jacques affirms this fact. One morning the village awoke to find a gallows erected next to their communal fountain. That afternoon Gaspard was hung and his body left to rot with the murder weapon decorating the gallows. His story finished, the road mender is asked to wait outside while Defarge and the various Jacques confer. They all agree to include the Marquis' entire family and his chateau on their list of those registered for destruction. Defarge assures the men that the authorities will not discover his wife's method of keeping the list, sewn as code into her knitting. Before the road mender returns to his village the Defarge's take him to see a royal procession. The road mender is overcome by the gallantry and reach pageantry of the aristocracy that he cries out his enthusiasm. Later the Defarges commend his zeal and remind him that it will be useful when the time comes to destroy the aristocracy. The road mender returns to his village wiser and for the first time in his simple life, empowered.
The Defarge's return to the wine shop and Monsieur Defarge learns from a Jacques of the police that a new spy named John Barsad has started working the Saint Antoine district. As she shuts up the shop for the night Madame Defarge observes that her husband is depressed and he admits that he is sad that the revolution may not come in his lifetime. She reminds him that it could come at any moment and though it may not arrive while they live she is confident they have done much to help bring it to fruition. The next day a man Madame Defarge recognizes as the spy John Barsad comes into the shop and tries to bait her into revealing the district's sympathies for the executed Gaspard. As a signal to the others in the shop she places a flower in her hair and the shop quickly empties. As Barsad tries to bait her, Madame Defarge knits his name into the register. Monsieur Defarge joins them and the spy, knowing that Doctor Manette sheltered with the Defarge's, relates the news that Miss Manette is to marry the nephew of the murdered Marquis who is living under the name Darnay in England. Madame records this information in her register as well. After the spy leaves, Monsieur Defarge expresses his hope that destiny will keep Darnay out of France but his wife observes that fate will do what it will. That evening Monsieur Defarge admires the character of his wife as she goes throughout the street visiting the women.
Analysis of Chapters 15-16
These chapters juxtapose the horrible death of Gaspard with the increasing unrest in Paris. Significantly, the mender of roads from the village is the one to convey the news of Gaspard's death and his horror at effect upon his fellow villagers connects with the sentiments already being pursued by the society of Jacques in Saint Antoine. The manner in which the Defarge's use his zeal for the pageantry of the procession to remind him that such zeal can be turned to his own advantage encapsulates the manner in which the methodical planning of the Jacques and their agenda can be readily accepted by the rural peasants who have suffered as much under the wasteful aristocratic rule. Madame Defarge emerges from this section as a prime motivator for the revolution. She is differentiated from her husband in two ways. First, she is shown to be more patient and determined when she demonstrates to him that it is only necessary that their enemies suffer not that they do the actual persecution. Second, she does not express any sympathy for Charles Darnay whom she considers a member of the aristocracy and therefore irredeemable in her eyes.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 17-20
The night before Lucie Manette is to marry Charles Darnay she and her father sit under the plane tree in their yard and she reassures him that he love for Charles and all the ties that marriage will bring will not intrude upon her feelings for her father. He assures her that he knows this to be true and that her marriage will only make him happier. He speaks of the time he spent in prison, something Lucie has only heard him mention once before, and describes how he imagined what his child might be, son or daughter, and worried that they would never know him. He explains that in his furthest flights of solitary imagining he never would have believed that he could be as happy as his present life has made him. Later that night Lucie sneaks into her father's bedroom and, placing her hand on his breast, she prays that she will always be true to him.
The morning of the wedding Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross fuss over the beautiful bride while Dr. Manette and Charles Darnay confer in the adjoining room. When Mr. Lorry suggests that he should have married before he grew old, Miss Pross insists that he was born to be a bachelor. Mr. Lorry promises Lucie that he and Miss Pross will take good care of her father while she and Charles spend two weeks honeymooning in Warwickshire and will send him to Wales to join them in good health. When Darnay and the Doctor emerge from their conference Mr. Lorry notices that the Doctor is pale and seems cowed. The wedding, which is private at a small church, goes smoothly and after breakfast the newly married couple are on their way. Mr. Lorry again notices the doctor's changed demeanor and when he returns later in the evening he is alarmed to find Doctor Manette at his old occupation of making shoes. The doctor does not recognize either Mr. Lorry or Miss Pross. Mr. Lorry, for the first time in his life, takes a leave of absence from Tellson's in order to attend to his sick friend. For nine days he tries to bring the doctor to his senses by making small talk about ordinary affairs.
On the morning of the tenth day Mr. Lorry awakes in the doctor's room where he had unintentionally fallen asleep. The doctor has returned to normal but is not aware that nine days have passed since Lucie's wedding. After breakfast Mr. Lorry engages his friend in a discussion regarding a hypothetical friend who recently experienced the recurrence of an old mental debility. The doctor understands that they are in fact discussing himself but continues with the conceit. When the doctor learns that Mr. Lorry's ""friend's"" daughter is unaware of the relapse he is very thankful. The doctor admits that the relapse was foreseen by its subject and dreaded. The doctor expresses his belief that the relapse might not return. Mr. Lorry asks if perhaps if his friend works too hard and the doctor denies that this is the cause. Mr. Lorry then suggests that the tools that accompany the relapse (meaning the shoemaker's tools and bench) should be thrown away. The doctor argues that they were once so important to the subject's survival as to have become dear to him. He relents, however, that they should be disposed of in the subject's absence. Accordingly, as soon as the doctor has left for Wales to meet his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. Lorry with Miss Pross assisting utterly destroys the shoemaking implements.
Soon after Charles and Lucie return their first visitor is Sydney Carton. He pulls Charles aside and asks him if they could be friends so he might have the privilege of calling upon the couple informally about four times a year. Charles asserts that they have always been friends, which Carton dismisses, but readily accepts Charles' offer to call upon them whenever he feels the need. Later that night Charles makes comments about Carton being reckless and careless. Later, in private, Lucie begs him to show more leniency in his opinion of Carton and expresses her belief that he is capable of great things. Charles is touched by the reminder that while they are happy Carton is miserable. He promises to remember her advice.
Analysis of Chapters 17-20
The doctor's mental relapse following his private conversation with Charles Darnay sets the stage for a collision between the doctor's past and Charles' aristocratic family. Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross are revealed are shown to have softened in the years of they have spent with the Manette family. Their easy banter and shared joy in the union reflect a deeper emotional life than either had been comfortable expressing at the beginning of the story. As such, it is appropriate that they share in the destruction of the doctor's shoemaking tools - the most tangible sign of his former life and in their view the best service they can do for the family. Their sensitivity to the dynamics of the family, evidenced by the secrecy they maintain around the doctor's relapse, endears them to Dr. Manette when he has recovered his senses. This desire to protect his daughter from his relapses coupled with his tacit permission to destroy the shoemaking implements indicates that Doctor Manette is hopeful of overcoming his past and its associations with Darnay's ancestry. Sydney Carton's somewhat awkward request to be permitted to visit the family demonstrates the degree to which their happiness has become necessary for his survival. That Lucie's sympathy for him is genuine is evidenced by her defense of his character to her husband.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 21-24
Years pass. Lucie occasionally suffers misgivings about the future but she is a model mother and homemaker. She gives birth to a daughter, which she and Charles name Lucie. Later they have a son who dies while still a child. They see Sydney Carton about six times a year but he is never intoxicated when he visits. Little Lucie forms an emotional attachment to Carton and, without knowing why, pities him. Stryver achieves professional success with Carton's help and marries a wealthy widow with three sons. When Stryver presents these boys as pupils to Darnay they are rejected. About the time of little Lucie's sixth birthday, Mr. Lorry arrives with grave news of social unrest in France from Tellson's Paris branch. They all feel powerless against the rising tide of violence.
Far across the water in the district of Saint Antoine, centered upon the Defarge's wine shop, the revolution has begun and the Defarge's are busy arming the peasants and leading them in an assault upon the hated Bastille prison. For many hours the siege continues until the remaining soldiers surrender and the peasantry rush in with bloodthirsty vengeance. Madame Defarge, armed with pistols and a saber, leads the women and Monsieur Defarge is one of the first men to enter the breached prison. Monsieur Defarge has a soldier lead him to one-hundred-and-five north tower, the former cell of Doctor Manette. The soldier leads him though dense passageways to the long uninhabited cell where Defarge and one of the Jacques find the initials A.M. (Alexandre Manette) carved in the wall. They search the cell and Defarge claims to have found nothing in the chimney before they return to the mob. With the Defarge's in the lead, the mob propels the governor of the prison through the streets and when he falls dead from its blows Madame Defarge cuts off his head with her knife. Seven prisoners are released and the heads of seven guards are hoisted up on pikes for display.
A week later the Saint Antoine district is calm but enlivened by its newly discovered power. Madame Defarge has a lieutenant honorably named The Vengeance. Monsieur Defarge returns to the shop with the news that an aristocrat named Foulon, an enemy of the people who told them they should eat grass if they were hungry, is being brought into the city as a prisoner. At the urgings of the Defarge's the district of Saint Antoine is roused to a murderous pitch and the crowd goes to the Hall of Examination where Foulon is being questioned. Eventually the crowd seizes the aged man and hangs him from a lamppost, severs his head from his body and places it, with grass in its mouth, upon a pike for all to see. Then the mob seizes Foulon's son-in-law and treats him to a similar fate. Eventually the crowd returns to Saint Antoine to prepare what meager food is available and share in the companionship of the district.
Far away in the village the mender of roads continues at his occupation. There is a great blight upon the lands and nothing will grow in the dry heat. The soldiers of the prison are reduced in number and their officers have no faith that they will obey orders. Throughout France the aristocracy has begun to flee the country for fear of so many hungry people. All over France, low-caste men from revolutionary Paris have begun to mix with the local populations in the small villages. One day in July, the mender of roads meets a shaggy-haired man coming down the road. They greet one another as ""JACQUES"" and by dropping a pinch of gunpowder into his pipe the stranger indicates that there will be action that night. The stranger sleeps while the mender works and at sunset the stranger proceeds in the direction of the Marquis' chateau. That night the village, much to the consternation of Monsieur Gabelle (the local chief functionary) expectantly gathers near the fountain. In the grounds of the chateau the stranger meets three others who have come from the cardinal points on the compass. Soon their efforts yield a great conflagration that swallows the chateau. A rider from the chateau comes to the village seeking aid but is ignored. The rider gallops to the prison but the officers, looking doubtfully at their soldiers, tell him that the chateau must burn. The villagers light their houses with candles and surround the house of Monsieur Gabelle who resolves to throw himself from the roof if the villagers break in. In other villages the same scene is repeated and the revolution comes to the countryside.
Three years pass and the aristocracy have all been killed or hunted out of France. Many of those aristocrats who live in exile in England gather daily at Tellson's, which due to its branch offices in both countries, has become a conduit of information. One morning Charles Darnay visits Tellson's with the object of dissuading Mr. Lorry from making a scheduled trip to France in order to save what documentation can be spared from the Paris branch. Darnay expresses the wish that he was going himself because, as a Frenchmen with sympathy for the people, he might be of some use. Mr. Lorry assures his friends that the trip is absolutely necessary and tells him that he will depart that night with Jerry Cruncher as an escort. Their conversation takes place amid the hustle and bustle of the bank where various French aristocrats-in-exile are venting their complaints against the people of France. Mr. Styver is also there and much to Darnay's annoyance loudly supports the aristocrat's assertions. Darnay notices that a letter on Mr. Lorry's desk is addressed to Darnay's real name ""The Marquis St. Evr�monde"". When the other exiled aristocrats begin to disparage the missing Evr�monde, Darnay defends him and receives much ridicule from Mr. Stryver. Darnay admits that he knows Evr�monde and Mr. Lorry entrusts him to deliver the letter. Outside, Darnay opens the letter and finds that it is from Gabelle, an old loyal servant of the Marquis, who has been imprisoned and will be killed unless the emigrant (i.e. Darnay) returns to answer charges of treason against the people. Darnay considers that he has committed no crime and resolves to go to Paris. He is beguiled with the belief that by going he can do some good and perhaps help steer the revolution away from its bloody beginning. He gives Mr. Lorry a letter for Gabelle. The following night, before he departs for France, he leaves letters for Lucie and Doctor Manette explaining his reasons for going to Paris.
Analysis of Chapters 21-24
The revolution finally arrives with the storming of the Bastille. Dickens strove to be historically accurate in his depiction of the event, including such incidents as the beheading of the governor and the number of prisoners actually freed, but places his characters in the forefront of the action. Although the subject's name is changed, the incident in which Foulon is killed by the mob and his mouth stuffed with grass actually occurred during the revolution and lends credence to the story for Dickens' readers. Madame Defarge is revealed to be a woman capable of great acts of violence indicating a deep-seated need for revenge previously only gleaned through her methodical knitting. She shows great zeal in beheading the Bastille's Governor and later plays a key role in Foulon's death. When the revolution spreads to the countryside it is the men from the city who must stir the peasants to rebellion but once shown that the old ways can be destroyed they are quick to capitalize on their new sense of power as evidenced by the scene with the functionary Gabelle is persecuted and driven to his rooftop. It is typical of the plot scheme that the letter, which calls Darnay to France, should reach him through his association with Mr. Lorry. The train of events, which stemmed from the Marquis' carriage killing Gaspard's child, has resulted in Gabelle's imprisonment and Darnay's motive for returning to France. His decision to leave is motivated at least in part by pride as displayed by his obvious displeasure at Mr. Stryver's remarks regarding his Evremonde identity and his belief that he can play some part in leading the uprising against his own class.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 1-5
Upon arriving in France, Charles Darnay's progress to Paris is retarded by numerous inspections by each small village's group of red-capped patriots. At one such village, still a far distance from Paris, he is awakened in the middle of the night and is told that as an aristocrat he must be escorted to Paris under guard, that he must leave immediately and that he must pay for the escort. At the small town of Beauvias he is told that new decrees have seized all the property of emigres and aristocrats and that more decrees are expected soon that will condemn all such persons as himself to death. Nevertheless, Darnay and his escort reach Paris the following day where at the Barrier none other than Monsieur Defarge inspects his papers, especially the letter from Gabelle. The officer in charge consigns Darnay, or Evremonde, as he is known in France, to the prison of La Force. On the way to the prison, Defarge relates his connection to Darnay's family but refuses to help him in any way. Darnay hears a crier in the streets announcing that the royal family has been taken to prison and that all foreign ambassadors have fled the country. He then realizes that the situation in his native country is much more serious and deadly than he had previously imagined. The narrator notes that in a few days the mass executions by Guillotine would begin. Although the orders for Darnay's imprisonment call for him to be held ""in secret"" or solitary confinement he briefly mingles with some of the other prisoners and is amazed to find that the prisoners are full of manners and refinement while the guards are uncouth and uncultured. Once in his cell he is told that he may not purchase any writing utensils or paper but may purchase food. Alone he paces his cell and thinks about Doctor Manette making shoes.
The Paris branch of Tellson's is located in a wing of a large house that has been seized from its aristocrat owner. Unlike the London branch, it is lavishly furnished and separated from the street by a high wall. In its courtyard there is a grindstone that the revolutionaries used to sharpen their weapons. After a busy day of trying to reconcile utterly chaotic accounts and take inventory of what documents remain, Mr. Lorry is sitting by the fire, listening to the chaos in the streets and giving thanks that, so he believes, no one dear to him is in the city. Shortly thereafter he is surprised when Lucie and Doctor Manette appear at his door and, in a state of high emotion, inform him that Charles has been in the city several days as a prisoner. They are interrupted by the sound of a large crowd in the courtyard and Mr. Lorry, who knows that it is the sound of weapons being sharpened at the grindstone, begs them not to open the blinds. Doctor Manette explains that his past suffering as a prisoner of the Bastille has made him a hero and person whose character is beyond reproach in the new Republic. Fearing that the sight of the mob might overwhelm Lucie, however, Mr. Lorry sequesters her in another room while he and Doctor Manette look upon the grisly sight of the angry mob savagely sharpening its bloody instruments of death in the yard below. Mr. Lorry informs Doctor Manette that the mob is murdering the prisoners and begs him to use what influence he has immediately to spare Charles' life. Doctor Manette converts the mob to his cause and departs with them to La Force. Mr. Lorry goes to Lucie and finds her with Miss Pross and her daughter. Lucie has collapsed under the emotional strain and Mr. Lorry spends a sleepless night waiting for word from the Doctor.
The next day Mr. Lorry, knowing that he cannot endanger Tellson's by sheltering Lucie and her family and also aware that Charles will not be able to leave the city for some time even if he is released, engages an apartment near the bank for the family and leaves Jerry to look after them. Later in the day, Monsieur Defarge arrives with a note from the doctor to the effect that Charles is saved for the moment but will not be released. In the note the doctor asks that the messenger be permitted to see Lucie. Only after Madame Defarge and The Vengeance join them on the way to the apartment does Mr. Lorry notice Defarge's affected, mechanical manner. At the apartment Lucie is initially grateful for her husband's note and his observation that her father has ""influence"" in Paris. Madame Defarge's cold manner and relentless knitting make Lucie apprehensive. After Madame Defarge has seen little Lucie she leaves. Before she leaves Lucie begs her to help her family and Madame Defarge's impersonal reply brings despair to them all.
Four days later Doctor Manette returns and describes to Mr. Lorry the horror of the hundreds of executions. He relates how he used his influence to stay Charles' execution but could not get him released or his case brought to trial. Over time, Doctor Manette becomes well known and liked among the revolutionaries and practices his trade as the chief surgeon for three prisons including La Force. Mr. Lorry notices that whereas the Doctor's imprisonment was once a source of weakness and fear in revolutionary Paris it has become his strength and solace. He vows to save Charles. Nevertheless, fifteen months pass and Charles remains a prisoner while the Doctor builds his reputation among the bloody horrors of the revolution.
During the long months of Charles' imprisonment Lucie does her best to repress her grief and attend to her father and daughter. One day her father informs her that on some days at 3pm Charles is able to gain access to window that looks down upon a street corner near a woodsawyers shop. Every day afterward she waits from 2pm to 4pm. Over time the woodsawyer, an ardent revolutionary, engages her in conversation. Occasionally she gives him drink money but is fearful of him. The woodsawyer notices that she is constantly looking at the prison but claims, ominously, that it is none of his business. One day while she waits, Lucie is horrified to witness several hundred people including The Vengeance and the woodsawyer doing a demonic dance called the Carmagnole in the street. Later her father joins her and reassures his daughter that he can save Charles who has been summoned before the Tribunal the next day. When Doctor Manette visits Mr. Lorry that evening the narrator comments that Mr. Lorry has a visitor who chooses to remain unknown to the doctor.
Analysis of Chapters 1-5
Dickens is careful about placing Charles Darnay's return to France just prior to the bloody September massacres of that marked the beginning of the Reign of Terror and the mass executions of those condemned as enemies of the people. Darnay's dream of somehow using his influence to help direct the course of the revolution is utterly dashed by the decrees he hears en route to the city and on his way to prison. The wave of murderous, vengeful death begins with the killing of the prisoners. A notable juxtaposition of scenes occurs when Mr. Lorry and Doctor Manette look out from Tellson's, a place of safety and seclusion, to witness the bloody mob sharpening its instruments of death. At this moment, however, Doctor Manette is pressed to use his influence and he immediately succeeds in winning over the mob. This early success emboldens the doctor and whose past suffering becomes a source of strength in revolutionary Paris. While he works among the horrors of the revolution, becoming well known and well liked in the process, he grows more confident of his ability to save Charles and at no point does he express doubts that he will succeed. He is even able to arrange that Charles should be able to see Lucie occasionally during her corner-side vigils. The woodsawyers keen interest in Lucie's loitering and the appearance of the Carmagnole in the street remind the reader that the family is surrounded by danger in a city where a show of sympathy for a prisoner could lead to death.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 6-11
Charles Darnay is called to appear before the dreaded Tribunal of five judges. On the day that he appears all fifteen prisoners who go before him are sentenced to death. He notices that Madame and Monsieur Defarge are in the audience but they do not look at him. Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry are also in attendance. Following Dr. Manette's instructions, Charles carefully answers all the Tribunal's accusations and offers as witnesses to his good character the author of the letter, Gabelle, as well as Doctor Manette. The attending crowd, initially bent on taking Charles' life, are converted to his cause following Manette's testimony and Charles is declared free. The crowd is overjoyed and carries the somewhat stunned Darnay to his family's apartment where Lucie collapses in her husband's arms. Lucie and Charles offer thanks to the Doctor who admonishes his daughter not to tremble for fear because he has saved him and now he is safe.
Doctor Manette is a changed man now that he has saved his son-in-law from execution. He is confident and assured. The next afternoon before Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher leave to run errands, Miss Pross announces her fidelity to the English king and asks if they will be returning to England soon. Doctor Manette responds that it would be dangerous for Charles to try and leave so soon after his acquittal. Disappointed but resolute, Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher leave to visit many shops to make small purchases so that the household will not be perceived as ostentatious. While they are gone four men in red caps arrive to re-arrest ""The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay."" When the Doctor demands to know the reason he is told that his son-in-law has been denounced by the Defarge's and one other of the Saint Antoine district to be named the next day at the trial.
Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher enter a wine shop and while their amount is being measured Miss Pross recognizes one of the departing customers as her long-lost brother Solomon and she screams aloud in surprise. Mr. Cruncher is also very surprised and looks at the man as if he has seen a ghost. Solomon rudely beseeches his sister to keep her mouth shut unless she wants to see him killed and the trio retires to the street where he bluntly asks what she wants with him. Miss Pross is stunned by her brother's rude behavior. He admits that he knew she was in the city and has been avoiding her. He is afraid she will give away his true identity to the bloodthirsty revolutionaries with whom he serves as a prison official. Miss Pross begs only a kind word from her brother before he departs but Jerry Cruncher asks the man what other names he has used. As Cruncher struggles to remember the man's alias, Sydney Carton steps up and announces that Solomon is none other than John Barsad, spy and witness at Charles Darnay's first trial in England many years ago. Carton explains that he arrived the previous evening and presented himself to Mr. Lorry but that he chose for his presence to remain unknown until he could be useful. Much to John Barsad's consternation he further explains that Miss Pross' brother is a ""sheep"", or spy, under the goalers at the prison. Carton compels Barsad to accompany him to Tellson's bank where he relates to Mr. Lorry that Charles Darnay has been rearrested. Using the analogy of a card game, Sydney Carton proceeds to explain why it is in Barsad's best interest, lest his identity be betrayed, to be Carton's friend and help him with a special favor. Over the course of the conversation Carton alludes to Barsad's prior co-conspirator, Roger Cly who he believes is in France as well, but Barsad insists that Cly is dead and offers to produce a death certificate as proof. Upon hearing this claim Jerry Cruncher interrupts and, much to the surprise of all present, angrily states that he knows for a fact that Roger Cly's body was not in the coffin that was buried. Barsad is compelled by fear of discovery to assist Carton who, after he learns that Barsad can gain access to the prisoners (though he cannot free anyone), pours himself a third glass of brandy and then asks to speak to the spy in private.
While Carton and Barsad converse, Mr. Lorry demands that the visibly disturbed Jerry Cruncher tell him what else he's been doing for income besides acting as messenger at Tellson's. Cruncher initially answers ""Agricultooral character"" but when Mr. Lorry hints that he will lose his job Cruncher beseeches his employer to go easy on him since many doctors have performed the same function as himself but for higher wages. Seeing that this has not mollified Mr. Lorry, Cruncher begs him to let his son continue at Tellson's while he takes up the more honest profession of grave digging. He claims that the bloody sights of the revolution have caused him to reconsider his nocturnal profession and points out that he need not have volunteered the helpful information regarding Roger Cly. Mr. Lorry agrees to stay Cruncher's friend if he repents in action not just word. Soon afterward, Barsad leaves and Carton announces that he has ensured access to Darnay at least one time prior to his execution. Mr. Lorry is visibly distressed and saddened and Carton expresses feelings of tenderness for the old man that causes Mr. Lorry to re-evaluate the morose barrister. Mr. Lorry is to go visit Lucie that evening and Carton stresses the importance of keeping his presence in Paris a secret from her. Mr. Lorry affirms that he is ready to leave the city and his papers are in order. Carton reminds Mr. Lorry that though the old man is a bachelor he has the great comfort of knowing that if he were to die the next day there would be mourners at his funeral. He and Carton discuss the manner in which a man's memory returns to his childhood as he draws nearer to death and Carton admits that he has recently experienced powerful memories of his unhappy youth. Carton walks Mr. Lorry to the Manettes and then wanders the streets of Paris, retracing in part Lucie's daily walk to the prison. He stops at a chemist's shop and orders several concoctions, which the chemist cautions him against mixing improperly. As he walks that night he repeats to himself the words on his father's gravestone: ""I am the resurrection and the life."" The next morning he slips unnoticed into the courtroom where Charles is to be retried. The prosecution announces three witnesses, Monsieur and Madame Defarge and, amid great uproar, Doctor Manette himself. The doctor protests vociferously but is shouted down and told to listen to the evidence. Monsieur Defarge reads aloud a manuscript he recovered from the doctor's old cell the day that the Bastille fell.
The manuscript is in the doctor's hand was written after he had been a prisoner for ten years. It relates the incidents of his capture and detainment. One night in 1757 he was walking home from a case, a young surgeon with a growing reputation, when a carriage containing two twin gentlemen stopped him and under threats of violence took him to a house where a woman lay restrained on a bed. She was hysterical and kept repeating the phrase ""My husband, my father, and my brother!"" She then would count from one to twelve and say ""Hush"" before repeating the lines again. The two brothers seemed inconvenienced by the woman's condition and after the doctor gave her a sedative, which does not cease her litany, the brothers reluctantly admitted that there was another patient. In a back room filled with hay, the doctor found a young man dying of a saber wound. The brothers showed no pity for this boy whom they referred to as a ""brute."" As he died, the boy told the doctor how his sister, who lies in the other room, married a poor man like herself and when he would not consent to allowing one of the brothers to have his way with her the nobleman harnessed her husband to a cart and drove him like an animal until he died one day at noon, sobbing once for each stroke of the bell. The noble took the girl and when the boy told his father the old man's heart burst from grief and he died. The young man then came to kill the nobleman and free his sister but was outmatched and suffered the mortal wound that he soon died from. The noble who took the girl was none other than the Marquis Evr�monde. The girl lingered a week in great pain and the brothers only concern during this time was that the whole situation seemed ridiculous and potentially degrading to their family. When she finally died the nobles offered the doctor money and insisted on his discretion. He refused, however, to take their gold. The next morning the doctor found the gold on his front doorstep and wrote a letter to his Minister describing the whole situation. The next day, before sending the letter, he was visited by the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde who had heard of the girl's mistreatment and was greatly distressed. She expressed her hope that the girl's younger sister would have a good life. The Doctor saw that the woman had a young son (who is Charles) with her and she shared her belief that in the future her son would have to pay for the wickedness of his father and uncle. The doctor delivered the letter that very day. That night he was summoned by a carriage for an urgent case but soon thereafter the carriage stopped and the brothers stepped from the roadside shadows, burnt the letter in front of the doctor and interred him in the prison where he has remained ever since without communication to the outside world. The Doctor's manuscript ends with a curse upon the Evremonde's and all their descendents. After the reading the crowd and the jury are unanimous in their condemnation of the Evremondes and sentence Charles to be executed the following day.
Lucie and Charles are allowed to briefly embrace. Charles comforts the distraught doctor with the thought that he has done everything in his power but that none can stop fate. Only after hearing the manuscript does the family understand the true nature of the doctor's years of torment. The doomed man is carried back to his cell and Lucie collapses at her father's feet. The doctor utters a great cry of anguish. Sydney Carton appears and carries the unconscious Lucie to a carriage and then into the Manette's apartment where he gently lays her on a couch. Little Lucie hugs Carton and begs him to do something to help them. Carton kisses the still insensible Lucie on the cheek and only little Lucie hears him whisper ""A life you love."" Carton immediately becomes business-like and brings the distraught doctor to his senses. Though he admits to Mr. Lorry that he has no hope of success, Carton charges the doctor with the task of working to spare Charles' life and then to report the result at Mr. Lorry's quarters that evening at 9 o'clock.
Analysis of Chapters 6-11
A great deal happens in this section to move the plot forward and reveal some the stories lingering mysteries. Like Doctor Manette, who is able to use his influence to free his son-in-law, Sydney Carton becomes a changed man in revolutionary Paris. Both men seem at their best when those they love are threatened. Like his friend Stryver, Carton is suddenly energetic and cunning as when he convinces Barsad to help him and, as in his conversation with Mr. Lorry, surprisingly open and sympathetic. His maneuverings and calculated steps (as when he visits the chemist) belie a greater scheme. The doctor's letter reveals, for the first time, the circumstances surrounding his imprisonment and explain the reason for his request that Darnay keep his true identity and secret and the relapse that followed that confession. The audience is reminded of the aristocrat's cruelty during the years leading up to the revolution by the letter. Ironically, it's author's term of imprisonment, recently made a source of strength, becomes the means for his son-in-law's sentence of death. In this way Fate, as personified by Madame Defarge, achieves mastery over the Evremonde clan and the dying boy's request is honored by the doctor himself.",A Tale of Two Cities

Chapter 12-15
With several hours to spare, Carton goes to the Defarge's wine shop with the purpose of making his face known to the revolutionaries. At the shop, he pretends to be unfamiliar with the French language and Madame Defarge closely examines his appearance. He overhears the Defarge's commenting on his likeness to Darnay and also overhears Monsieur Defarge meekly suggest to his wife that Lucie and her daughter's life should be spared in order to please the doctor who has suffered much in the cause of the revolution. Madame Defarge and her compatriots scoff at the idea and Madame reminds her husband that she is the younger daughter of the girl who died so horribly in the doctor's manuscript. Madame Defarge is without mercy and has sworn to wipe out the Evremonde race in its entirety. Carton returns to Mr. Lorry's apartment and waits for the doctor. When Doctor Manette returns soon after midnight it is not only apparent that Charles is doomed but that the Doctor's senses have become deranged. The doctor pitifully begs for his shoemaking tools. Before Mr. Lorry leaves to take the doctor to Lucie, Carton demands that the banker follow his instructions exactly. Mr. Lorry is to hold on to Carton's letters of transit and is to hold the similar papers of the doctor, Lucie and her daughter. He tells Mr. Lorry that Lucie and little Lucie are in grave danger and it is imperative that the family flees the city the next day before the transit papers can be rescinded. Mr. Lorry is to be ready to leave with the family at exactly 2pm the next day but he is not to depart until Carton has rejoined them after visiting Charles in his cell. That night Carton walks outside of Lucie's apartment for the last time.
That same night in prison Charles Darnay composes his mind and resolves himself to accept the death that certainly awaits him. He writes letters to Lucie, Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry but never once thinks of Carton. Eventually he falls into an uneasy sleep and dreams of the happiness of their Soho home. He awakes and knows instantly that on that day, a day marked for 52 executions, he will die. As a church bell tolls the hours he counts each one that he will never see again until it tolls one o'clock and he hears footsteps approaching his cell. Sydney Carton enters and with quick dialogue and forceful appeals he convinces Darnay to change clothing with him one article at a time. Darnay believes that Carton wants to break him out of jail and knowing this to be impossible begs him not to perish in the attempt. Carton denies this plan and orders Darnay to begin writing as he dictates. As Darnay writes Carton prepares a chemical mixture and then forcibly applies it to Darnay, rendering the latter unconscious. Although Barsad fears that Carton will betray himself before the Guillotine falls, and endanger the spy as well, he yields to Carton's assurances and takes the still comatose Darnay out in his place. At two o'clock Carton is taken to a room where the other fifty-two victims wait. A young girl, a seamstress who knew Darnay from his prior imprisonment, approaches Carton, and after some dialogue in which she expresses her fears of death she realizes it is a different man. He motions for her to keep his secret and she implores him ""O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"" He promises to do so until the last. The narrator looks forward in time and observes that the carriage bearing the still unconscious Darnay, his family and Mr. Lorry proceeds safely from the city and slowly but surely makes its way to the coast.
At the same time that Sydney Carton is awaiting execution in Darnay's place, Madame Defarge, the Vengeance and Jacques Three (the most bloodthirsty of the Jacques) hold a meeting in the woodsawyer's shed. Madame Defarge expresses her sadness that her husband lacks the resolve to see the Evremonde clan completely exterminated and she asserts that she must ensure that Evremonde's wife and daughter do not escape the Guillotine. Furthermore, Madame Defarge asserts that the doctor must also fall before the blade. To her compatriot's joy, Madame Defarge announces that she will go to the doctor's apartment and confront Lucie. She agrees to meet the others at the execution site before the blade falls. She carries with her a loaded pistol and a dagger. At the apartment Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher are waiting to leave in a lighter carriage that will overtake and join the one that recently departed containing the family. They know that Carton has traded places with Darnay and that every moment counts. Jerry is so emotional that he proclaims to Miss Pross that he will never do ""It"" any more, (by which he means unearthing dead bodies) and that he will never again forbid Mrs. Cruncher from ""flopping."" Miss Pross understands neither of these allusions but passionately signifies that she has heard him. Miss Pross expresses her belief that it would be best if the second carriage did not depart from the apartment and raise suspicions. She sends Jerry to intercept their carriage and await her at a certain Cathedral door familiar to them both. After Jerry departs, Miss Pross is washing her face when she is surprised to see that Madame Defarge has entered the apartment. Madame Defarge demands to know the family's whereabouts. Miss Pross does not understand French and Madame Defarge speaks no English but the two women immediately understand that they are at cross-purposes. Madame Defarge inspects all the rooms but the one that Miss Pross blocks and the two women struggle and the pistol explodes and kills Madame Defarge. Miss Pross composes herself and then locks the apartment and flees. On her way to meet Jerry she drops the key in the river. When she meets Jerry he realizes that the poor woman has become deaf though he cannot understand why.
The tumbrels carrying those to be executed roll through the Paris streets. The doomed display varying countenances, from resolved to insane. John Barsad sees Sydney Carton holding the hand of a young girl and prays that he will not betray him. The Vengeance asks her friends in vain if they have seen Madame Defarge. As the Guillotine begins its work upon the fifty-two condemned to die, Sydney Carton and the seamstress hold hands and express their belief that God has sent them each other at this moment. They kiss each other's lips before they are parted. She is executed before him. Sydney Carton looks peaceful and sublime as he is led to the blade. Before he dies his thoughts are of the family that will live long and peacefully in England because of his sacrifice. He imagines that a son is born to them that is named for him and, as the blade falls, he says to himself, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.""
Analysis of Chapters 12-15
These chapters bring to the story to a close the story at the cost of two lives. Sydney Carton is able to fulfill his promise to give his life for Lucie's happiness by trading places with Darnay. Good, as personified by Miss Pross, triumphs over evil, personified by Madame Defarge when the latter dies by her own gun. Some critics have asserted that Carton's sacrifice is meant to be interpreted as a Christ-like act but others have insisted that because he dies for Lucie's happiness and not merely to save another his death is borne of selfish desires. In either case, Carton is depicted as having found true happiness in the moments before his death when he is able to bring comfort to the seamstress and assures her that like his own impending death hers will not be without purpose.",A Tale of Two Cities
173,David Copperfield: Summary: Chapters I-III," 
Preface
	The author expresses both pleasure and sorrow at finishing his novel ?pleasure at having successfully completed this lengthy project, and sorrow at parting from the work, which has become a part of him.
	Chapter I: I am born
	The adult David Copperfield narrates the story of his life, beginning with his birth.
	The women of David's neighborhood believe, based on the time of his birth, that he is destined to be unlucky and that he would possess the gift of seeing ghosts and spirits. On the first prediction, he comments that the story he will tell will reveal its truth or otherwise, and on the second prediction, he comments that he is not aware of having any such gift.
	David's father is already dead when he is born. An aunt of his father's, Miss Betsey Trotwood, turns up on the day of his birth. Betsey was once married to a man who beat her and tried to kill her, and she ended up paying him to stay away from her. Though Betsey was fond of David's father, she was contemptuous of his mother, Clara Copperfield, calling her ""a wax doll.?/p>
	This is the first time that Betsey has met Clara, and she gives her the nickname of Baby because of her youthful appearance. Betsey informs Clara that she is certain that she will give birth to a girl. She intends to be a friend to the girl, and to ensure that she does not place her trust in the type of man who will take advantage of her, as she herself did.
	Later, Mr. Chillip, the doctor, emerges from the birthing room with the news that Clara has had a boy. Without a word, Betsey walks out of the house, never to return.
	Chapter II: I observe
	David describes some of his earliest memories. He remembers his pretty mother, and the kindly nurse, Clara Peggotty, who runs the household. One evening, David is reading to Peggotty from a book about crocodiles. He asks Peggotty if a person whose spouse dies can marry again. Peggotty says that they can if they choose, though she sounds unenthusiastic.
	Clara comes in with Mr. Murdstone, a handsome man with black hair, eyes and whiskers, who is courting her. David takes an instant dislike to him. David falls asleep. When he wakes, he hears that both women are in tears. Peggotty is telling Clara that her former husband, David's father, would not have liked Mr. Murdstone.
	Mr. Murdstone returns one day and takes David on a trip to Lowestoft, a nearby town, to meet some of his business acquaintances. One of the men, Mr. Quinion, jokes with Mr. Murdstone about his courtship of Clara and David's dislike of him. David observes that the men seem to share his wariness of Mr. Murdstone, and that Mr. Murdstone never laughs with them.
	One evening, Peggotty asks David to accompany her on a two-week visit to her brother's at Yarmouth. He excitedly agrees. As he says goodbye to his mother, Mr. Murdstone appears at her side and tells her to control her emotions.
	Chapter III: I have a change
	Peggotty and David travel by carrier's cart to Yarmouth, where they are met at an inn by Peggotty's nephew, Ham. Ham takes them to his family's home, which is a boat converted into a house. Inside there is a smell of fish. Peggotty's brother, Daniel Peggotty, who owns the house, deals in seafood, which he stores in an outhouse. Mr. Peggotty lives in the house with his nephew, Ham, and his niece, Little Em'ly, whom he adopted when their fathers drowned at sea. Also living with Mr. Peggotty is Mrs. Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty's partner in a boat. Mr. Peggotty is an easy-going man who only becomes angry if his generosity in adopting destitute people is mentioned.
	Next morning, David goes out onto the beach with Little Em'ly, where they collect pebbles and fall in love with each other. Little Em'ly says that she is afraid of the sea, which has destroyed so many local men and boats. She also reveals that she wants to be a lady. The adult David reflects that perhaps it would have been better if the sea had swallowed Little Em'ly that morning, so that she would not have to suffer everything that she suffered since.
	Mrs. Gummidge turns out to be a depressed sort of woman, given to complaining that ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me.?She claims that while others may share the adverse conditions that cause her grief, ""I feel it more."" Mr. Peggotty remarks that ""She's been thinking of the old 'un,"" meaning her dead husband.
	At the end of their vacation, Peggotty and David set out for home. David is excited to see his mother again, but Peggotty tries to restrain his enthusiasm. When they reach home, David is baffled that his mother has not come out to the gate to meet him. He fears that she is dead. Peggotty reveals that Clara has married Mr. Murdstone.
	David finds his mother sitting with Mr. Murdstone by the fire. Clara rises to meet David, but Mr. Murdstone tells her again to control her emotions. David finds that his bedroom has been moved to a more distant room. There is a fierce black dog in the kennel in the yard, which springs out to attack him.
	Analysis of Chapters I-III
	The narrator, David Copperfield, looks back on his childhood and tells his story. Though he very occasionally interjects a comment from the perspective of the older and wiser adult, for the most part, he describes events as they appeared to him as a child without adult reflection. This has the effect of reinforcing the naivete and innocence of David as a character. For example, when David accompanies Mr. Murdstone to Lowestoft, Mr. Quinion jokes with the others about David's dislike of Mr. Murdstone. David, being a very young child, has no idea that ""Brooks of Sheffield"" is an invented name to hide the fact that the men are talking about him. In fact, David joins in their laughter at his own expense. It would have been easy for Dickens to add an adult comment to explain that Brooks of Sheffield is really David, but the fact that he does not enables the reader to reach this conclusion independently. The reader is thereby cast in the role of the knowing adult observer, and David retains his childish helplessness and innocence, engaging the reader's sympathy and pity. This authorial technique, in which the reader knows more of the truth than the protagonist does about the other characters' true motives, is called dramatic irony.
	Occasionally, Dickens breaks his practice of giving purely the child's view of David's life, as when the adult David comments that he sometimes feels it would have been better if Little Em'ly had drowned on the day they met, rather than suffer as she has done since. This is an example of foreshadowing, a technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel to create an ominous feeling. The reader is given a sense of Em'ly's future difficulties, setting up an expectation that makes him want to read on and find out what happens to the character.
	Betsey Trotwood's question to Clara Copperfield about whether she and her husband, David's father, were happily married, introduces one of the major themes of the novel: the importance of equality within marriage. Clara's response prompts Betsey to comment disapprovingly that Clara and her first husband were ""not equally matched."" This is a situation with which Betsey is all too familiar, as she herself has been dominated by a cruel husband. The scene with Betsey and Clara is also an example of foreshadowing. Here, Betsey's history warns the reader of the looming disaster of Clara's second marriage, in which she will also be dominated by a cruel husband (Mr. Murdstone). This warning is reinforced by David and Peggotty's instinctive dislike of Mr. Murdstone and by Peggotty's warning that Clara's first husband would not like Mr. Murdstone. The fact that David is removed to Yarmouth in order to allow the marriage to go ahead smoothly is also a foreshadowing of how David's family life will change: he will be excluded from the compact between his mother and her new husband.
	Another foreshadowing technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel is his use of a character's appearance to describe their soul. David's good-hearted and innocent mother is beautiful and childlike in appearance; Mr. Murdstone is as dark of soul as he is of hair; and Peggotty is as warm and honest as her ruddy face and work-roughened hands.
	As well as being defined by their appearance, many characters in the novel are defined by a catchphrase - just as, in a cartoon, a character is defined by one or two distinguishing characteristics, like a big nose or prominent ears. Mrs. Gummidge can be summed up by her catchphrase, ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me."" She remains loyal to her catchphrase until late in the novel, where she surprises everyone by turning into its opposite - but the catchphrase still rules supreme, even as she defies it.
	The characters do not change in their essence throughout the novel; their motivations are established at their first introduction, and remain constant. Little Em'ly retains her desire to be a lady, and it proves her undoing. Clara retains her babyish innocence, and Mr. Murdstone his desire to control her. Betsey's chief motivation is to ensure that no other girl should suffer at the hands of unscrupulous men, as she has. She is bitterly disappointed that Clara does not provide her with a girl child to fulfill her ambition, but in time, she will transfer her protective instinct to David.",David Copperfield

175,Walden: Summary,"Chapter 1
Summary – Chapter One ‘Economy’
	This work is written in the first person and in this first paragraph Thoreau explains how he wrote the ‘bulk’ of these pages when he lived in the woods, ‘a mile from any neighbour, in a house which I had built myself, on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by the labor of my hands only’. He also tells how he lived there for two years and two months and is now a ‘sojourner in civilized life again’. There is then an explanation of how his original reason for making his ‘affairs’ known were instigated by the inquiries of local ‘townsmen’.
	The discussion turns to local young men who inherit farms and how the inhabitants of Concord appear to him ‘to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways.’ He compares such workers with machines and goes on to say how we do not treat each other ‘tenderly’. Comparisons are also made between a life that is all work and slavery and says it is worst of all ‘when you are the slave-driver of yourself’. He sees the majority of men as living lives of ‘quiet desperation’ and argues that what is called ‘resignation’ is ‘desperation’.
	The necessities of life are then discussed and he points out that for some creatures this just refers to food. He argues that humans require ‘Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel’ and our bodies need to keep warm, ‘to keep the vital heat in us’. He goes on to say that the ‘luxuriously rich’ are not warm but ‘unnaturally hot’ and describes them as being ‘cooked’ ‘à la mode’.
	He is speaking to the ‘mass of men who are discontented’ and could be improving their lives rather than complaining and the ‘seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, ...’ The idea of success is seen to be measured by money in this society.
	He digresses to talk about clothing and how people are judged by what they wear. He then criticizes changing fashions and says how ‘we’ worship it. He moves on to discuss shelter and refers to Gookin’s account of houses in 1674 when he was the ‘superintendent of the Indian subjects to the Massachusetts Colony.’ Here, Gookin explained how the best were covered in tree bark and found ‘wigwams’ to be ‘as warm as the best English houses’.
	Thoreau points out the irony that in ‘modern civilized society’ not half the people own their own homes whereas in (so-called) ‘savage society’ all Native Americans own theirs. Few farmers own their land outright and he says how houses are so ‘unwieldy’ that we are often ‘imprisoned’ rather than housed. This is especially so when trying to sell them on. He also discusses the squalor of the degraded poor in the United States, Ireland and England. He looks back to an account of the early settlers and how they made homes by digging into the ground.
	The narrative turns to his ‘experiment’ and how he borrowed an axe near the end of March 1845 and ‘went down to the woods by Walden Pond’ and cut down some pines for timber.
	By mid-April, his house was ‘framed’ and he bought a shanty for the boards he can take from it. He dug a cellar and in May he raised the frame with his acquaintances and began to live there on the 4th July.
	The discussion turns to architecture and he then explains how the house was ten feet by fifteen and had a garret and a closet as well as windows and a fireplace. He itemises the cost of everything and in all it came to $28 12½.
	Chapter One continues to discuss the price of this building and Thoreau points out how a Cambridge College student’s room is $30 a year and goes on to question education and the expense of it. He suggests we should live a life rather than just studying it as a way of learning and criticizes his education too. He reports that he was astonished to learn on leaving college that he had ‘studied navigation’. He then asks about the usefulness of the railroad and describes at as only ‘comparatively good’.
	With regard to his home, he explains that he planted beans, potatoes, corn, peas and turnips and calculates that after outgoings he made $8 71½ and thinks in all he ‘was doing better than any farmer in Concord did that year’. He also outlines his sense of independence and how he had no animal working for him and owned his house.
	He moves on to criticize the building of monuments, and the Pyramids, and says he would like to know the people who did not build such things, as these would be ones ‘who were above such trifling’.
	A list is given on his outgoings on food and he explains he ended up spending $25 21¾, which is almost what he started with. He speaks of the adaptability of ‘man’ and questions the practice of having too many possessions, such as too much furniture, and point to Native Americans, such as the Mucclasse, who get rid of things like worn out clothes and burn them. He sees this as a form of purification and uses ‘the Mexicans’ as an example too.
	He explains how for more than five years he has found that he can work for six weeks in a year to meet all his expenses. He tried teaching just for the income and describes it as ‘a failure’. He wanted freedom and found the work of a day-labourer offered this.
	He goes on to advise people to find their own way in the world and knows that some in the town have said that his way of living is selfish, and he responds that ‘Doing-good’ does not agree with his constitution. He follows this up by arguing that philanthropy is overrated and adds that, ‘it is our selfishness which overrates it’. This chapter ends with a verse called ‘The Pretensions of Poverty’ by T. Carew.
 
Analysis – Chapter One
	By questioning the work ethic that he sees as dominating the lives of those around him, Thoreau also questions the underlying puritanical strain that has considered work as bringing us closer to God. In this chapter, and throughout the book at various times, he turns this around and criticizes the way workers live like slaves rather than enjoying life.
	This is also a practical guide to how he set about living as he did at Walden Pond and this part of Chapter One gives some details about how he created his home from very little. His example demonstrates that it is possible to do without luxuries such as changing fashion and too much heat and because of this it is possible to see that he also holds on to some aspects of Puritanism.
	The narrative continues to reinforce the early part of Chapter One as the need for so many possessions is questioned more fully. By looking back to the example of Native Americans, he underlines how the so-called civilized society is inferior to that of so-called heathens.
	His relationship to work, and the idea of working for freedom rather than for the sake of it, is explained in more depth as he relates how he has found that working for just six weeks has been enough to earn him the required amount of income. The criticism of philanthropy comes from a defence that he is not living selfishly.

176,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 2","
	 
In another public place in Rome, Caesar, accompanied by his followers, encounters a soothsayer, who tells him to beware the ides of March (March 15). Caesar dismisses him as a dreamer. Caesar and his entourage exit, leaving Cassius and Brutus to engage in conversation. Cassius mentions that recently Brutus has not seemed so friendly towards him as he usually is. Brutus replies that it is nothing personal; he is troubled by some private business and this is affecting his behavior towards others. Cassius hints that he knows Brutus better than Brutus himself does. He suggests that others in Rome who are suffering under Caesar's oppression have wished that Brutus would open his eyes to their plight and (Cassius implies) do something about it. He promises to tell Brutus something about himself that he is as yet unaware of.  
	As shouts are heard from the crowd offstage, Brutus says he fears that the people will choose Caesar for their king. Even though he loves Caesar, Brutus does not want him to be crowned king. Cassius then gives a long speech in which he explains that Caesar is not fit to hold the great office that he does. He expresses his frustration at the inferior position he occupies in relation to Caesar, even though he was born just as free as the man who now rules. Cassius relates an incident that showed he was a better swimmer than Caesar. He also observed Caesar when the latter had a fever, and he was not impressed. Caesar trembled and groaned, his eyes looked dull and his voice sounded feeble, like that of a sick girl. And yet this Caesar, who is physically weak, rules over Rome.  
	More shouts are heard from the crowd outside, which Brutus takes to be a sign that new honors are being heaped on Caesar. Cassius continues his complaint against Caesar and bemoans the fact that so much power is concentrated in one man. He castigates Romans for allowing it.  
	Brutus says he will consider Cassius's words, but he does not want to commit himself yet.  
	Caesar and his entourage return. Caesar tells Mark Antony that Cassius is a dangerous man, although he hastens to add that he is not afraid of him, since he fears no one. But men like Cassius, Caesar observes, are never at rest while someone else holds power over them.  
	After Caesar exits, Casca explains to Cassius and Brutus that Antony just offered Caesar a crown three times. Each time Caesar rejected it, but each time he did so with greater reluctance. The crowd cheered when he rejected it for the third time, at which Caesar had an epileptic fit and fell down foaming at the mouth. Just before he collapsed, he theatrically opened his doublet, offering the crowd his throat to cut.  
	Casca also mentions that Flavius and Murellus have been executed for removing crowns from Caesar's statues. Their acts were considered treasonous.  
	After all have left, Cassius is left alone. He reflects that although Brutus is a noble man, it is possible to be lure him away from his natural inclinations and persuade him to join the conspiracy to kill Caesar. Cassius plans to write some letters, in different handwriting, and toss them through Brutus's window that night, as if they came from several different Roman citizens. The letters will confirm how high Brutus is held in public esteem and hint at Caesar's ambition.  
	Analysis
	This long scene introduces Caesar and the conspirators. Caesar is a commanding figure, always giving orders and expecting to be obeyed. He also shows acute psychological insight, since he rightly identifies Cassius as a dangerous man. Caesar is also presented as less than robust physically. Cassius's personal envy of Caesar is revealed, although he never demonstrates how Caesar's physical weakness makes him unsuitable to govern. Cassius's cunning is shown in his subtle attempts to bring Brutus around to his way of thinking. Once he has created an opening, Cassius is resourceful and knows how to reel Brutus into his plot by flattering him.  
	Like the first scene, this scene shows how the common people play a significant role. Politicians try to win them over and are affected by how they react, as is shown in Casca's report of the offering of the crown to Caesar. Caesar is ""playing the crowd,"" affecting not to want what he really covets. Shakespeare does not show this action directly, informing the audience only through Casca's telling of it, because he wants to reserve such a scene for the climactic Act 3 scene 2, in which Brutus and then Antony address the citizenry directly.  ",Julius Caesar
177,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 3","
	 
That night there is a fearsome thunderstorm. Meeting Cicero in a Roman street, Casca tells of strange things he has seen and heard about that night. Women swear they saw a hundred men, covered in fire, walking up and down the streets; he himself saw a lion at the capital and a man with his hand on fire that flamed like twenty torches without burning him. These strange events mean that something ominous is about to take place.  
	Cassius enters. He has been wandering the streets during the storm. He tells Casca that the unnatural disturbances are a warning that something is badly wrong with Roman society. He says that he could name a man who is every bit as ominous as the signs in the stormy night. Casca knows that he refers to Caesar, and Cassius says that Romans are feeble because they put up with his tyranny.  
	Casca believes that the following day, the Roman Senate will offer Caesar a crown. Cassius boasts that he has the power, and will use it, to overthrow tyranny. Casca agrees, and Cassius continues, saying that the only reason Caesar acts like a tyrant is because he knows Romans are weak and will not resist. Casca and Cassius agree to spearhead the plot to assassinate Caesar.  
	Another conspirator, Cinna, enters. Cassius gives him the letters he has written and tells Cinna to throw them into Brutus's house. After doing this he is to meet Cassius and some other conspirators at Pompey's Porch, which is the portico of a theatre built by Pompey. Cassius tells Casca that Brutus is three-quarters won over to their cause, and on their next meeting he will embrace it fully.  
	Analysis
	As often occurs in Shakespeare's plays (King Lear for example), a disturbance in the macrocosm (the violent storm) indicates a disturbance in the microcosm, the world of man and his society. The scene also reveals more of the central characters: Cassius's ambition for power and Brutus's decency and reputation as a man of honor. This is why the conspirators need Brutus on their side: it will make their cause seem respectable.  
",Julius Caesar
178,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 2, Scene 1","
	 
Brutus reflects in a soliloquy that he has nothing against Caesar personally, but Caesar must be killed for the general good of Rome. He explains that if Caesar is crowned king, that may change his nature, and he may abuse his power. He must be assassinated to prevent this possibility from taking place; in other words, Caesar must be killed not for what he is but for what he may become.  
	Brutus's servant Lucius brings him the letter that Casca has tossed in through the window. Brutus reads it out loud to himself and puzzles over the meaning. The letter urges him to take action for the sake of Rome, and it appears that he has made his decision to join the conspirators. Lucius enters and confirms that the next day is the ides of March. Brutus, alone, confesses that since Cassius first sounded him out about Caesar, he has not slept.  
	The conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus Cimber and Trebonius enter. Cassius demands that they take an oath to cement their resolve to assassinate Caesar. But Brutus refuses, saying that they need only their own cause to spur them onward. As Romans they are honor-bound to keep any promise they have made.  
	The conspirators then discuss whether to enlist Cicero in their cause. Cicero is old and wise, and his support would give their cause more legitimacy in the eyes of the people. But Brutus advises against this. He says Cicero will never join an enterprise that is led by anyone other than himself. The conspirators agree to leave him out of their plans. Next they discuss whether they should kill Antony as well as Caesar. Cassius advocates killing them both, because as a close friend of Caesar, Antony could prove troublesome to them. But Brutus says no; killing both men will make the conspirators seem too bloodthirsty, and anyway, Antony will be made powerless when Caesar is killed. Brutus hopes that if they go about their purpose with dignity rather than wrathful passion, the common people will see them not as murderers but as cleansers of the body politic.  
	Cassius remains uneasy, but the conspirators side with Brutus and decide not to kill Antony.  
	It is three in the morning and the conspirators agree to part. But Cassius is concerned that Caesar, whom he believes to be superstitious, may not go to the capital later that morning because of the strange apparitions during the night. Decius says he knows how to talk to Caesar and persuade him. He promises to bring Caesar to the capital. Cassius says they will all be there at eight in the morning to make sure that Caesar comes.  
	After the conspirators leave, Brutus's wife Portia enters. Brutus is surprised to see her up in the middle of the night. She knows Brutus is troubled by something and asks if she may know what it is. Brutus replies that he is sick, but Portia does not believe him. She knows that it is Brutus's mind that is troubled, and again demands to know what is wrong. She reassures him that she is strong enough to know the truth, and that she will not disclose it to anyone. Brutus is touched by her pleas, but then there is a knock at the door, and Brutus sends Portia away, saying that he will tell her everything later.
	At the door is Caius Ligarius. Although he is sick, he is willing to join the conspirators.  
	Analysis
	The scene gives insight into Brutus's character. He thinks deeply about his decision and does not join the conspirators lightly. He thinks not of himself, or what he might gain from the assassination, but of the welfare of Rome. It is also clear that because he is the man most respected in Rome, the other conspirators defer to his judgments. However, Brutus is not always right, as is shown by his comments about how Antony should be spared because he will be powerless without Caesar.  
	The pleadings of Portia reveal Brutus's inner conflict. She is clearly a noble woman, a worthy wife for an honorable Roman, but Brutus cannot bring himself to confide in her. Perhaps he is trying to protect her, but it may also be that he in the inner recesses of his heart he is ashamed of what he has decided to do. Either way, Brutus appears as a man who, although he has decided on a course of action, remains divided against himself.  
	The scene also reveals the extent of Cassius's cunning. He thinks ahead, sees every possible obstacle, and tries to prevent each one.

It is still night, and the storm continues. Caesar's wife has a dream in which Caesar is murdered. She tries to persuade Caesar not to leave the house that day. Caesar will not be persuaded, so Calphurnia recounts some of the strange things that have been seen by the night watch. Graves have given up their dead, and there was the noise of battle in the air. But Caesar still insists he will not change his plans. He says that the disturbances pertain to the world in general, not to himself, and anyway, he does not fear death. Then a servant arrives and tells him that the priests, his spiritual advisers, are also telling him not to go out. Again, Caesar will not listen. But Calphurnia tries again, urging Caesar to send Mark Antony in his place to the Senate, with word that Caesar is sick. Caesar finally agrees to stay at home. 
	But then Decius enters to escort Caesar to the Senate. Caesar explains that he is not going, although he refuses to say that he is sick. Decius says he must give a reason for Caesar's nonappearance, or the Senate will laugh at him when he delivers the news. Caesar says it is simply his will that he will not come. But for Decius's own satisfaction, he confides in him that it is because his wife fears the bad omens in the stormy night. She also had a dream in which she saw his statue running with blood. Decius tells him that the dream has been misinterpreted. It really means that he is the lifeblood of Rome and everyone wants to receive some small aspect of his person, as a blessing. Caesar approves of this interpretation. Decius goes on to say that the Senate plans to award him a crown that day; if he does not arrive in person, they may rethink their decision. Some may say Caesar is afraid. Caesar, convinced by the argument, reverses his decision.  
	Brutus and the other conspirators enter, as well as Publius, who knows nothing of the plot. Antony also arrives. Caesar invites them all to share some wine with him before they all set forth for the capital. 
	Analysis
	This scene further reveals Caesar's character. He thinks of himself as courageous and fearless. However, he is also aware of the power of public opinion, since the one thing that persuades him to go to the capital is not that the senators expect him to, but because if he does not go he may be thought of as fearful. This may turn public opinion against him, since no politician, either in ancient Rome or now, wants to be perceived as lacking in courage.

	Analysis
	This scene, like the last, serves to build up tension. Portia clearly has a bad feeling about what may be about to happen.  
 
",Julius Caesar
182,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 3, Scene 1","
	 
As Caesar and his company walk to the Senate, Caesar passes the soothsayer, who reminds him that the ides of March are not yet passed. Artemidorus tries to get Caesar to read his letter, and says it is personal. Caesar rejects it, saying that personal items should be dealt with last.  
	Brutus fears that the plot has been discovered when Publius remarks that he hopes their enterprise will thrive. Publius then goes straight to Caesar, and the conspirators fear that he is warning Caesar of the plot. But then they see Publius smiling and notice that Caesar does not react badly to his words.  
	Meanwhile, Trebonius draws Antony out of the way, and the conspirators prepare to put their plan into action. First, Metellus Cimber kneels and puts his petition to Caesar. But Caesar refuses his request. Metellus Cimber's brother will remain banished. Metellus tries again, and Brutus joins him in his plea, to Caesar's surprise. Then Cassius kneels and joins the appeal to Caesar. But Caesar remains unmoved, declaring that he is as constant as the north star. He prides himself on being unbending.  
	As Cinna and Decius protest Caesar's decision, Casca is the first to stab Caesar; the others follow, including Brutus. Cinna and Cassius tell the senators and others who witnessed the assassination to run to the streets and proclaim that tyranny is dead and liberty and freedom live. Brutus tries to reassure the horrified onlookers. He also reassures Publius that they intend no harm to him or anyone else, but he should leave because the people may attack the killers and Publius might be caught in the middle of it. He says that no one should have to face the consequences of this deed except those who performed it.  
	Trebonius enters and informs them that Antony has fled to his house and the whole city is in an uproar. Brutus tells the assassins to cover their arms and swords in Caesar's blood and go to the people proclaiming peace, liberty and freedom.  
	A servant arrives with a conciliatory message from Antony. Antony says that if Brutus will allow him to come safely, he would like to hear their explanation of why Caesar deserved to die. If Brutus will do this, Antony promises him his loyalty. Brutus agrees to these terms and is confident that he will win Antony's support and friendship.  
	Antony enters and says he does not know what they intend, but as far as he is concerned they can kill him now if they wish. He cannot think of any better time than this, the hour of Caesar's death, to die himself.  
	Brutus explains that they acted as they did because of pity for the condition of Rome under Caesar. He adds that they mean no harm to Antony, and Cassius confirms this. Brutus says that they first must calm the populace and then they will explain exactly why they assassinated Caesar. Antony replies that he does not doubt their wisdom, and one by one he shakes the conspirators' hands. But then he praises Caesar and asks forgiveness of him for making peace with his killers.  
	Cassius tries to find out whether Antony will be one of their supporters. Antony replies that he is their friend, but he still wants to hear how they justify their act. Brutus promises they will.  
	Antony asks that he may be permitted to speak at Caesar's funeral. Brutus immediately grants this request, but Cassius pulls him aside, saying that they should refuse to let Antony speak, since he may sway people against them. Brutus tries to reassure him by saying that he will speak first and tell the people why Caesar was killed, and will then emphasize that Antony speaks with their permission. The assassins want Caesar to have all the ceremony that is due to him; Brutus says this will rebound to their advantage. Cassius is not convinced, but he does not oppose Brutus's plan. Brutus gives Antony permission to take Caesar's body. He tells him he may praise Caesar in his speech, but must also say that he does so with their permission.  
	Everyone exits except Antony, who now reveals his true thoughts. He laments the death of such a great man and apologizes for being so meek with the murderers. He promises revenge against Caesar's killers. There will be fierce civil war. Caesar's spirit, accompanied by Ate, the god of discord, will be hot for revenge.  
	A servant of Octavius, Caesar's adopted son, arrives, saying that Octavius is on his way to Rome. Antony sends a message that it is too dangerous for Octavius to come.  
	Finally, Antony says that in his funeral oration, he will test the way the people have received the death of Caesar.  
	Analysis
	It is significant that all the conspirators, rather than just one, stab Caesar. They want to emphasize that they are acting collectively, and that this is the way Rome should be governed, not by one dictatorial leader. By ensuring that they all participate in the killing, they hope to bring more legitimacy to their cause: one man may act from bad motives, but an entire group of respected Romans is more likely to be perceived as acting in good faith for just reasons.  
	After the killing, no one is sure how the crowd, which is as much an actor in this play as any of the characters, will react to the news. The assassins know how volatile the people can be, which is why they immediately try to get a positive message out (rather as modern politicians try to create a positive ""spin"" on important events when they address the media). Another unknown factor is Mark Antony. No one is sure how he is going to react, and the cat-and-mouse game between the politicians begins. Cassius is especially concerned since he knows how dangerous Antony might be. For his part, Antony is in a very tricky situation, and he has to play his cards carefully. When he meets the conspirators, he shows great self-control. He is quite capable of putting on a courteous face to the killers and hinting that he may come round to their cause.

Brutus addresses the crowd, saying that while he loved Caesar, he loved Rome more. He asks them whether they would prefer it if Caesar were alive and they all slaves, or Caesar were dead and they were free? Brutus honors Caesar for his bravery but says he killed him because he was ambitious. Who wants to be a slave? he asks. Who does not love his country? He invites a response from the crowd, which cries out in support of him. Brutus concludes that he can have offended no one by his act.  
	As Antony enters with Caesar's body, Brutus tells the crowd that he killed his best friend for the sake of Rome, and that he has the same dagger reserved for himself, when his country should need his death. He then leaves to the cheers of the crowd, insisting that everyone stay to hear Antony's speech. The crowd is convinced by Brutus's speech that Caesar was a tyrant.  
	Antony addresses the crowd. He says he came to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Brutus has said that Caesar was ambitious, and if that was true, then it was a bad fault in Caesar, and he has fully paid for it.  
	Antony points out that he speaks with the permission of the assassins, and he calls Brutus an honorable man, as are all they all. He says that Caesar was his friend and always behaved fairly to him. Then he repeats that Brutus said Caesar was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. But then he begins to cast doubt on the case against Caesar. He points out that Caesar brought home many captives to Rome, whose ransoms increased Rome's revenues. Was that ambitious? When the poor suffered, Caesar pitied and wept with them. Did that seem ambitious? He repeats for a third time that that Brutus said Caesar was ambitious, and that Brutus is an honorable man. 
	Next, he reminds the crowd that three times he tried to present Caesar with a crown, and each time Caesar rejected it. Was that ambitious? Once more Antony repeats the reference to Brutus and the fact that he is honorable. He claims that he is not there to disprove what Brutus has said, only to speak what he knows. He asks the crowd that since they all loved Caesar once, why can they not mourn for him? For a moment he is overcome by tears and has to pause.  
	Antony's speech is beginning to have its effect. Convinced by the points he has made, the crowd is ready to change sides and denounce Brutus.  
	Continuing, Antony claims it is not his intention to stir up rage against Cassius and Brutus (who are honorable men). Then he produces Caesar's will. If the people could hear it, he says, even though he does not intend to read it, they would kiss Caesar's wounds, by which he means that they would be extremely grateful to him.  
	The crowd clamors to hear the will, but Antony says it is not good for them to know how much Caesar loved them; it will only inflame them and make them angry. 
	The crowd continues to call for the will. Persuaded by the clamor, tells them to form a circle around Caesar's corpse. Antony points to each of the many wounds in Caesar's mantle, describing which was made by which conspirator. He makes particular play with the wound caused by Brutus, whom Caesar loved. When Caesar saw Brutus stab him, he was overcome by Brutus' ingratitude far more than any physical wounds. For the first time, Antony refers to the assassination as treason.  
	Then he pulls back the mantle and shows Caesar's body. The crowd is shocked and calls for revenge. Antony asks them to restrain themselves, although as he explains himself, referring again to the ""honorable"" men who killed Caesar, and saying that he has no gift of oratory, unlike Brutus, to stir men to action. But if he were Brutus, and Brutus Antony, then he would speak with passion and call for mutiny in Rome.  
	The crowd is about to scatter and stir up a rebellion when Antony reminds them that they have not heard the will yet. Antony announces that Caesar gives to every Roman citizen the sum of seventy-five drachmaes. He has also left his forest and orchards to be public pleasure-grounds, where anyone can walk.  
	The common people rush off, vowing to burn down the assassins' houses. Antony is satisfied at what his words have achieved and waits for whatever events unfold.  
	A servant enters and tells Antony that Octavius, and Lepidus have arrived. He also says that Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome. Antony assumes it is because they heard of how he had stirred the people up against them.  
	Analysis
	Brutus makes an effective speech that appeals to reason. But he is far surpassed by the brilliant cunning of Antony, who plays directly on the emotions of the crowd. Through the use of irony, he not only manages to suggest that Brutus and his fellow conspirators are not honorable men, he does so without violating the conditions imposed on him: that he not speak ill of the assassins. Not only are Antony's words devastating in the way they undermine Brutus's speech, he is also a master actor. The pause for tears, for example, whether sincere or not, is dramatically effective, and Antony's use of his props, the dead body-who could not be moved by the sight of Caesar's bloody corpse?-and the will, are also superb in their timing and effect.  
	It is clear that Brutus has made a series of miscalculations. His biggest mistake is to allow Antony to speak at the funeral. He then compounds the error by leaving the scene after his own speech, which effectively gives Antony the last word. It seems that Brutus is so concerned with acting nobly (or perhaps trying to convince everyone, including himself, that he is doing so), that he makes the kind of blunders that Cassius, more ruthless and with a fiercer hunger for power, would never have made if left to himself. In the game of power politics, ruthlessness pays bigger dividends than nobility.

In a street in Rome, Cinna the poet is accosted by a crowd of pro-Caesar commoners. He says he is going to Caesar's funeral-as a friend. When he says his name is Cinna, the crowd wants to kill him, since they think he is one of the conspirators. Even though he protests that he is Cinna the poet, they drag him off just the same.  
	Analysis
	Perhaps the reason for this short scene is to show the savagery and irrationality of the mob when ignited by bloodlust. It does not matter to them that Cinna had nothing to do with the assassination.

At Antony's house in Rome, Antony, Lepidus and Octavius are negotiating about who should be killed. Lepidus accepts that his brother must be one of them, but on condition that Publius, Antony's nephew, also dies. Antony consents. 
	Antony sends Lepidus on an errand, and then complains to Octavius that Lepidus is not worthy to be one of the three leaders of the Roman Empire. When Octavius points out that Antony just accepted Lepidus's vote on a matter of life and death, Antony replies that Lepidus has his uses, but is of no more worth than a beast of burden, which having carried the load required of it can be dispatched to a pasture. Octavius protests that Lepidus is a brave soldier. Antony replies that so is his own horse. And just as a horse has to be trained, so Lepidus is a follower, not a leader. He has to be taught what to do. He should be considered a tool, to be used by others.  
	Antony informs Octavius that Brutus and Cassius are raising an army against them, and they must prepare to respond.  
	Analysis
	This scene shows the balance of power in the triumvirate. Lepidus is of no consequence, and Antony, as the older man and more experienced soldier, has the upper hand over Octavius.

At a camp near Sardis, Brutus and his generals enter. Brutus hints at some slight he has suffered at the hands of Cassius. He inquires of Lucilius how Cassius received him. Lucilius replies that he was greeted with respect but without the usual friendliness. Brutus interprets this to mean that his friendship with Cassius has grown cold and that he can no longer rely on it.  
	Cassius enters and accuses Brutus of wronging him. Brutus denies it, but does not want to dispute in front of their generals. He takes Cassius inside his tent so they can discuss the matter alone.  
	Analysis
	This scene moves the action forward and prepares the ground for the quarrel between Brutus and Cassius that is about to take place.  
",Julius Caesar
187,"Julius Caesar: Novel Summary: Act 4, Scene 3","
	 
Cassius explains that Brutus accused a man named Lucius Pella of taking bribes. Cassius wrote to him, saying that he knew Lucius Pella was innocent. But Brutus just ignored him.  
	Brutus says it was unnecessary for Cassius to intervene in such a small matter. Then he says that Cassius himself sometimes allows unworthy people to buy offices in his service. Cassius, angered, says that if anyone other than Brutus made such a remark, he would kill him. But Brutus is not intimidated. He says that they killed Caesar in the name of justice. Should one of them now accept bribes?  
	Cassius warns him to stop, and says he is more experienced than Brutus and therefore able to make management decisions. They fall to quarreling. Brutus tells Cassius he is hot-tempered and should control his anger. But Brutus will not let it disturb him. They quarrel further over whether Cassius said he was a better soldier than Brutus. Cassius says that even Caesar would not have dared to anger him in this way, and Brutus responds by saying Cassius would not have dared to have provoked him to anger.  
	Brutus then goes to the heart of the matter. He wrote to Cassius, asking for money so he could pay his soldiers, because he could not bring himself to raise it by taxing the peasants. But Cassius refused.  
	Cassius denies the charge and blames his messenger. He protests that Brutus exaggerates his faults. He gives a despairing speech in which he says he is weary of the world, and he invites Brutus to kill him with his own dagger. This breaks the tension, because Brutus realizes that it is better just to let Cassius be angry when the mood takes him. It is soon over. Brutus confesses that he spoke in anger too. They are reconciled. Brutus promises that if Cassius should be angry with him in the future, he will not take it so seriously.  
	There is a disturbance outside as a poet urges the two men to be friends. After this, Brutus explains to Cassius that he is weighed down by grief, and that is why he became angry. His wife Portia, distressed by his absence and the strength of Octavius and Antony, committed suicide by swallowing burning coals. Brutus and Cassius drink wine to forget their sorrows.  
	Titinius and Messala enter and describe the military situation. Octavius and Antony are marching on them with a large army. They have put a hundred senators to death. Brutus has different information, that only seventy senators were killed.  
	Brutus raises the question of whether they should march to Philippi to meet the opposing army. Cassius says it would be better not to. They should let Antony's army advance, so they get exhausted, while Brutus and Cassius's forces stay fresh. Brutus disagrees. He warns that as the opposing army advances, they may pick up new recruits from the towns they pass through, where Brutus and Cassius are unpopular. But if Brutus and Cassius march on Philippi, they can prevent this happening. He insists that the time is right for them to strike. Their forces are at their strongest. If they wait, their strength may decline, while the enemy's will increase. Cassius accepts Brutus's argument and they part on good terms.  
	Brutus's servant Lucius plays some music. After Lucius falls asleep, Brutus reads a book. He is startled by the appearance of the ghost of Caesar. The ghost says that he will reappear to Brutus at Philippi. Then he disappears. Brutus awakens his servants, but none of them saw the ghost.  
	Analysis
	This scene shows the instability of the alliance between Brutus and Cassius. First, their personalities clash. Cassius is hot-tempered, but Brutus, although calmer, becomes tiresome in his insistence on his own honesty and rectitude. Second, the two men rarely agree on strategy. Cassius again makes the mistake of deferring to Brutus's judgment. But the scene also shows Brutus's decency, in his gentle concern for the welfare of his servants. We are also reminded that although Caesar is dead, his ghostly presence still dominates the play.

On the plains of Philippi, Octavius and Antony discuss the situation. Octavius says the enemy is planning to attack, contrary to what Antony had suggested. Antony replies that they are just putting on a false show of courage. The two men prepare for battle, although they disagree on tactics. Antony wants Octavius to take the left side of the field, while he takes the right. Octavius wants it the other way around.  
	Before the battle begins, Octavius, Antony, Brutus and Cassius meet and trade insults. Cassius reproaches Brutus for sparing Antony's life. If he had not done so, they would not now have to listen to his aggressive words. Octavius says he will not stop until Caesar's death is avenged. Cassius denounces him as a schoolboy who does not deserve the honor of being killed by Brutus; he also insults Antony's love of revelry. Antony and Octavius depart, ready for battle. 
	Cassius tells his servant Messala that it is his birthday. He also tells of an omen: as they journeyed from Sardis, two eagles swooped down and perched on their banner. The eagles remained there all the way to Philippi. But that morning they departed. In their place are ravens, crows and kites, which look down on Cassius's army as if they were prey. He fears that this is a bad omen. Messala urges him not to believe it, and Cassius says he only partly does, and he is fresh and ready for battle.  
	Cassius tells Brutus that if they lose this battle, this will be the last time they speak to each other. He asks what Brutus would plan to do in such a situation. Brutus says he does not intend to commit suicide. Cassius asks him if he would allow himself to be led in triumph through the streets of Rome. Brutus says this will never happen. They bid each other an affectionate farewell.  
	Analysis
	Antony and Octavius are supremely confident. The focus of the scene is on Brutus and Cassius, who contemplate the coming battle with a sense of fatalism. Although they do not say it outright, they fear they will be defeated.

The battle goes badly for Cassius's troops. Cassius angrily reports that his own soldiers have run from the enemy. Brutus appears to be having some success, but his soldiers have fallen to looting.  
	Pindarus tells Cassius to flee because Antony's troops are upon them. Cassius refuses. He sends Titinius to investigate whether there really are enemy soldiers at their tents, as Pindarus told him. He sends Pindarus higher up the hill to gather information. But Cassius knows in his heart that he is defeated. Pindarus reports that Titinius has been captured. This is the final blow for Cassius, who instructs Pindarus to kill him with his sword, the same sword that killed Caesar. Cassius dies.  
	Titanius and Messala enter, reporting that Brutus has triumphed over Octavius even as Cassius's army has fallen to Antony. They discover the dead Cassius. Titanius laments that Cassius killed himself because he misunderstood the situation. Titanius had in fact been welcomed and treated like a friend; he had not been captured at all. Filled with grief, he kills himself.  
	Brutus enters with Messala, who has brought him the news of Cassius's death. Brutus exclaims that Caesar is mighty yet, and it is his spirit that has caused their defeat. He laments the death of two great Romans, and then tells his generals to prepare for another round of battle.  
	Analysis
	This scene is a good illustration of what is sometimes called the ""fog of war."" Reliable information is hard to come by, and Cassius dies because of it.

On the battlefield, Brutus urges his men on. Cato is killed. Lucilius, claiming that he is Brutus in order to confuse the enemy, is captured. Antony's soldiers tell him they have captured Brutus, but when Antony asks where he is (knowing that Lucilius is not Brutus) Lucilius tells him that Brutus is safe and will never be taken alive. Antony orders that Lucilius be well treated, since he would sooner have him as a friend than an enemy.  
	Analysis
	Antony reveals his political skill. He knows how to make allies of former enemies-something that Brutus had conspicuously failed to do.

Brutus and his soldiers, defeated in battle, stop to rest. Brutus makes it clear that he wishes to be killed. Clitus refuses, as does Dardanius. Then Brutus asks Volumnius, telling him that he has twice seen the ghost of Caesar and he knows his time to die has come. Volumnius also refuses. There are sounds of continuing battle, and Clitus, Dardanius and Volumnius flee. Brutus says he will follow. One man remains, Strato, and he holds Brutus's sword as Brutus runs on to it. Brutus dies.  
	The victorious Antony and Octavius enter. Antony pays tribute to the dead Brutus by calling him the noblest Roman of them all.  
	Analysis
	Brutus's suicide (even though it is something he said he would not do) is perhaps a nobler end than that of Cassius, who asked to be killed by one of his own men. Antony's praise of Brutus seems genuine, since he has no reason to lie, and accords with Brutus's view of himself.  ",Julius Caesar

One day she remembers Mr. Earnshaw going on a journey and promising to bring back a fiddle for Hindley, a riding whip for Cathy and apples and pears for her. He is gone a long while, and when he comes back he has with him an orphan that he could not let starve in the street. The fiddle is crushed, and he has lost the whip, and the children and his wife do not like the dirty, ragged, black-haired child that he has brought home. He is named Heathcliff, and soon he and Cathy are good friends, but Hindley still hates him. Mr. Earnshaw thinks much of Heathcliff and raises him as part of the family, taking his side against his own son Hindley often.

She thinks that if she married Heathcliff they would be beggars, and if she marries Linton, she can help Heathcliff to rise and get him away from her brother. When Joseph comes in looking for Heathcliff, Ellen calls for him outside but gets no answer. She then tells Catherine that he had heard some of what she said, and she gets frightened. Catherine runs outside to look for Heathcliff, and finally comes back, saying she will not go upstairs until she gets to talk to him.

Ellen sees Edgar in the house and tells him what she saw between Heathcliff and Isabella and that he and Catherine are fighting in the kitchen. He has a few servants wait outside, and he goes into the kitchen and tells Catherine that he has been too lenient, but that from now on Heathcliff is not welcome in their home and must leave instantly. Heathcliff is amused by Linton's threats, and when Linton signals Ellen to let the servants in, Catherine realizes what is going on and locks the door, scolding Edgar for not being man enough to face Heathcliff alone.

Hindley had planned to be at Catherine's funeral and had stayed up and tried not to drink, but then he got in suicidal low spirits and had to stay home and drink. She and Hindley were together when they heard Heathcliff finally coming home. Hindley asked if they should lock him out, and they did. Then Hindley told her that they should return his violence and treachery and Isabella agreed. He then however, took a pistol out. This is not what Isabella had meant, and she could not let Hindley kill Heathcliff, so she tried to warn him. They all yelled angrily at each other until Heathcliff broke through a window and jumped at Hindley. The knife part of the gun struck Hindley, and while was down Heathcliff beat him. He then called Joseph in to care for Hindley and clean up his blood, but remembering Isabella, he made her do it.
	The next morning Isabella came down and saw that Hindley was quite ill. Isabella was glad to see how much Heathcliff was grieving over Catherine as she wanted to see him suffer. She said that Catherine would not have let him beat on Hindley like that, and that everyone knew that she would be alive now if not for Heathcliff. This angers Heathcliff much, and he throws a knife at Isabella, striking her below the ear. She pulls the knife out, throws one at Heathcliff and runs out of the house, looking back to see Heathcliff and Hindley fighting. She came then to the Grange, and leaves after changing clothes and telling Ellen the story. Isabella goes to the south near London, and there has a son whom she names Linton and who is quite sickly.

Time heals some of his wounds, and he finds comfort in his daughter, who has been named Catherine. Hindley dies about six months after Catherine. The doctor tells Ellen that he died as he lived, drunk. Ellen goes to the lawyer and to Wuthering Heights to see about the funeral.

Heathcliff tries to get Catherine and Linton to walk about, but Linton says that he wants to stay inside, and so Cathy and Hareton walk out. Linton soon gets jealous though, and he joins them, turning the conversation over to making fun of Hareton and his lack of education.

",Wuthering Heights
209," Macbeth: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 1-Act 1, Scene 2","Act 1, Scene 1: The three infamous witches of Macbeth make their first appearance as they make convoluted conversation with each other amidst terrifying thunder and lightning.  The ""weird"" sisters agree to reconvene once ""the battle's lost and won"" upon ""the heath."" (Act 1, Scene 1, Lines 4 7) The details of this battle are unknown until the later scenes in this act of the play.
Act 1, Scene 2: King Duncan, his sons Malcolm and Donalbain and the nobleman Lennox meet with a bleeding captain who recounts the details of the aforementioned battle.  Malcolm bids the captain, who valiantly fought in the battle, to tell the king the present state of affairs.  He says that the rebel Macdonwald swarmed the battlefield with his men, who claimed nativity from far-off places like the Western Isles.  Although fate seemed to be with Macdonwald, Macbeth boldly made his way to the ""rebel,"" split him from the navel to the jaws and hung his head over the battlefield.  King Duncan praises Macbeth's courage and encourages the captain to continue with his narration.  He says that just when the turn of events seemed favorable for Scotland, the Norwegian lord began a fresh assault with more men and supplies.  Macbeth and Banquo, undeterred from their mission, continued to fight with ardor.
	At this point, the captain reels from weakness and the king orders surgeons to attend to him.  Ross and Angus, Scottish noblemen, hasten into the courtroom with a wild look in their eyes.  Ross tells King Duncan that the traitorous Thane of Cawdor assisted the King of Norway in the battle.  The title ""thane"" indicates a Scottish nobleman.  He also tells the king, however, that after much bloody fight the victory fell to Scotland.  Duncan prepares to make peace with Sweno, Norway's king and asks for ten thousand dollars from him in return for the proper burial of his men.  In addition, King Duncan orders the immediate execution of the Thane of Cawdor and asks that Ross greet Macbeth with the news that he will be the new Thane of Cawdor.  Duncan says, ""What he [former Thane of Cawdor] hath lost, Macbeth hath won."" (Act 1, Scene 2, Line 66) Thus, the king has fulfilled part of the witches' prophecy-""when the battle's lost and won."" Furthermore, the fact that Macbeth defies fate in fighting Macdonwald indicates his propensity to twist the present to alter a supposedly fixed future.  It is this courage to play with fate that made Macbeth murder his countless victims based on the advice of the witches.
",Macbeth
210,"Macbeth: Novel Summary: Act 1, Scene 3-Act 1, Scene 4","Act 1, Scene 3: Now that the witches' prophecy has been realized, they reconvene at the predetermined heath.  The first witch explains to the others why she was late in coming.  Angered at the impudence of a sailor's wife in not giving her chestnuts, the first witch vows to seek revenge on the sailor, making him a sleepless, cursed man.  It is important to note here that the witch (and thus Shakespeare and the audience) associates sleeplessness with an evil or cursed life.  Macbeth, after killing King Duncan, can hardly sleep because of his ghastly nightmares.  While the witches are talking, Macbeth and Banquo enter the area.  Macbeth proclaims that he has never seen a day ""so fair and foul."" (Act 1, Scene 3, Line 38) This is reminiscent of the weird sisters' statement in Act 1, Scene 1 that ""fair is foul and foul is fair."" This is a prominent theme in the play, as it beautifully expresses the macabre state of affairs within Macbeth and without.  Banquo, after seeing the witches, becomes horrified by their hideous appearances.
	Macbeth, however, ignores the physical aspects of the sorceresses and asks them to speak.  Each witch addresses him in a different manner-one as the Thane of Glamis, the second as the Thane of Cawdor and the third as ""that shalt be king hereafter."" (Act 1, Scene 3, Line 50) After hearing these strange prophecies, Macbeth remains in a sort of ecstatic stupor while Banquo asks the witches to look into his future.  The weird sisters say that while Banquo himself will not be as happy or lucky as Macbeth will, he will be much more fortunate in the long run.  Also, they tell him that he will beget a line of kings even though he will never be a monarch himself.  Awakened from his stupor, Macbeth asks the witches how it can be possible that he will be the Thane of Cawdor, when to his knowledge, the nobleman still lives.  He also asks them from whence they get their knowledge of the future.  Suddenly, the weird sisters disappear into thin air, much to the surprise of Banquo and Macbeth.
	Ross and Angus, sent by King Duncan, meet up with the pair at this time.  Ross tells Macbeth that in return for his brave combat, Duncan bestows upon him the title of the Thane of Cawdor.  Angus explains that the current Thane of Cawdor will be executed for his treachery.  Both Macbeth and Banquo are stunned to realize that the witches' first prophecy has actually come to pass. Banquo, however, tells Macbeth that oftentimes the prophecies of such evil creatures come with heavy consequences.  It is important to note here that while Banquo quickly realized the truly ""foul"" nature of the witches, Macbeth still considered them as ""fair."" While Banquo talks to Angus and Ross, Macbeth engages in profound thought.  He cannot determine whether the prophecies are good or evil.  If the sayings are evil, he says, then it is strange that he has achieved so much success by them already.  If the predictions are good, however, then he wonders why he is so frightened by the sudden thought that has just occurred to him.  Macbeth has just considered killing King Duncan in order to shorten the interim period between the present and the realization of the last prophecy.  At the same time, however, Macbeth concedes that he could also just let fate run its course.  Macbeth urges Banquo to carefully analyze the night's strange incidents so that they can talk about them in detail later.  The group then leaves the heath and travels towards the residence of the king.
	Act 1, Scene 4: At the palace, King Duncan asks Malcolm if the Thane of Cawdor's execution has taken place.  Malcolm tells him that the nobleman repented his actions.  In response, Duncan says that there is no way of determining a person's thoughts, whether good or evil, in the physiognomy of the face.  The king says that the Thane of Cawdor betrayed him although he had absolutely trusted him.  This is ironic because in the same way Macbeth plots to kill Duncan albeit with a sweet and servile countenance.  At this point, Macbeth enters and Duncan laments that he can never amply recompense him for all of his work.  Macbeth replies that his work for the king is a reward in itself.  The king also highly praises Banquo.  Then, in front of the entire assembly, King Duncan proclaims his son Malcolm to be his heir to the crown.  Macbeth asks to take leave of the king so that he can write a letter to his wife telling her about the turn of events in the castle.  He also determines that he must kill Duncan and Malcolm if he wants to be king; in the space of a scene, his mind is firmly resolved to commit the crime.

Act 1, Scene 6: King Duncan and Banquo enter Inverness and admire its beauty and advantageous situation.  Lady Macbeth and King Duncan cordially greet each other, and Duncan informs her of his plan to stay overnight.  With all of the hospitality of a good host, Lady Macbeth encourages everyone to make themselves at home.

Lady Macbeth enters the room and asks Macbeth why he is not dining with Duncan.  Macbeth tells his wife that he does not want to proceed with their plans.  She furiously asks Macbeth why he is so afraid to be the same in action as he is in desire.  In addition, she declares him a sickly coward. She assures her husband that they will not fail in their mission.  Lady Macbeth explains that they will poison King Duncan and his servants' wine with sleeping pills and that Macbeth will murder Duncan in his sleep.  Finally convinced by his wife, he agrees to carry through with the plans with the semblance of an amicable host.
	Act 2, Scene 1: Banquo and his son Fleance walk toward their rooms after all of the merrymaking is over.  Banquo tells Fleance that he is unable to sleep because of his troubling thoughts.  He is wondering if Macbeth will take fate into his own hands to try and realize the witches' prophecies.  The pair meets up with Macbeth, who is also roaming the hallways.  Banquo tells Macbeth of King Duncan's pleasure at having been so royally treated.  He asks Macbeth if he has been thinking of the weird sisters; Macbeth falsely responds in the negative.  Again, he asks Banquo to talk with him at a later date about the strange events of that night.  It seems that Macbeth seeks an intelligent and compassionate friend like Banquo to be his confidante in crime.  Macbeth summons his wife and suddenly finds himself clutching a dagger, which stuns him.  He sees imaginary drops of blood on the dagger that he will use to kill Duncan.

(Act 2, Scene 2, Lines 34-5) From this point on in the play, neither Macbeth nor his wife are able to have a good night's rest as they are plagued by the memories of their ghastly crime.
Suddenly, Lady Macbeth notices that her husband's hands are covered in blood and that he is still clutching the telltale dagger.  She orders him to wash up and hide all incriminating evidence.  Macbeth, however, is incapable of doing anything because he is in a state of shock, so Lady Macbeth is forced to take over.  She smears blood over the faces of Duncan's servants so that they will seem guilty of the crime.  When she returns, she promptly washes her hands and orders Macbeth to be calm.  The couple hears a loud knocking at the south entry and they fearfully retire to their chambers.

223,Ivanhoe: Summary,"Chapter I
	The story is set in England in the twelfth century, towards the end of the reign of Richard I. Richard is absent from the country. He has been imprisoned in Austria on his return from the Crusades in the Holy Land. In his absence, the nobles have established a tyranny, and the lower classes suffer under it. This situation arose as a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Although four generations have passed since then, there is still hostility between the Normans, who were originally from France, and the conquered population of Anglo-Saxons.
	It is an early evening in summer in a forest in the area of northern England known as the West Riding of Yorkshire. Gurth, the swine-herd, is talking to Wamba, the jester. Both are in the employ of Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon noble. Gurth appeals to Wamba to help him round up the herd, but Wamba is reluctant. Wamba then makes a series of pointed jokes at the expense of the Normans, whom they both dislike. Gurth then complains that the Normans take the best of everything, although Cedric has been valiant in the preservation of Saxon rights. But he fears the imminent visit of a Norman noble, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
	Chapter II
	A group of ten horsemen overtake Wamba and Gurth on the road. The two most important men in this group are an easy-going, generous-minded monk, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and a stern knight of the order of the Knights Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who has been fighting in the Holy Land. The other men are their attendants. The prior and the knight ask Gurth and Wamba the way to Cedric the Saxon’s home, where they desire to stay the night. Gurth is reluctant to give these Normans directions to his master’s dwelling, and he quarrels with the knight. The prior intervenes to keep the peace. Then Wamba gives the men the wrong directions. But when the men reach the place called Sunken Cross, where Wamba told them to turn left, they cannot remember what the directions were. They stop a stranger, who says he is also going to Cedric’s. The stranger, who says he is a palmer (pilgrim) just returned from the Holy Land, then leads them in the right direction until they arrive at Cedric’s mansion.
	Chapter III
	In Cedric’s mansion, the hall is prepared for the evening meal. Cedric sits at his table on a raised dais, waiting for the dinner, which has been delayed, to be served. Several servants stand behind him, and his dogs are at his feet. Cedric is anxious because Gurth has not returned with the herd, and he fears that some misfortune has befallen them, although he is more worried about the herd (which is valuable) than about Gurth. He is also impatient for his favorite clown, Wamba. When Oswald, his cup-bearer, says that Gurth is not that late, since the curfew bell only tolled an hour ago, Cedric is put in an even worse temper. This is because the curfew is a Norman imposition. Cedric rants about all the injustices that accompany Norman rule, and he also mentions his son that he banished. Then the sound of the Knight Templar’s horn outside interrupts him. Cedric is none too pleased to hear who the visitors are, because both are Normans, but he wishes to show hospitality nonetheless. The guests are shown in.
	Chapter IV
	Cedric greets his hosts with dignity, although there is some tension between the Saxon Cedric and his Norman guests. Wamba and Gurth return, to Cedric’s complaints about how tardy they are. The feast is a fine one, and the diners are joined by Cedric’s beautiful young ward, the Lady Rowena. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar, is captivated by her and stares at her, which displeases both Rowena and Cedric. In the discussion over dinner, it transpires that the Knight and Prior are on their way to a tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Another stranger arrives at the gate, and Cedric authorizes his page to allow him to stay the night.
The opening chapters introduce a number of the themes of the novel and show the situations of many of the main characters. Chapter I makes is clear how divided the country is between Normans and Saxons, and how the Norman nobles have established a tyranny. In this theme the author, Sir Walter Scott, is not being true to history. Scholars of the period agree that any hostility between Norman and Saxon did not last for four generations after the Norman Conquest. In those days, people were more conscious of divisions of rank than of national origin. Scott’s picture of Saxons and Normans in fact represents more the typical nineteenth century view of the good-hearted, rough-and-ready English and the foppish, pretentious French. Hostility between England and France was a habit acquired over several centuries of frequent wars between the two countries. (The war in which the English defeated Napoleon was fresh in the minds of the first readers of Ivanhoe, which was published only a few years after Napoleon’s final defeat.)
	The lines of conflict that are to dominate the novel are clearly drawn in the opening chapters. Cedric’s disinheritance of his son is mentioned, and this father-son drama will become an important element in the plot. Lady Rowena is introduced, and as a beautiful young unmarried woman she is clearly going to be the subject of a romantic plot, although De Bois-Guilbert’s early interest in her does prove to be something of a red herring.
	The Norman villain of the novel is also introduced in these early chapters. De Bois-Guilbert is presented as an arrogant, quarrelsome knight, as his treatment of Gurth in Chapter II shows. His susceptibility to women, later to become one of the main plot elements, is also shown. It runs counter to the vow of chastity he took as a member of the Knight Templar Order.
	Just as the representatives of medieval chivalry do not emerge as admirable characters, neither do the representatives of the medieval church. One such representative is introduced in these chapters. The initial description of the Prior tells its own tale. His clothes are much finer than the rules of his Cistercian order permit—a sign of his hypocrisy. The fact that he is overweight, not to mention the twinkle in his eye, indicates that he enjoys the pleasures of eating and drinking.

224,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"Summary
	Act 1, scene 1
	Two gentlemen are talking in the palace of Cymbeline, King of Britain. The First Gentleman says that all the courtiers are frowning, reflecting the sorrowful mood of the King. He explains the reason: the King's daughter, Imogen, has married Posthumus Leonatus, a poor but worthy man, against the wishes of her father and his current wife, the Queen. The King has banished Posthumus and imprisoned Imogen. The King and Queen had wanted Imogen to marry Cloten, the Queen's son by a previous husband.
	The First Gentleman says that despite their sad appearance, the courtiers are secretly glad about the marriage, as Cloten is ""too bad for bad report"" (line 17). In contrast, he says Imogen's chosen husband is both outwardly handsome and inwardly good. He is the son of Sicilius, who won military glory fighting for King Cymbeline's father, Tenantius, against the Romans. Sicilius earned the surname Leonatus (lion's whelp) for his bravery. Besides Posthumus, Sicilius also had two other sons, who died in battle, ""with their swords in hand"" (line 36), whereupon Sicilius died of grief. Sicilius' wife was pregnant and died giving birth to Posthumus.
	Since Posthumus was now an orphan, the King took him under his care and brought him up. Posthumus grew to be loved and respected in the court. The First Gentleman says that his virtue is demonstrated by the fact that Imogen, the King's daughter and heir, has chosen him. Imogen is the King's only child. He once had two sons, but twenty years ago, both were stolen from the nursery when the eldest was three and the youngest a baby. The Second Gentleman is surprised that the King's children were so poorly guarded, and the search so slow that it could not trace them.
	The gentlemen end their talk as the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen enter.
	Analysis
	Little is known about the historical Cymbeline, son of Theomantius (Shakespeare calls him Tenantius). He became King of Britain in 33 BC, when it was an outpost of the Roman empire. He reigned for 35 years, leaving two sons, Guiderius and Arvigarus. He was brought up in Rome and was absolved by Augustus Caesar of paying tribute. Subsequently, tribute was demanded and refused, but the chronicler Holinshed, one of Shakespeare's main sources, is unsure whether Cymbeline or some other King refused to pay. Caesar then invaded Britain. Holinshed wrote that British chroniclers claim the Romans were twice defeated in battle, but comments that Latin sources claimed ultimate victory for the Romans. Shakespeare, for the purposes of his play, has Cymbeline refuse to pay the tribute.
	The play's first scene is an expository one in that it gives the background to the story and tells us something about the main characters. It sets up a stark contrast between Imogen's two suitors: the Queen's son Cloten, an unworthy man, and the King's ward, Posthumus, as virtuous as he is attractive.
	It also introduces two major themes of the play. The first is outward appearance (the courtiers' sad faces) versus inward truth (their happiness at Imogen's marriage to Posthumus). At court, the two are at odds, leading to a hypocritical atmosphere. Related to this theme is outward nobility of birth (which Cloten has), which is not earned and which can be superficial, versus inward nobility of character (which Posthumus has), which must be earned and runs deep. Imogen, who is both well-born and appreciates true goodness, unites both. However, in her decision to marry the poor but worthy Posthumus, she has initiated a conflict with her parents, who are unable to see beyond his undistinguished birth.
	The disappearance of the King's sons carries intense symbolic importance. The Romance tradition of literature often featured a king who was wounded or disabled in some way. When the king, the symbolic head of a nation, was sick, his country was sick too: crops failed, disease and famine thrived. The hero of the story went on a quest to find the regenerative ""cure"" for the king's ailment and, by extension, his country. In this tradition, to which all Shakespeare's Romance plays (A Winter's Tale, The Tempest, Pericles and Cymbeline) belong, the cure is often found by someone from the younger generation, which represents regeneration, fertility, and vigorous new life.
	In Cymbeline, the fact that the King has lost his sons leaves him cut off from this life-giving quality. Only Imogen is left of the younger generation, but the King has rejected her. Severed from the regenerative root, the King and his court are left to wither and decay in destructive emotions like resentment and revenge. Through reference to the Romance tradition, we expect that Cymbeline's cure will involve being reunited with his sons and reconciled with Imogen.
",Cymbeline
225,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Summary
	The Queen tells Imogen that she is no wicked stepmother in that she supports her in her decision. She will have Imogen set free and speak in favor of Posthumus to the King. But she advises Posthumus to comply with the King's sentence of banishment. Posthumus agrees to leave today. The Queen leaves the newly-wed couple alone ""in pity"" of their state, in spite of the King's orders that they should not speak together.
	Imogen tells Posthumus that the Queen is only pretending to be on their side. She has braced herself to stay and face her father's anger, and sorrowfully urges Posthumus to leave. Posthumus, moved by Imogen's grief, pledges his loyalty to her. He will go to Rome and stay with his father's friend Philario.
	The Queen re-enters and advises the couple to be brief as she is at risk of angering the King. In a sinister aside to the audience, she reveals that she is sure of winning the King over to her way of thinking, since he always submits to the wrongs she does him in order to keep her friendship.
	Left alone with Posthumus, Imogen gives him a diamond ring, which belonged to her mother. She asks him to keep it until he woos another wife, after she herself is dead. He protests that he only wants one wife - Imogen - and that he would die sooner than take another. He puts the ring on her finger and also gives her a bracelet to wear for his sake.
	As Imogen wonders when they will meet again, Cymbeline comes in, furious to see Posthumus still there. Posthumus leaves with a blessing on ""the good remainders of the court"" (line 60). The King then charges Imogen with disloyalty, but Imogen advises him not to harm himself with his wrath; she is senseless of it, since parting from her husband is a greater pain. He accuses her of bringing ""baseness"" on his throne by taking a ""beggar"" for her husband; she insists that she has added ""lustre"" to it (line 74). She points out that it is Cymbeline's fault that she loves Posthumus, as Cymbeline brought them up together, and adds that Posthumus is ""a man worth any woman"" (line 77).
	As the Queen enters, Cymbeline scolds her for disobeying his command and allowing the couple to meet. The Queen asks the King to leave her with them, which he does.
	Pisanio, Posthumus's servant, comes in and tells the Queen that her son Cloten has drawn his sword on Posthumus. Posthumus was not incited to anger and did not try to hurt Cloten; others parted them. Imogen wishes they had been in some lonely place and that the fight had been concluded, presumably with the destruction of Cloten. Posthumus has sent Pisanio back to serve Imogen. Imogen asks him to come and see her in half an hour's time.
	Analysis
	The King is consumed by anger that his ambitions for his daughter have been thwarted, and the Queen is engaged in scheming for her own selfish ends. It is left to the young couple, Imogen and Posthumus, to act from a basis of love and selflessness. Our sympathies are with them, and this is reinforced by Posthumus's generous treatment of Cloten, whom he avoids harming in a fight even though Cloten was the aggressor.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is developed further. Imogen refers to the Queen's ""dissembling courtesy"" (line 15), as she sees that the Queen is really self-serving underneath her pretended support for the newly-wed couple. The Queen reveals her hypocritical nature in an aside which tells the audience that she plays upon the King's emotions for her own ends (lines 35-7).
	The contrast between outward rank and inward worth is brought home in Cymbeline's accusation that Posthumus is a base ""beggar"" since he is low-born, whereas Imogen protests his true worth.
	It is worth noting in this scene that Imogen wishes that she were a goatherd's daughter, and Posthumus a shepherd's son. The theme of the innocence and purity of the countryside and its dwellers contrasted with the corruption of the court is a traditional one of Romance plays.

	The First Lord advises Cloten to change his shirt, which smells as a result of his fighting with Posthumus, though the Lord, in an attempt to flatter Cloten, tries unconvincingly to suggest that it is the air outside Cloten's shirt that is unwholesome. Cloten only sees the need to change his shirt if it were bloody, and asks if Posthumus is hurt. The Second Lord reveals in an aside to the audience that he is not, but the First Lord tries to flatter Cloten by saying it would be remarkable if Posthumus were not hurt. The Second Lord continues to address the audience in asides revealing Cloten's cowardice and Posthumus's bravery in the fight. Cloten claims he wishes the onlookers had not parted them, and the Second Lord says in an aside that he wishes Posthumus had killed Cloten.
	Cloten is astonished that Imogen could prefer Posthumus to himself. The First lord replies that her beauty exceeds her intelligence.
	Analysis
	The Second Lord echoes Imogen's wish in the previous scene that Posthumus had killed Cloten. This sets up an expectation that Cloten may indeed be disposed of. The contrast between the First Lord's flattering remarks to Cloten and the Second Lord's contempt for him, expressed in asides to the audience, reveal the hypocrisy and underlying discontent at court, where people say one thing but think another. Such disunity in Shakespeare indicates an unsustainable situation, since if truth is to prevail, that which is false must be destroyed.
	Cloten's vanity and lack of self-knowledge are plain in this, our first sight of him. Cloten speaks in prose, revealing his unrefined nature, whereas Imogen and Posthumus address each other in blank verse, as befits their more refined characters. Cloten also smells bad, which in Shakespeare is a sure sign of an uncivilized nature.

227,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 4,"Summary
	Imogen questions Pisanio about his last sight of Posthumus and hopes he will write. Posthumus's final words were about Imogen as he unwillingly sailed away from her. Imogen regrets that she did not have time to say all that she had wanted to her husband - her worries that Posthumus would be tempted away from her by Italian women, and her desire that he should think of her at certain pre-arranged time - before Cymbeline came in and interrupted them.
	A lady enters and tells Imogen that the Queen wishes to see her.
	Analysis
	The love between the young couple is reinforced by Pisanio's account of Posthumus's actions on leaving.
	The language of the seasons and nature's cycles runs through all the Romance plays. Here, Imogen likens her father's interruption of her meeting with Posthumus to the ""tyrannous breathing of the north"" that ""shakes all our buds from growing"" (lines 36-7). The young lovers embody the regenerative and life-giving warm spring season (the previous scene, Act 1, scene 3, line 31, already implied that Imogen was like the sun), whereas Cymbeline represents the chill north wind that prevents the growth of their love.
",Cymbeline
228,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 5,"Summary
	The scene is set in Rome at the house of Philario, where Posthumus intends to stay. Iachimo, a friend of Philario's, is speaking cynically about Posthumus, whom he has seen on a trip to Britain. He hints that he may not be as worthy as he is popularly believed to be. Philario replies that Posthumus has since grown in worth ""both without and within"" (line 10). Iachimo suggests that his marriage to the King's daughter gives him a reputation he does not deserve, and that people would rather exaggerate Posthumus's goodness than question Imogen's judgment for ""taking a beggar"" (line 24). He asks Philario why Posthumus is staying with him. Philario explains that he and Posthumus's father Sicilius were soldiers together, and that Sicilius saved his life.
	Posthumus arrives and Philario introduces him to the others present-Iachimo, a Frenchman and a Dutchman. The Frenchman reminds Posthumus that he has met him before, at Orleans, where he made peace between Posthumus and another Frenchman when they were about to fight over a trivial matter. Posthumus protests that the matter was not trivial. Iachimo inquires what it was, and the Frenchman explains that Posthumus had maintained that his lover, Imogen, was more beautiful, chaste and virtuous than any woman in France. Iachimo sneers that either the lady or Posthumus's opinion must not still exist. Posthumus protests that both her virtue and his opinion hold. Iachimo extends the quarrel, saying Posthumus cannot set her above Italian women. Posthumus will not give ground.
	Iachimo introduces a comparison between Posthumus's wife and his diamond. It may be, he says, that the diamond outshines many others that he has seen, but he has not seen the most precious diamond in existence, and neither has Posthumus seen the best woman in existence. When Posthumus says he values his diamond as more precious than any other, Iachimo wrongly implies that he prizes his diamond above Imogen. But Posthumus sets him right, pointing out that Imogen cannot be bought or sold, and is ""only the gift of the gods"" (line 88). Iachimo suggests that of Posthumus's two priceless things, the diamond ring and Imogen, the one could be stolen and the second is ""frail"" (line 94); both are vulnerable to thieves. Posthumus replies that Italy contains no courtier accomplished enough to convince Imogen to betray him, and neither does he fear the loss of his ring.
	Iachimo issues a challenge to Posthumus: he says he could get the better of Imogen's-or any woman's-virtue ""even to the yielding,"" an expression that implies sexual as well as military surrender. He wagers half his estate against Posthumus's ring that he will prevail. Posthumus refuses, saying that Iachimo deserves punishment.
	Philario intervenes, asking them to forget their disagreement. Iachimo now wishes he had extended his wager to include his neighbor's estate. He suggests a bet of ten thousand ducats against Posthumus's ring that, given an introduction to the court where Imogen lives, he will defeat her honor and bring back proof. Posthumus agrees to the wager with the addition that if Iachimo prevails, he will not treat him as an enemy, since Imogen will not be worth the debate. But if Imogen refuses to be seduced, then for the insult Iachimo has offered to her chastity, Posthumus will fight him. Iachimo agrees and says they will have a legal agreement drawn up.
	Analysis
	Philario says he is happy to let Posthumus's true worth speak for itself, rather than praise him unnecessarily: such is his confidence in the reality of his goodness. In Posthumus's case, there is no difference between appearance and reality.
	Iachimo, in contrast, who cynically judges all men by his own debased standards, tries to suggest that Posthumus's reputation is not deserved and that he borrows any perceived worth from his marriage with the King's daughter. His attitude is a veiled warning that he will try to prove his mean estimation of Posthumus to be true-that he will attempt to bring him down to his own base level.
	Iachimo's military metaphors are worth noting. He says that popular praise of Posthumus is calculated to ""fortify"" Imogen's questionable judgment, which is so weak it would fall before an ""easy battery"" (lines 21-3). He is confident that his conversation could ""get ground of"" Imogen (line 108) and make her yield-military terms for driving an enemy into retreat and making them surrender. This says much about his world view: to him, good people are enemies to be vanquished.
	Iachimo's skill in making mischief is clearly portrayed in this scene. On hearing that Posthumus was previously willing to fight to defend his lady's virtue, he realizes that this is a sensitive area where Posthumus is vulnerable to attack. He quickly divines the things that are most precious to Posthumus (Imogen and the diamond she has given him), and attempts to equate the two by suggesting that Imogen can be stolen as easily as the diamond.
	This scene makes use of images of buying, selling, and worth, a major theme in the play. The cynical Iachimo implies (line 15) that as a poor man, Posthumus's worth is only borrowed from the King's daughter, that he is ""weighed rather by her value than his own."" Also, Posthumus and Iachimo discuss in detail what Imogen, and Posthumus's diamond, are worth.

229,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 6,"Summary
	At Cymbeline's palace, the Queen is giving instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground. Then she asks the doctor, Cornelius, whether he has brought the drugs. He presents a box to her, but his conscience prompts him to ask why she requires these slow but deadly poisons. Annoyed at being questioned, she replies that while the doctor has trained her in the herbal arts of distilling and making perfumes, she wants to extend her skill by testing these compounds on non-human subjects - by implication, animals. Cornelius is not impressed, and points out that she will only harden her heart.
	The Queen ends the conversation abruptly and Pisanio enters. In an aside, the Queen reveals her intention to try her poisons first on him, as he is on Posthumus's side and an ""enemy"" to her son in the question of Imogen. As she dismisses Cornelius, he remarks in an aside that he knows of her malice, and will ensure that she does no harm. The drugs he has given her are not the deadly poisons she requested, but potions to ""stupefy and dull the sense awhile."" She will try them on cats and dogs, and later humans, but the effect will be merely to lock up the spirits temporarily, only for the subject to awaken refreshed.
	The Queen hopes Imogen's affections for Posthumus will cool. She promises Pisanio that when he brings her word that Imogen loves Cloten, she will make him as great as his master, Posthumus. In fact, he will be greater, as Posthumus cannot return; neither can Posthumus provide for Pisanio.
	The Queen then drops the box, and Pisanio picks it up. The Queen urges him to take it as a token of further favors she intends to him, claiming she has five times saved the King's life with its contents. She orders Pisanio to tell Imogen what she must do (presumably, to renounce Posthumus and marry Cloten). She reminds him that if he brings about her desire, he will still have his mistress, Imogen, and Cloten also to give him preferment. In addition, she will persuade the King to grant whatever he wishes, and she herself will be obligated to reward him.
	Pisanio leaves without responding, and the Queen reveals that she mistrusts him, as she believes he is still loyal to Posthumus and Imogen. She says if he takes what she believes to be poison, Imogen will have no supporters. If Imogen continues to defy the Queen, she too will be given poison, leaving Cloten as heir to Cymbeline's throne. Pisanio re-enters to reveal to the audience that he would rather choke himself than prove untrue to Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The Queen's instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground has sinister significance. Belarius, at Act 4, scene 2, lines 284-5, comments that ""The herbs that have on them cold dew o'th'night / Are strewings fitt'st for graves."" Herbalists advised that medicinal herbs should be picked when dried by the sun, since dewy herbs would rot quickly and would therefore be less wholesome and unsuitable for healing. The Queen, obsessed with poisoning people who stand in her way, wants to put the flowers to an evil use, which stands in contrast to the life-affirming floral imagery surrounding the young lovers. This is part of the play's theme of the regenerative role of the younger generation contrasted with the destructive and decaying role of the older generation.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is presented with a twist in the doctor's determination to be true to mankind in general by being false with the Queen: by his lie about the effects of the herbs he has given her, he will save her intended victims from poison.
	The Queen's treachery and deceit is contrasted with the loyalty and integrity of Pisanio and Cornelius.

230,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 7,"Summary
	Imogen is lamenting her unhappy situation, and wishes she had been stolen like her brothers. Pisanio enters with Iachimo, introducing him as a gentleman from Rome who has brought letters from Posthumus, who is safe. In an aside, Iachimo praises Imogen's beauty and admits that if her mind is as admirable, he has lost his wager.
	Posthumus, in his letter, asks Imogen to treat Iachimo well in return for his ""kindnesses"" to Posthumus (line 23). She welcomes him. Iachimo appears to be wonder-struck by Imogen's beauty, and muses aloud how anyone could fail to distinguish between fair and foul. He seems to imply, without actually saying it outright, that there is another woman whom, in spite of her obvious inferiority (""sluttery,"" line 44), Posthumus is driven by lust to prefer to Imogen.
	Imogen is mystified but changes the subject, asking after Posthumus's health and state of mind. Iachimo takes his chance to blacken Posthumus's character further, saying he is so merry that he is called ""the Briton reveller"". Imogen says he is more usually inclined to sadness; Iachimo replies that he has never seen Posthumus sad. On the contrary, he says, he laughs at a Frenchman who is pining after his girlfriend at home, for wasting time in such ""bondage."" He suggests that Posthumus is abusing his God-given bounty (both his own talents and his wife), and says he pities them. Posthumus neglects his ""sun"" (Imogen) and takes solace in a dungeon by the light of a burned-out candle, a a reference, perhaps, to a sordid and secretive place or to the worn-out slut whom he alleges Posthumus meets there.
	Imogen asks Iachimo to speak more openly, as she would rather know the truth. Iachimo protests that if he had a woman such as Imogen, he would never pursue common prostitutes. Imogen is worried, saying that her husband ""has forgot Britain"" (line 113). Iachimo says Posthumus is forcing her to live a nun-like life while he is living a sexually promiscuous life on her money. He urges her to revenge and dedicates himself to her ""sweet pleasure"" (line 136), saying that unlike Posthumus, he will be loyal to her.
	He tries to kiss Imogen, but this action prompts her to see Iachimo for what he is. She calls for Pisanio, and rejects Iachimo's advance, reproaching herself for listening to him. His motivation, she says, was not virtuous but self-seeking, to obtain her for himself. She says he has wronged Posthumus and that she will tell her father of his assault.
	Iachimo rapidly changes direction, protesting that his aim was only to test her loyalty to Posthumus, and that he did so out of love to him. He begs her to forgive him, which she does.
	Iachimo then asks Imogen to store a trunk containing expensive plate and jewels which he, Posthumus and some other friends have jointly bought as a gift for the Roman Emperor. She agrees, and as Posthumus has an interest in them, says she will keep them in her bedroom. Iachimo says he will have them sent to her just for tonight, as he must leave tomorrow. She tries to persuade Iachimo to stay, but he cannot. He suggests that she write Posthumus a letter tonight so that he can return with it tomorrow.
	Analysis
	Iachimo's base nature is displayed in his use of animal imagery (lines 39-50). Apes, he says, would discriminate better than Posthumus does between Imogen and the imaginary ""slut."" He likens Posthumus to a predator which devours first the lamb (Imogen) but, still hungry, wants to feed on ""garbage.""
	Iachimo's description of Posthumus in exile as ""the Briton reveler"" is calculated to upset Imogen and make her suspicious of her husband's loyalty. He uses images of rot, decay, disease and poison to excite disgust at Posthumus's supposed life of whoring: ""Such boil'd stuff / As well might poison poison!"" (line 126) is thought to refer to the sweating treatment given to people suffering from venereal disease. Note that he also tries to set Imogen against Posthumus by accusing Posthumus of going whoring on her money, a continuation the theme of buying and selling.
	Iachimo's dedication of himself to Imogen's ""sweet pleasure"" may be taken to mean he will do what she wishes by way of helping her take revenge, or may be a seduction attempt. Probably, it carries both meanings. His mind constantly runs along animalistic and sexual tracks, debasing the love relationship between Posthumus and Imogen.
	The rapidity with which Iachimo changes track once Imogen sees through him, and appeals to her naturally open nature, indicates his great skill in manipulating people. Imogen's willingness to forgive Iachimo contrasts markedly with her father's failure to forgive her for marrying against his wishes.

	Cloten is playing bowls with some Lords and losing. A Lord asks Cloten if he knows of the Italian visitor to court, Iachimo, a friend of Posthumus's. Cloten does not, and goes to seek him out. The Second Lord, left alone, marvels ""That such a crafty devil as is his mother / Should yield the world this ass!"" (lines 54-5). She is a woman who ""Bears all down with her brain,"" whereas Cloten cannot take two from twenty. The Lord pities Imogen for her unhappy position between her father ruled by her stepmother, the stepmother ""hourly coining plots"" (line 61), and a hateful suitor who wants to divorce her from her husband. He prays that Imogen holds firm.
	Analysis
	This scene adds little to the action of the play, and much of the dialogue is of poor quality, leading some critics to suspect that it is not Shakespeare's but has been interpolated by an unknown hand. Its main function seems to be to further expose Cloten's unrefined nature, to compare his stupidity with his mother's cunning, and to establish that he did not know of Iachimo's presence at court.

	The scene is set in Imogen's bedroom. Iachimo's trunk is placed in it. After she goes to sleep, Iachimo emerges from the trunk. He is tempted by her beauty, but resists the urge to touch and kiss her. His plan is to note details of the room and identifying marks on her body, in order to convince Posthumus that he has succeeded in seducing her. He removes her bracelet, the parting gift from her husband, which he says will help in the ""madding"" of Posthumus (line 37). He also notes a mole on her left breast. When he feels he has enough evidence, he gets back into the trunk.
	Analysis
	The atmosphere of sexual menace in this scene is palpable. Iachimo, leaning over the sleeping and defenseless Imogen and noting the intimate details of her body, is committing a kind of rape, a psychological violation of the marriage between her and Posthumus. This notion is reinforced by the book she has been reading (probably Ovid's Metamorphoses), which tells of treason and rape. Iachimo appears to liken himself to a raven (line 49), a continuation of the predator and prey imagery that runs through the play. His line ""Though this is a heavenly angel, hell is here"" (line 50) leaves no doubt as to the depraved state of Iachimo's soul as compared with that of Imogen.

	Cloten is playing some Lords, either at dice or cards, and losing again. Some musicians enter; Cloten has employed them to serenade Imogen, which they do.
	The King and Queen enter. Cymbeline inquires whether Imogen has come out of her room. When Cloten says she has not, Cymbeline says that in time, Imogen will forget Posthumus and then she will be Cloten's. The Queen advises him to obey Imogen in everything except when she sends him away.
	A messenger announces that some ambassadors from Rome, including one called Lucius, have arrived. Cymbeline knows that Rome is angry with him, but he will receive Lucius, who is a worthy man, according to the honor of the Emperor. He asks Cloten to greet Imogen and then to follow him and the Queen to meet the Roman.
	Cloten, left alone, plans to bribe one of Imogen's ladies to buy access to her. Gold can do anything, he says, even have an honest man killed and save a thief.
	He knocks at Imogen's door. A Lady emerges, and Cloten offers her gold to speak for him. Imogen enters. She tells Cloten that she does not care for him, and indeed, she hates him. Cloten says she owes her father obedience. Because of her royal status, she does not have free choice and cannot marry a ""base slave."" Imogen angrily defends her husband, saying that Cloten, even if he were the god Jupiter's son, would be ""too base / To be his groom"" (lines 127-8).
	Imogen calls Pisanio and send him to ask one of her ladies to search for her bracelet. She is sure that she had it last night, because she kissed it.
	Cloten is offended by Imogen's statement that Posthumus's ""meanest garment"" is dearer to her than Cloten, and threatens to tell her father. Imogen suggests he tell the Queen too, and is in no doubt that she will think the worst of her. Cloten vows revenge.
	Analysis
	Cloten employs lewd imagery when talking of Imogen (lines 14-15): ""penetrate,"" ""fingering"" and ""try with tongue too"" are ostensibly about music but have sexual double meanings. The delicate song that follows Cloten's lewd speech, ""Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings, / And Phoebus gins arise,"" reflects the split between the superficially civilized surface and the brutally vulgar. The inappropriateness of Cloten's attitude to Imogen is underscored by his own reference to her ladies as ""Diana's rangers"" (line 70), Diana being the goddess of chastity.
	Cloten's plan to use gold to bribe Imogen's ladies is significant, as Imogen has previously (Act 1, scene 2, line 74) used the imagery of gold to convey the true worth of Posthumus. Gold is traditionally seen as the incorruptible metal, as it does not tarnish, but Cloten wants to use it to corrupt innocence.
	There is profound irony in Imogen's hope that her bracelet has not gone to tell Posthumus that she is kissing something or someone other than him, since we know, where Imogen does not, that Iachimo plans to use this bracelet as proof that she is unfaithful.
	Imogen's steadfastness comes across in this scene, as she fearlessly defends herself and Posthumus against Cloten's onslaught.

Summary
	In Rome, Posthumus tells Philario he is sure of Imogen's honor, but has less confidence that he will win over the King. He is leaving it to time. In his exiled state, he regrets he cannot repay Philario for his generosity. But Philario says that Posthumus's goodness and company are payment enough. Besides, he is confident that Lucius, Augustus Caesar's ambassador, will by now have extracted the tribute arrears that he went to collect from Cymbeline. If Cymbeline does not pay up, he will face a Roman invasion.
	Posthumus believes that Cymbeline will not pay and that there will be war. He points out that the Britons are more skilled in war than they were in Julius Caesar's day, when the Roman invaders defeated them.
	Iachimo enters, commends Imogen's beauty to Posthumus, and gives him letters from her. Posthumus asks Iachimo whether his diamond still sparkles as brightly, or is dimmed by Imogen's betrayal. Iachimo replies that he has won the ring, for he enjoyed a night with the ""easy"" Imogen. Posthumus, reluctant to believe Iachimo, warns him not to joke about his losing the bet, and reminds him that they shall not remain friends. Iachimo answers that they will remain friends, since he has defeated Imogen's honor and not wronged her or Posthumus-both were willing participants.
	Posthumus asks for proof that he has ""tasted her in bed"" (line 57). Iachimo describes the furnishings of Imogen's bedroom, the carvings over the fireplace, and even the fire-irons, but Posthumus says he could have heard this from someone else.
	Finally, Iachimo shows Posthumus Imogen's bracelet that he stole from her as she slept. He says it matches the diamond, so both must be his. He claims that Imogen gave it to him, saying ""she priz'd it once"" (line 104). Posthumus suggests that maybe she took it off to send it to him, but Iachimo asks if she says that in her letter, which, of course, she does not.
	Posthumus now believes Iachimo. He takes off his ring, which he says has become a basilisk to his eye (a basilisk was a mythical reptile whose glance was thought to be fatal). He rails against the falseness of women underneath their outward beauty, and the worthlessness of their vows.
	Philario counsels him to be patient and take back his ring, as there is no proof that Imogen is unfaithful. It could be that she lost the bracelet, or that one of her ladies stole it.
	Posthumus agrees, and asks for his ring back from Iachimo. He now wants Iachimo to cite some distinguishing feature on Imogen's body as proof. Iachimo swears by Jupiter that he had it from her arm, which again convinces Posthumus that his wife is unfaithful. He is sure she would not lose it, and her ladies are honorable. Posthumus is once more convinced that she has been unfaithful, and gives the ring back to Iachimo. Philario warns him again that the evidence is not strong enough to convince. But Iachimo describes the mole under Imogen's breast, which he says he kissed. Posthumus says that this ""stain"" confirms another-on her character-""as big as hell can hold"" (line 140).
	Posthumus erupts in fury and threatens to tear Imogen limb from limb in front of her father. Philario and Iachimo follow him out to prevent him from harming himself.
	Posthumus re-enters and delivers a soliloquy against women. He regrets that men need them at all, and says all men are bastards: even he does not know where his father was when he was conceived. His mother seemed chaste, but then so does his wife. He attributes all vices in men to the feminine aspect or ""woman's part"" (line 174): lying, deceiving, ambition, and so on. Even to vice, he says, they are not constant, but ever changing.
	Analysis
	Posthumus uses the imagery of the seasons in his hope that the King will be won over to his marriage. Now, he quakes in the wintry cold of the King's displeasure, but wishes for warmer days (lines 5-6).
	Having failed to persuade Imogen to betray her marriage to Posthumus, Iachimo attempts to persuade Posthumus to betray Imogen, by believing that she is faithless.
	Once again, Iachimo chooses his words for maximum emotional impact. He describes the hangings in Imogen's room as telling the story of Antony and Cleopatra (line 70). Just as Antony was Cleopatra's Roman, hints Iachimo, so was he Imogen's.
	Posthumus's surrender to Iachimo's slanders is marked by his sudden inability to distinguish between appearance and reality. He believes that he is at last seeing the truth when he paints Imogen as being outwardly beautiful but inwardly deceitful. In fact, we know that she is beautiful both inside and out, as was Posthumus prior to his corruption by Iachimo. Posthumus's vision has become delusional.
	There is a contrast between Posthumus's delusion and Cymbeline's. Posthumus's wife is honest but he thinks her false; and Cymbeline's wife is deceitful but he chooses to assume that she is honest. Imogen is the only major character who sees everyone as they are. Yet she suffers cruelly as the victim of others' delusions and dishonesty.
	While Posthumus is undoubtedly a victim of Iachimo's evil, it is clear that he is also a flawed character whose one weakness-an insecurity over his wife's fidelity-is exploited. It is ironic that he is more ready to believe in the incorruptible honor of Imogen's ladies (line 125) than in that of his wife.
	Posthumus takes on board Iachimo's imagery of hell (Act 2, scene 3, line 50) when he refers to Imogen's mole being a stain ""as big as hell can hold"" (Act 2, scene 4, line 140). His final soliloquy against women is as shocking as it is unjust, and must strain the audience's sympathy with him.

	At Cymbeline's palace, Lucius is asking Cymbeline to honor the three thousand pounds a year tribute agreed with Cymbeline's uncle when Julius Caesar conquered Britain. The Queen says it will never be paid. Cloten adds that it is unlikely that there will be another Caesar like Julius; Britain is ""a world by itself,"" and its people will not pay ""for wearing our own noses."" The Queen urges the King not to pay, on the grounds that Britain is a natural fortress, protected by the sea on all sides, and even Julius Caesar was twice defeated before his final victory over the Britons. Cloten says that Britain is stronger than it was at that time. Unless Caesar ""can hide the sun from us with a blanket"", in which case Britons would pay him a tribute for light, they do not see why they should pay. Cymbeline says that Julius Caesar's ambition enabled him to dominate Britain, but it befits a warlike people to throw off the yoke.
	Lucius, on behalf of Augustus Caesar, declares war on Britain.
	Analysis
	Confirming the Queen's earlier statement that she is always able to win the King to her way of thinking, Cymbeline takes a back seat to the Queen in the talks with Lucius, at one point asking Cloten to stop talking and let her finish. This would have been seen as an unnatural departure from the proper order in Shakespeare's time, because Cymbeline is the sovereign monarch and because he is male. In spite of the fact that England was then being ruled by a woman (Elizabeth I), it was generally believed that men, not women, were created to govern countries, and that within a marriage, men should govern their wives.
	Even Cloten speaks more forcefully in this scene than Cymbeline. The fact that it is the Queen and her unintelligent son who are leading the opposition to the Romans does not inspire confidence in the outcome of the war.

A liar has prevailed over Posthumus's ""too ready hearing,"" and Imogen is ""punish'd for her truth"" (lines 6-7). Pisanio observes that Posthumus's mind, compared with Imogen, has sunk to the level of his fortune.
	Posthumus asks Pisanio to murder Imogen. He shall have the opportunity when he delivers a letter to her. If to do so is to do good service, says Pisanio, then he shall not be counted a good servant; he will disobey the order and not tell Imogen of it.
	Imogen enters and Pisanio gives her a letter from Posthumus, which she reads. He writes that he will brave her father's wrath in order to be restored by seeing her. He is at Milford Haven, and hints that she must follow her heart's prompting (presumably, to go there). Imogen is immediately excited by the thought of going to see Posthumus, and asks how long it will take to ride there. Pisanio is less enthusiastic, because he fears that she is riding to her destruction. But she insists that the only way forward for her is to go to Milford Haven and Posthumus.
	Analysis
	Pisanio uses the imagery of disease (""strange infection"") and poison to express Posthumus's unwarranted jealousy (lines 3, 5). But he makes clear that Posthumus's being a victim of such onslaughts does not absolve him of responsibility: Iachimo has simply ""prevail'd / On thy too ready hearing"" (lines 5-6).
	Pisanio has followed Cornelius in disobeying his master for a virtuous purpose. Both Posthumus and the Queen have divorced themselves from truth, and in such cases, the true servant must prevent them from doing evil, if necessary by disobeying orders.

	The scene shifts to a cave in Wales, where Belarius, a banished Lord, is out hunting with his adopted sons. These are, in fact, Cymbeline's lost sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, though they are going under the names of Polydore and Cadwal.
	Belarius contrasts the pride and vanity of the court with the poorer but ""nobler"" (line 22) life they have had to adopt. The humble beetle, he says, lives safer than the grand eagle. At the court, people are reliant on others for approval and live in debt to their tailors. Guiderius points out that while Belarius has the luxury of comparing the two lifestyles, he and his brother do not, since they have never been away from this place. To them, the cave is merely a ""cell of ignorance"" (line 33) and a prison. Arviragus adds that unlike Belarius, they will have no tales to tell when they grow as old as him: they have seen nothing, and are like foxes or wolves, concerned only with hunting their next meal. The only courage they need is to ""chase what flies"" (line 42), a cowardly sort of valor.
	Belarius tells them that there is nothing to be desired in the life of the court, where a climb to the peak of favor will be followed by a fall into disgrace, and where the fear of falling is as bad as the fact. Honorable acts are often punished, and what is worse, you must bow (""court'sey"") in thanks for such treatment. He himself was once loved by Cymbeline, but overnight, he lost favor after being slandered by two false villains. They told Cymbeline he was collaborating with the Romans, and he was banished.
	He promises his adopted sons that the first to hit a deer shall be lord of the feast and that the others will serve him. And, he says, he will fear no poison, which is an occupational hazard at court.
	After the boys leave, Belarius muses how difficult it is to hide ""the sparks of Nature"" (line 79) inherent in the sons of a king. This is in spite of the fact that they have not been told of their royal birth (believing that they are Belarius's sons), and that Cymbeline is unaware that they are alive. When Belarius tells Guiderius, heir to Cymbeline, of his warlike feats, the boy acts out his words and ""The princely blood flows in his cheek"" (line 93).
	Belarius, who goes under the name of Morgan, says that Cymbeline banished him unjustly. In revenge, he stole the royal children in order to deprive the king of his heirs, just as he had been deprived of his lands. But now, ""the game is up,"" by which he probably means that the pretence cannot be kept up any longer.
	Analysis
	Belarius contrasts the low door of his cave, where his exiled family must bow their heads as if to worship the heavens, with the high gates of monarchs, where giants can strut through, keeping their turbans on. He is symbolically making the point that the court is a place of pride, whereas they have learned humility. But paradoxically, their life is nobler than a court life, which is marked by dependence, debt and vanity.
	However, this scene offers a twist on the conventional view of country life offered by Romance plays. It may be more innocent and less corrupt than court life, but to Guiderius and Arviragus, it is as limiting as a prison and as bestial as the existence of a wolf or a fox.
	In comparing himself and his brother to baby birds who have never flown the nest (lines 26-7), Guiderius continues the imagery of birds that permeates the play. Posthumus is represented as an eagle in Act 1, scene 2; and Iachimo, in Act 1, scene 7, calls Imogen ""alone th' Arabian bird,"" a reference to the legendary Phoenix. The Phoenix is said to have risen from its own ashes, out of the fire which burned at the top of the sacred Persea Tree at Heliopolis. It was a symbol of the rising sun and of the dead Sun-god, Osiris, from whom it sprang, and to whom it was sacred. The image foreshadows Imogen's later 'rebirth' from her seeming death.
	Belarius's story of how he fell from favor as a result of slanders echoes Imogen's fall from Posthumus's favor as a result of Iachimo's lies, as well as Posthumus's fall from Cymbeline's favor after he married Imogen.
	The scene illustrates the belief, prevalent in Shakespeare's time, that royal blood cannot be hidden, but will show itself through an inherent nobility of thought and action. Though the roof of his cave is low, the boys' thoughts ""do hit / The roofs of palaces"" (line 83), and they enter into Belarius's war stories in ""princely"" fashion (line 93).
",Cymbeline
238,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 4,"Summary
	Pisanio and Imogen are on their way to Milford Haven to meet Posthumus, as Imogen thinks. Pisanio is disturbed about leading Imogen to her death. When Imogen questions his obvious anxiety, he hands Posthumus's letter to her, in which Posthumus orders him to kill Imogen at Milford Haven for her proven adultery. Imogen asks what it means to be false to his bed: to think of him all the time, and be awakened by frightening dreams about the dangers he is in? She realizes that it is Iachimo who has been false; she suspects too that some loose Italian woman has led Posthumus astray. She herself is like a discarded garment, no longer in fashion, that must be ripped to pieces (line 53). Posthumus will bring all good seeming things into disrepute, as if they were pretended for evil purposes.
	She draws Pisanio's sword and orders him to take it and kill her in accordance with Posthumus's order; she asks him to tell Posthumus later of her obedience. Pisanio refuses and tosses the sword aside. She tells him he must obey his master, and she cannot kill herself as suicide is a sin. Imogen's insistence that Pisanio kill her, as suicide is a sin, triggers a series of religious images. She throws away Posthumus's letters as ""heresy"" (line 82); he is one of the ""false teachers"" of heresy (line 85). She points out that her disobedience against her father in marrying Posthumus was very unusual; she is obedient to his order that she die. She feels sad to think how, when he is tired of his new woman, he will miss her. She asks Pisanio not to delay, since both she and Posthumus want her death.
	Pisanio refuses to kill Imogen, and she asks why he has therefore wasted so much time and trouble traveling all these miles. Pisanio answers that he only wanted to win time to find a way out of his situation.
	He is sure that ""some villain"" (line 121) has abused Posthumus into thinking Imogen is unfaithful. Imogen asks whether this could be a Roman courtesan, but Pisanio says no. He plans to announce that Imogen is dead, and to send Posthumus proof of this. He wants Imogen to return to the court, but she is reluctant because Cloten is there. Pisanio says the alternative is to leave the country. Lucius will arrive in Milford Haven tomorrow. Imogen must disguise herself as a man-he has brought male clothing for her-and live near the house where Posthumus is staying, where she can receive reports on what he is doing. She will then present herself to Lucius and ask for a job as his servant. Pisanio will go back to court in case his absence arouses suspicion that he is involved in Imogen's disappearance.
	Pisanio gives Imogen the box that the Queen gave him, telling her it is medicine that will treat sea-sickness or nausea.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of great pathos in which we sympathize with both Imogen and Pisanio. Pisanio tortures himself with his unwillingness to obey Posthumus and kill Imogen. When he shows her the letter from Posthumus, he says he does not need to draw his sword against her, because the paper ""hath cut her throat already"" (line 33), an image that conveys her vulnerability. Imogen is too innocent even to conceive of being false to her husband, as her bitter speech (lines 40-44) reveals.
	However, Imogen's innocence does not mean she is insipid. She defends herself with great passion and fury against Posthumus's slanders. Her condemnation of Posthumus, that his ""revolt"" against his own apparently virtuous nature would make all good seem as if it were put on for villainous purposes, strikes us as a terrifying curse on mankind. Her rapid-fire command to Pisanio, in reply to his admission that he has not slept since he received Posthumus's order to kill her, to ""Do't, and to bed then,"" is extraordinarily ruthless.
	Imogen uses the imagery of the seasons when questioning Pisanio, asking him whether the contents of the letter he hands her are summer (happy) or winter (sad) news (lines 12-13). Pisanio compares the slander against Imogen with snake venom (lines 35, 39). Reprising the play's bird imagery, Imogen believes that a ""jay of Italy"" (line 49) has seduced Posthumus. A jay has brightly colored plumage, and Imogen imagines this loose woman as being painted with make-up (line 50).
	In another reference to Iachimo's symbolic link with hell, Pisanio rejects Imogen's request that he kill her, protesting that his sword shall not ""damn"" his hand (line 74).
	It is difficult to understand why Pisanio is ready to believe the claim of the Queen, whom he does not trust, that the box she gave him contains healing medicines. But the plot requires that Imogen take these potions, so we are expected to gloss over Pisanio's convenient sudden trust in the Queen.
",Cymbeline
239,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is bidding farewell to Lucius. Lucius says he is sorry that he has to report to his master that Cymbeline is his enemy. Cymbeline explains that the Britons will not endure Caesar's domination, and for the King to show less desire for independence than his subjects would appear ""unkinglike"" (line 7). Cymbeline gives Lucius safe conduct to Milford Haven.
	Cymbeline says that he must prepare the army to fight the Roman forces, which are in Gallia (France) and ready to invade.
	Cymbeline asks the Queen where Imogen is: she has lately had more of a look of malice than of duty towards him. The Queen urges him to treat her gently, and says time will heal. An attendant reveals that the doors to her rooms are locked and their knocks have gone unanswered. The Queen tries to reassure him by explaining that Imogen has asked her to excuse her staying in; she has not been feeling well. The Queen says she forgot to tell him this.
	The King is alarmed, and leaves. Cloten remarks that he has not seen Pisanio either for two days. He follows the King. The Queen, left alone, prays that Pisanio's absence is explained by the fact that he has swallowed her poison. She wonders if Imogen has either killed herself or run after Posthumus; either outcome would suit the Queen, since then her son Cloten would be heir to the throne.
	Cloten re-enters and confirms that Imogen has fled. The King is in a rage. The Queen is secretly pleased, as she hopes that Cymbeline's wrath will prove fatal to him. She exits. Cloten speaks about his feelings for Imogen, saying he loves her for her unrivalled qualities, but hates her for disdaining him and favoring Posthumus. He wants revenge on her.
	Pisanio enters and Cloten aggressively interrogates him as to Imogen's whereabouts. He asks if she is with Posthumus. Pisanio feigns ignorance, saying Posthumus is in Rome so she cannot be with him. Cloten threatens to kill him unless he tells all. Pisanio presents him with a letter (later revealed to be a forgery, in Act 5, scene 5, line 279), seemingly from Posthumus, saying that this is all he knows of her flight. Pisanio is confident that the letter will not put Imogen in danger as she is far away, and hopes it may disconcert Cloten, as it is an apparently loving letter.
	Aside to the audience, Pisanio says he will write to Posthumus saying that Imogen is dead. He prays for her safe return.
	Having read the letter, Cloten offers Pisanio preferment if he will serve him, and do whatever ""villainy"" Cloten asks of him (line 113). Cloten observes that since Pisanio has loyally served the ""beggar"" Posthumus (line 121), he will surely be loyal to him also. Pisanio agrees.
	Cloten asks Pisanio if he has any of Posthumus's clothes, and Pisanio says he has the suit Posthumus wore when he took leave of Imogen. Cloten asks him to fetch the suit. When Pisanio has left, Cloten reveals that he intends to travel to Milford Haven. Because Imogen once said he revered Posthumus's garment more than Cloten, he will put on the suit and ""ravish her"" (line 142), and kill Posthumus in front of her. That way, Imogen will see his ""valour"" to pay her back for her contempt. He wants both to sate his lust (line 146) and to get revenge on her.
	Pisanio apparently overhears some of Cloten's speech, though we are not yet told this. He returns with Posthumus's clothes. Cloten asks him to take them to his room. He then asks Pisanio to be true to him. Pisanio replies that to be true to him would mean being false to that ""true"" man, Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The imagery of buying and selling continues, with Cloten saying Imogen ""outsells"" all other women (line 75) and that Posthumus's base ""weights"" (line 89)-pieces of cheap metal-are worthless. But Cloten reveals once more his bestial nature, threatening to rip Pisanio's heart out (lines 87-8), a wolf-like and predatory image.
	There is irony in Cloten's ordering Pisanio to perform ""villainy"" in his service, which he says will prove him ""honest"" (lines 113-5). This is indicative of the perverted values of the corrupt court that Belarius warned his adopted sons about: the good man is punished, the bad rewarded. Pisanio expands this theme in lines 162-7, where he says that to be true to Cloten would mean being false to Posthumus, whom Pisanio believes is ""true,"" that is, good. This interpretation has been questioned by critics who view Posthumus, after his fall into jealousy, as being far from true. However, it is clear that Pisanio believes Posthumus to be an essentially true man who was abused by a villain.
	In a chilling twist on the outward appearance versus inward reality theme, Cloten will wear Posthumus's garment in an attempt to wreak revenge on Imogen for saying that she valued it above him. He is also attempting to steal some of Posthumus's perceived worth by adopting his garment-a typically superficial act on his part.
	There is a parallel plot theme in Cloten's plan to clothe himself in Posthumus's suit while in the next scene, Imogen appears dressed as a boy. This throws into relief the difference in their motivations: Cloten wishes revenge on Imogen, who he feels has wronged him, whereas Imogen feels only love for Posthumus, who has certainly wronged her. This leads us into one of the grand themes of the Romance plays, forgiveness and reconciliation. A character's redemption or otherwise largely depends upon their ability to forgive and be forgiven.

240,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 6,"Summary
	In Wales, near Belarius's cave, Imogen enters disguised as a boy. She is lost, has slept rough for two nights, and is on the point of collapse from lack of food. She reflects that to lie when prosperous is a greater crime than to lie out of need, and so falsehood is ""worse in kings than beggars"" (line 14). On this basis, Posthumus is among the false ones.
	She notices Belarius's cave. She fears to make herself known, but starvation gives her courage. She calls out, but receives no answer, so draws her sword and enters the cave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's clear-sightedness is evident in this scene. She does not try to attenuate Posthumus's guilt but recognizes that he is false even as she states her love for him.
	The chance that Imogen should come across the cave where her lost brothers live can strike modern audiences as coincidental to the point of absurdity. But such remarkable happenings, particularly involving lost royal children, are part of the Romance tradition.
	Some modern critics have embraced the magic elements of Romance and placed them within the framework of Jungian psychology, which sees events and characters as different aspects of the Self. In this framework, the aim is to bring to conscious awareness all the 'lost' aspects of the Self, resulting in unity of life and purpose. Thus, the lost royal children can be seen as representing the youthfulness and energy that the court has lost. They can also represent parts of Imogen's scattered self. She has been rejected or abused by the major male figures in her life, and to be embraced by her brothers must come as a healing experience.

241,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 7,"Summary
	Belarius congratulates Guiderius for being most successful in the hunt, and names him as master of the feast. Arviragus and he will play cook and servant. The boys are both weary. Belarius notices Imogen in the cave, and remarks that if she were not eating their food, he would think her a fairy. He next thinks that she is an angel.
	Imogen explains that she has stolen nothing and was going to leave them money for what she has eaten. Guiderius is not impressed, as gold and silver ""turn to dirt"" (line 26), and is only admired by those ""who worship dirty gods"" (line 28). Imogen tells him that had she not helped herself to the food, she would have died of starvation. She tells them she is going to Milford Haven and gives her name as Fidele, which means 'faithful' in French. She says a relative of hers has just embarked at Milford for Italy.
	Belarius bids her welcome, asking her not to measure their minds by the ""rude"" place they live in (line 38). Guiderius seems to feel an attraction towards her, saying her would court her if she were a woman. Arviragus welcomes her as a friend. Aside to the audience, she wishes they had been her brothers, for then she would not have been Cymbeline's sole heir, and Posthumus would have been more her financial equal. The boys notice her distress and sympathize with her.
	Imogen reflects that great men could not surpass the two boys. She would change her sex to be their companion, since Posthumus has proved false.
	Belarius invites her to tell as much of her story as she wishes, after they have eaten.
	Analysis
	'Magic sleep' is one of the themes of the Romance plays. It generally marks some transformative change in the characters' lives. It is significant that both Imogen and the lost royal sons arrive at the cave very tired. The mood is heightened by Belarius's first impression of Imogen, that she is a fairy, and his second, that she is an angel.
	Imogen wishes that she had been poorer and offered ""more equal ballasting"" with Posthumus uses another image of weight and worth, this time to express the balance of power in her relationship (line 50).

	In Rome, the First Senator is addressing the tribunes, officers chosen by the people to protect their liberties against the Senate. The Senator announces that Augustus Caesar has decided that the forces now in Gallia are too weak to take on the rebellious Britons. Therefore, the gentry-the land-owning class of people below the nobility-are called to this job. The tribunes must see that this happens. Caesar has made Lucius proconsul and general of the forces.
	Analysis
	This scene is often cut and it is doubtful whether Shakespeare wrote it. It serves no dramatic purpose except to remind us of the forthcoming Roman invasion of Britain. It may have been interpolated because of staging requirements.

	Cloten, dressed in Posthumus's clothes, is in Wales, near the place where Imogen is supposed to meet Posthumus. He says the clothes fit him well, and thus why should Imogen not prove ""fit"" (sexually available) for him, too (line 5)? He feels that he compares well to Posthumus in youth, looks and strength, and surpasses him in birth and advantages. He predicts that soon he shall have raped Imogen, cut Posthumus's clothes to pieces in front of him, and cut off Posthumus's head. The he plans to send Imogen home to face her father. Cymbeline may be angry with Cloten for treating Imogen roughly, but the Queen will take Cloten's part and make him appear worthy of praise.
	Analysis
	Cloten's superficial awareness is again highlighted in his naeve faith that wearing Posthumus's clothes will play some part in allowing him to steal his wife. Bound up on the level of outward appearance, Cloten has no concept of true worth.

244,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 2,"Summary
	Imogen is still disguised as a boy.
	Belarius notices that Imogen/Fidele is not well and asks her to stay in the cave while he and the boys go hunting. Arviragus addresses her as ""brother"". This has an ironic ring for the audience, which knows that he is Imogen's brother, but not for the characters themselves, who do not know they are related and think it a mere expression of friendship. Guiderius offers to stay with her, but she insists that he go, since she does not want to socialize and he cannot cure her by staying.
	Guiderius tells Imogen/Fidele that he loves her as he does his father, though he does not know why. Arviragus says he also loves Imogen, to the extent that, if one among them had to die, he would choose Belarius rather than her. Belarius is not offended by this, taking it as a sign of the youth's inherent nobility that he has noticed something special about Imogen.
	Aside to the audience, Imogen/Fidele reflects on the kindness of her hosts, and says that she has been lied to at court, where it is said that everyone outside that place is a savage. Her sickness, she says, is a heart-sickness (for love of Posthumus). She takes the drug that Pisanio has given her.
	Guiderius tells his brother that he could not persuade the youth to tell 'his' story. All 'he' would say was that he was well-born, but unfortunate, the victim of dishonesty, but honest. He told Arviragus that he might learn more in future. Imogen retires into the cave.
	Belarius comments that the youth evidently has ""good ancestors"" (line 48). Arviragus is struck by his ""angel-like"" singing voice (line 48), and Guiderius by his exquisite cooking skills.
	Cloten enters. He is upset that he has not found Imogen and Posthumus, and suspects that Pisanio has tricked him by giving him wrong directions. He too feels faint.
	Belarius recognizes Cloten as the son of the Queen. Belarius and the boys are viewed as outlaws, and Belarius thinks they should escape. Guiderius decides to stay with Cloten and suggests that Belarius and Arviragus go to search for any followers. Cloten challenges them as they flee and Guiderius is left to answer Cloten, whom he calls a ""slave""-a term of abuse. Cloten calls Guiderius a law-breaker and demands that he yield. Guiderius asks why he should. Cloten replies, by his clothes-he may mean that they show he is from the court. Cloten tries to provoke Guiderius with insults, but Guiderius does not rise to the bait because he sees that Cloten is a fool. Cloten tells Guiderius his name, thinking that will make him tremble in awe. But Guiderius says he would be more fearful of something with the name of toad, adder or spider, that is, something that can harm him (it was thought toads were venomous). Cloten tries again, saying he is the Queen's son, but Guiderius says he only regrets that he does not seem worthy of this high position.
	Cloten wants Guiderius to fear him, but Guiderius is unmoved, saying that he fears (respects) only those whom he reverences; he laughs at fools. They leave, fighting.
	Belarius and Arviragus return, without having found any followers of Cloten. Guiderius comes in carrying Cloten's head. He says that had he not killed Cloten, Cloten would have killed him. Belarius is horrified, but Guiderius is unrepentant. He says the law does not protect them, so why should they allow ""an arrogant piece of flesh"" (line 127), who usurps the role of judge and executioner, threaten them just because they fear the law?
	Belarius says that though he saw no one else, Cloten must have some attendants, whom Belarius fears. He may have come on a dare, to bring the runaway outlaws back, but it is still unlikely that he would come alone.
	Arviragus is philosophical, saying that they must accept their fate and that his brother has done well. Guiderius says he killed Cloten with his own sword and plans to throw his head into the river, whence it will be carried out to sea. He will tell the fishes that this is the Queen's son: this is the extent of his care for Cloten.
	Belarius fears the deed will be revenged, and wishes Guiderius had not done it. Arviragus wishes that he himself had done it, so that the revenge would pursue him. Belarius warns them not to seek danger where there is no profit.
	Belarius reflects that the boys' behavior shows an inherent royal-ness, which they did not need to be taught. He wonders what Cloten's visit will bring in its wake.
	Guiderius enters to report that he has thrown Cloten's head into the stream. They are interrupted by the sound of solemn music played on Belarius's instrument. Arviragus is the one who generally plays this instrument, but he has not played it since their mother's death. Guiderius wonders what solemn occasion merits its use.
	Arviragus enters with Imogen, seemingly dead, in his arms. He makes an elaborate speech, noting all the different flowers he will plant on her grave. The more practical Guiderius cuts him short, saying that they should bury Imogen near to their mother. Arviragus wants to sing the same dirge that they sang to their mother, but Guiderius says he will not be able to sing for weeping.
	Belarius reminds them that they must also bury Cloten, and with royal honors, since he was the son of a queen. Guiderius asks him to fetch the body, though he comments that when dead, a poor person's body is as good as a powerful person's.
	Guiderius sings the dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (line 258), which deals with the mutability of all things, which must ""come to dust"".
	After Belarius and the boys leave, Imogen awakes from her drugged sleep in a delirious state. She is shocked into clarity by the sight of Cloten's headless body next to her, dressed in Posthumus's clothes. She hopes that she is dreaming. But when it becomes clear that she is not, she is convinced that Pisanio has conspired with Cloten to murder Posthumus. The fact that Pisanio gave her a drug that proved ""murd'rous to the senses"" (line 328) confirms his malice. Imogen falls on the body of Cloten.
	Lucius enters with some of his captains and a Soothsayer. A Captain reports that the troops that were stationed in Gallia are now at Milford Haven and ready to fight. The ""gentlemen"" of Italy, commanded by Iachimo, are also sailing for Britain at the next favorable wind. Lucius gives the order to muster the existing troops, then asks the Soothsayer what he has dreamed regarding the war. He replies that he saw Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards and disappearing into the beams of the sun, which means Rome will be victorious.
	Lucius finds the bodies of Imogen and Cloten. The Captain says Imogen is alive. Lucius asks Imogen to explain what has happened, the identity of the headless man, and her interest in him. Imogen, still adopting the persona of Fidele, describes the body as her master, killed by brigands. She laments that she will never find another to equal him. She says his name is Richard du Champ and that her name is Fidele. Lucius says her name fits her faith, and invites her to enter his service. Imogen agrees, and Lucius bids her be cheerful, as ""Some falls are means the happier to arise"" (line 403). Lucius and his men go to dig Cloten a grave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's taking of the drug is another hint, along with the previous references to sleepiness, that a transformation in awareness is about to happen. The regenerative theme is invoked in Arviragus' description of patience and grief as two plants which have taken root in Imogen, and his prayer that the first thrives while the second withers.
	Cloten's insistence that Guiderius should know who he is by his clothes shows the excessive importance Cloten gives to appearance over inner identity. Guiderius recognizes Cloten's foolishness for thinking that the borrowed clothes ""make"" him (line 83). It should be the other way around: men make clothes.
	The contrast between the true world of the Welsh countryside and the false world of the court is clear in the fact that in the country, Cloten's and the Queen's names and high rank fail to strike awe into anyone's heart; venomous beasts, on the other hand, can do harm and are feared. The appearance versus reality theme is picked up again in Guiderius' comment that Cloten does not seem worthy of such high birth. Note the deliberate contrast between Cloten, who constantly expected respect on the basis of his superficial rank, but inwardly did not deserve it, and Guiderius, who is outwardly a poor outlaw but who exemplifies princely and noble behavior.
	This appearance versus reality theme plays into that of worth. Guiderius, after killing Cloten, calls him a worthless ""empty purse"" with no money in it (lines 113-4). After Guiderius has cut off Cloten's head, Belarius fears that ""the body hath a tail / More perilous than the head."" This grotesque image brings home Cloten's bestial nature and is an outward expression of his inward state-all animal appetite with little of the higher reason that in Renaissance thought separated men from beasts.
	Guiderius' quip that he will tell the fishes that the head he has thrown into the sea is that of the Queen's son represents Cloten stripped of his much-vaunted nobility and reduced to the base level of food for beasts. This image strips away the sophisticated but false veneer behind which the court has hidden its moral decay. The headless corpse is symbolic too of the kingdom under Cymbeline: he is a weak king ruled by his wife. The entire episode of Guiderius's killing of Cloten has an oddly fable-like quality. It is presented more as a story of a noble knight killing a monster than how it would be seen in a more realistic play-the murder of the heir to the throne on what appears to be trivial provocation.
	Belarius likens the two boys to nature herself. He compares their gentleness to a breeze that leaves the violet unmoved, and their roughness to the strongest wind that can bend a tree. He says that though they have never been taught royal behavior and valor, it grows in them as a wild (i.e. not deliberately cultivated) crop. This is another example of the theme of inherent royalty or nobility.
	The dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (lines 258-81), is perhaps the best known part of the play. It draws upon the theme of gold and worth, and sets them in the context of the mutability of all things: even ""golden lads and girls,"" those most valued in life, must eventually come to dust, as surely as do chimney sweeps. Death is the great leveler, and makes the ""frown o' th' great,"" ""slander"" and the ""tyrant's stoke,"" as well as mankind's great achievements in the field of learning and lovers' passion, irrelevant.
	Coming so soon after Arviragus' lyrical speech about the flowers he will plant on Imogen's grave, this song has the effect of measuring the world that man constructs for himself and identifies so strongly with, but which all ends in dust, against the great creative force of nature, which endlessly generates new life.
	Belarius's comment about dewy herbs being fittest for graves recalls the Queen's sinister words in Act 1, scene 6.
	Imogen's invocation of a drop of pity as small as ""a wren's eye"" (line 305) represents another bird image, part of the theme of regenerative nature. Another example of the bird theme is the soothsayer's dream of Rome's victory in battle as Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards (line 348).

	Cymbeline asks how his wife is. She has run mad with a fever at Cloten's absence, and her life is in danger. The King is forlorn at the loss of Imogen and the possible loss of the Queen, as well as the absence of Cloten at a time when a frightening war looms. He believes Pisanio knows something about Imogen's departure, and threatens to torture him until he reveals it. Pisanio counters that he knows nothing, but asserts his loyalty to the King.
	The First Lord backs up Pisanio, saying that the day she went missing, he was at court. There is a search party looking for Cloten. The King lets Pisanio off the hook for now. The First Lord tells the King that the Roman forces have landed, together with the Roman gentlemen sent by the Senate. He reassures the King that the British forces are ready. Cymbeline longs for the advice of Cloten and the Queen. The King and courtiers leave Pisanio alone.
	Pisanio worries that he has not heard from Posthumus since he wrote telling him that Imogen had been killed. Nor has he heard from Imogen or anything of Cloten. Pisanio repeats that he is only false in order to be honest; and the wars shall prove he loves his country.
	Analysis
	This scene is unique in that it pushes Cymbeline into the foreground. But he only emphasizes his unkingly nature by lamenting his comfortless state, with his daughter, wife and Cloten all unavailable to him at a time when he is nervous about the war. Cymbeline's uncertain nature compares unfavorably with the youthful bravery of his lost sons, which features prominently in the next scene.

246,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 4,"Summary
	Guiderius notes that he, his brother, and Belarius are in danger from the Romans. Belarius suggests they retreat higher into the mountains. He says that because of Cloten's killing, they cannot go for protection to the King. If they are caught, they will be tortured and killed. Arviragus thinks that the King will be too busy with the war to look into their origins, but Belarius points out that he is well known in the army, and besides, the King has not deserved their service or love.
	But Guiderius and Arviragus believe that they should all go to fight in the wars. Guiderius says he and his brother are not known by anyone at court, and Belarius is forgotten and ""o'ergrown"" (line 33), possibly meaning bearded and unrecognizable, or simply grown out of their thoughts. Guiderius and Arviragus ask for Belarius's blessing to go to war. Belarius replies that since they value their young lives so slightly, there is no reason why he should set more value on his old one. He joins them as they go off to fight.
	Analysis
	The courage of Guiderius and Arviragus, contrasted with Cymbeline's lack of kingly valor in the previous scene, leaves no doubt that it is time for a regime change. Shakespeare's plays uphold the divinely ordained nature of kingship; thus, those who kill, depose or usurp a rightful king must always pay a price. But running alongside this is the idea that kingship is part of the great cycle of nature, in which old, sick and decaying branches wither and die, to be replaced by young, vigorous growth. Cymbeline is the decayed king, while his lost sons, nurtured in the womb of the wild Welsh countryside, are now ripe to assume royal roles.
",Cymbeline
247,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 1,"Summary
	Posthumus is now at the Roman camp in Britain, having joined the Roman forces. He carries with him a bloodstained cloth, sent to him by Pisanio (Act 3, scene 4, line 126) as proof of Imogen's murder. He repents that he had Imogen killed (as he believes), a wife better than himself, for straying just a little. In an example of dramatic irony (where the audience knows what the characters on stage do not), he wishes that Pisanio had obeyed only his just commands, and that the gods had saved Imogen and struck him with more vengeance. Though he has come to Britain to fight against his wife's kingdom, he feels this to be wrong-he has done enough by killing Imogen and will give no wound to her country. He plans to replace his Roman clothes with those of a British peasant, and fight with the Britons against the Romans.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's penitence is somewhat unsatisfying and fails to command much sympathy. He regrets ordering Imogen's killing, but still believes she is guilty. Thus, though he has recovered some sense of perspective regarding her alleged sin, he fails to give her the trust she deserves.
	As we have seen with Imogen, the shedding and adoption of clothing can carry symbolic weight. Posthumus's decision to shed his Roman soldier's clothes and adopt a British peasant's clothing carries many meanings: his attempt to make amends to Imogen and Britain; his abandonment of attempts to control and punish others and willingness to surrender to his fate; and his penitent attempt to replace impressive clothing with inward worth. He will show more valor than his garments suggest, fight as an unknown soldier without the benefit of his martial reputation, and ""begin / To fashion less without, and more within"" (lines 32-3).
	Note the confusion of roles adopted by Posthumus and Imogen. Imogen, a Briton, has disguised herself as a boy and is serving the commander of the Roman army. Posthumus, another Briton, has been exiled to Rome, is supposed to be serving in the Roman army, and arrived in Britain dressed as a Roman, but has secretly defected to the British cause and is now dressed as a poor Briton. Both characters will, in their disguised roles, find a deeper inner truth than they previously knew.
",Cymbeline
248,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 2,"Summary
	Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army enter at one side of the stage, and the British army at another, with Posthumus following, dressed as a poor soldier. There is a skirmish between Iachimo and Posthumus, who disarms Iachimo and leaves. Iachimo, left alone, is penitent that he slandered Imogen, the princess of Britain, and says that his guilt is robbing him of his courage. Otherwise, how could this poor soldier have subdued him, a professional soldier?
	The battle continues. The Britons retreat in disarray and panic, and Cymbeline is taken prisoner. Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus enter and, helped by Posthumus, rescue Cymbeline. Then Lucius, Iachimo and Imogen enter. Lucius sends Imogen away from the fighting, for her safety. Iachimo warns Lucius that the British are bringing in reinforcements. Lucius says they too must bring in more troops, or retreat.
	Analysis
	Coming fast on the heels of Posthumus' penitence is Iachimo's. Both are perhaps less rewarding and dramatic than they should be, since we do not see the journey that led them to this point.
	The decay into which Cymbeline's kingdom has fallen is clear from the shameful disorder into which his army descends. The fact that his lost sons become his rescuer emphasizes the regenerative theme of the new world redeeming the old. The cure for the court's and the nation's sickness lies in the sons' hands. Belarius's involvement is satisfying, since it expiates his sin of stealing the royal children: he heals where once he wounded.
",Cymbeline
249,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 3,"Summary
	Posthumus is talking to a British Lord, who fled the battle. Posthumus says there is no shame in this, since all seemed lost for the Britons, until the gods intervened. He tells the Lord how an old man and two boys-obviously Belarius, Arviragus and Guiderius-turned the battle around by stopping the Britons from fleeing and making them fight the Romans. The Romans are defeated, and Lucius has been taken prisoner.
	Posthumus, disappointed that he did not die in battle, has dressed again in Roman clothing. He comes forward and gives himself up to the Britons, wishing to be taken prisoner and put to death. They capture him and plan to take him to the King.
	Analysis
	Posthumus commands more sympathy in this scene than previously. Giving himself up to the Britons to be put to death is arguably a just punishment for his actions.
	Cymbeline, in another bird image, is compared to a bird without wings (line 5); the Romans are like a predatory animal, ""Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring"" (line 8). However, the Britons win because the gods help them (""the heavens fought"" (line 4). This is one of the play's most notable instances of supernatural intervention-though it is dramatically unconvincing, as is confirmed by the Lord's reaction to Posthumus's account of it-and gives a foretaste of the elements that will follow in the next scene.
",Cymbeline
250,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 4,"Summary
	Posthumus enters in chains, with his jailers. They leave him alone, whereupon he explains that he welcomes his bondage, as it is for him the way to freedom (death). He says his conscience is more of a prisoner than his body, and asks the gods to give him the ""penitent instrument"" (line 10) to pick this lock, setting him free forever. He feels that volunteering to be put into chains is the best way. He asks the gods to take his life for Imogen's, though ""'Tis not so dear"" (line 23).
	He falls asleep. Solemn music sounds to signal the scene of Posthumus's dream. A group of spirits, Posthumus's ancestors and dead brothers, gather round him. They beg Jupiter, king of the gods, to intervene and help Posthumus. Jupiter descends on an eagle, and throws a thunderbolt. The spirits fall upon their knees. Jupiter is annoyed with them, but promises that he will uplift Posthumus's fortunes and that Posthumus will be reunited with Imogen.
	Posthumus awakens, bitterly disappointed that his relatives have vanished. He finds a book on the ground, and hopes that the contents are worthy of the cover. He opens the book and reads a cryptic prophecy. It predicts that when a lion's whelp (Posthumus Leonatus) shall be embraced by ""a piece of tender air"" (Imogen), and when branches shall be lopped from a dead cedar (Cymbeline having lost his sons), but which shall later revive (restoration of the lost sons), then Posthumus shall be happy and Britain shall flourish.
	Posthumus does not fully understand the prophecy, but feels it bears some likeness to his life, and so keeps it.
	The jailers return and tell Posthumus that he shall be hanged. He says he is more than ready. The First Gaoler, with mordant humor, comforts him with the news that he needs fear no more tavern bills: he who dies pays all debts. The Gaoler reflects that he has never seen a person who is so eager to be hanged as Posthumus. He wishes that everyone were good, so that there would be no more gaolers or gallows. Though this would deprive him of his present job, he would hope for a better one.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's opening lines carry an emotional power that is lacking in his earlier speeches. His request to the gods that they take him in payment for Imogen's death, coupled with his certainty that he is worth less than she, is full of pathos.
	The dream scene has perhaps attracted more criticism than anything else by Shakespeare. It is written in poor quality doggerel verse, serves no dramatic purpose, and its style and language bear little relation to Shakespeare's other work, leading to doubts that it is his. The character Jupiter has been called ""preposterous"" and indeed, it is difficult to play this scene without arousing laughter of the wrong sort. It is possible that it was later interpolated-by Shakespeare or another writer - for a performance at the court of King James I, where elaborate masques involving gods, painted scenery and 'flying' persons supported by wires were popular. But equally, it may be that it was written by Shakespeare in one of his less inspired moments.
	The scene is an example of a type of stage device which leant a new phrase to the English language: deus ex machina, Latin for, literally, the god from the machine. It originated with Greek and Roman theater, when a machine would lower a god or gods onto the stage to resolve a hopeless situation. The phrase deus ex machina has been extended to refer to any resolution to a story which does not pay regard to the story's internal logic and is so unlikely that it challenges the audience's suspension of disbelief. Its advantage is that it allows authors to end the story in the way they want.
	Posthumus's hope that the book that the spirits leave behind is not merely ""a garment / Nobler than that it covers"" (line 134-5) recalls the theme of appearance versus reality. Symbolically, the book is important, as it marks the crossing-over of the supernatural world into the natural world. It is inevitable that Posthumus's life will be transformed as a result.
",Cymbeline
251,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is in his tent, surrounded by Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Pisanio. He calls Belarius and the two sons the ""preservers of my throne"" (line 2) and regrets that the ""poor soldier"" who fought so well (Posthumus) cannot be found. Pisanio says that a thorough search has been done but in vain.
	In response to Cymbeline's question, Belarius says that they were born in Cambria (Wales), that they are gentlemen, and that they are honest. Cymbeline creates them knights and promises other rewards.
	Cornelius enters and announces that the Queen has died in madness. Before she died, she confessed that she never loved Cymbeline, but married him for his royal position; that she killed Imogen with poison; and that she had intended to poison Cymbeline slowly with a mineral, winning him over to the idea of naming Cloten as his heir. But when Cloten vanished, she grew desperate and died. Cymbeline says that his senses were not at fault, since she was beautiful and flattered him well, and neither was his heart, which ""thought her like her seeming"" (line 65), but he repents his folly in choosing her.
	Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer, and other Roman prisoners are brought in. Posthumus and the still-disguised Imogen/Fidele follow. Cymbeline tells Lucius that the relatives of the British soldiers who died in battle have asked him to kill the Roman prisoners. Lucius says that the Britons only won the battle by accident, and that if the Romans had won, they would not have threatened British prisoners with the sword. But if they are to die, they will bear it ""with a Roman's heart"" (line 81). He asks only that his page (Imogen) be ransomed, as he is a Briton who has done no Briton harm. Cymbeline says the boy's face looks familiar, and grants his life and any favor he might ask - even the life of the noblest prisoner. Lucius tells Imogen/Fidele that he need not beg for his (Lucius's) life. Imogen tells him that she did not intend to: Lucius's life ""must shuffle for itself"" as she has seen something ""Bitter to me as death"" (lines 103-4). She is, of course, looking at Posthumus. Lucius is hurt.
	Cymbeline asks Imogen/Fidele again what he would like, as he loves him more and more. Imogen offers to tell him in private. While they talk aside, Belarius and the sons remark on the resemblance between this lad and Fidele. Pisanio, in an aside, is certain that he is Imogen.
	Cymbeline calls Iachimo forward and asks Imogen/Fidele to speak his demand to him; he also orders Iachimo to answer honestly, on pain of torture. Imogen asks as her promised favor that Iachimo tell from whom he got the ring. Iachimo admits that he got it ""by villainy"" (line 142); it had belonged to the noble Posthumus, whom Cymbeline banished. As Iachimo begins to tell that part of his story involving Imogen, he almost faints, saying his heart ""drops blood."" Iachimo describes how Posthumus praised Cymbeline's daughter above all other women for her chastity, how Posthumus agreed on the wager, and how by trickery he gathered his 'evidence' of Imogen's adultery.
	Posthumus is anguished that he fell for Iachimo's lies. He comes forward, identifying himself to Cymbeline as the one who had Imogen killed and ranting about his guilt. Imogen interrupts him, and he, thinking that she scorns his feelings, hits her. She falls to the ground.
	Pisanio is shocked, telling Posthumus that he never killed Imogen until now. As Pisanio tends to Imogen, Imogen casts him off, saying that he gave her poison. Pisanio protests that he believed the potion to be a precious medicine. Cornelius points out that the Queen confessed to him that she gave the potion to Pisanio for Imogen believing it to be poison, whereas it was only a medicine to temporarily shut down the signs of life. Imogen reveals that she took it, and Belarius realizes that Imogen was never really dead. Imogen asks Posthumus why he threw her from him, and embraces him.
	Cymbeline now recognizes his daughter, and she kneels for his blessing. Belarius tells his sons that he does not blame them for loving Imogen, since they are her brothers. Cymbeline tells Imogen that the Queen is dead and Cloten gone. Pisanio explains that he gave Cloten a forged letter, seemingly from Posthumus, which guided him to the mountains near Milford to seek Imogen. He planned to violate Imogen's honor, though Pisanio knows nothing more.
	Guiderius explains that he killed Cloten. Cymbeline is stunned. He hopes Guiderius can tell him this is not so, since is reluctant to punish Guiderius, in view of his good deeds in the battle. Guiderius refuses to deny it, and justifies his action on the grounds of Cloten's unprincely behavior. Cymbeline regretfully says that Guiderius must die, by law.
	Belarius intervenes, saying that the boys have merited more from Cymbeline than ever Cloten did. He warns the boys that he must tell a story that will be dangerous to him, though helpful to them. Belarius reveals that he is the man who was banished as a traitor by Cymbeline. Cymbeline orders Belarius to be taken away, but Belarius regains control of the situation with a cheeky joke, asking the King first to pay him for bringing up his sons. Belarius explains that he is not the boys' father, as they believe; they are Cymbeline's sons. He was wrongfully banished; he had the boys' nurse, Euriphile, steal them for him, and married her in payment. Now, he gives them back to Cymbeline, saying that he received his punishment before he stole them, in the form of his banishment. He offers as proof a mantle in which Arviragus was wrapped, and which was made by their mother. Cymbeline recalls that Guiderius had a mole on his neck, and Belarius shows that the older boy still has it.
	Cymbeline rejoices that he has as if given birth to three (the sons and the returned Belarius). He tells Imogen that she has unluckily lost a kingdom, as she is no longer the heir. But Imogen protests that she has gained two worlds, meaning her brothers. Imogen and her brothers reveal to Cymbeline that they have met before (in Wales) and loved each other at first sight.
	Cymbeline, in wonder, wants to hear the rest of the story, but first intends that they will go to the temple to give thanks. He greets Belarius as his brother and gives the order for the prisoners to be allowed to share the celebrations. Imogen promises Lucius that she will yet do him service.
	Cymbeline's thoughts turn to the poor soldier who fought so well alongside Belarius and the boys, at which Posthumus identifies himself as this soldier. He asks Iachimo to confirm that it was he who, dressed as the poor soldier, disarmed Iachimo. Iachimo kneels before Posthumus and begs him to take his life. He gives Posthumus the ring and bracelet of ""the truest princess"" (line 417). Posthumus spares Iachimo's life, saying that he does not do him a favor in so doing (because Iachimo will have to live with his guilt), and tells him to ""deal with others better"" (line 421).
	Inspired by Posthumus, Cymbeline gives a blanket pardon to all.
	Grateful to Posthumus's help in the battle, the sons welcome him as their brother. Posthumus calls for the Soothsayer to explain the cryptic prophecy he found after his sleep. The prophecy ends with a prediction of peace and prosperity for Britain through the descendants of the royal sons.
	In an afterthought, Cymbeline tells Lucius that though the Britons won the battle, he will resume the tribute to Rome, from which he was dissuaded by the wicked Queen. The Soothsayer claims his prophecy (told to Lucius) about the eagle soaring from south to west, vanishing in the beams of the sun, was accurate, since it meant that Caesar (the eagle) would unite with Cymbeline (the sun).
	Cymbeline declares peace and orders the Roman and British flags to be carried through London together. They all go to the temple of Jupiter to celebrate.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of revelations, each of which resolves one of the plotlines of the play. As such, it is a scene in which truth triumphs over falsehood and appearance is stripped away, leaving reality visible.
	Iachimo chooses to reveal his story, which resolves the main plotline of Posthumus's false accusation of Imogen, very slowly, heightening the tension and confirming his ascendancy as the most dramatically painted character of the play.
	After Iachimo's confession, the revelations come hot on each others' heels, creating an atmosphere of wonder and magic.
	Though the resolutions of the intellect happen through these revelations, the resolutions of the heart come with forgiveness. Everyone who has been wronged forgives his or her wronger. The most touching example is Imogen's unquestioning forgiveness of her husband Posthumus. The fact that Posthumus strikes her even as they are reunited makes him seem unworthy of her forgiveness, but this has the effect of exalting her love to the status of divine grace (the sense that God loves even the unworthy sinner). The least convincing act of forgiveness is, ironically, Posthumus's to Iachimo. Posthumus says that he is only leaving Iachimo alive because that way he will suffer more. Once again, Posthumus compares poorly to his wife.
	Posthumus' words as Imogen embraces him, ""Hang there like fruit, my soul, / Till the tree die,"" are moving, though whether they are moving enough to regain the audience's sympathy after all he has done, is a question worthy of debate. Especially difficult to stomach is his striking Imogen when she tries to declare her true identity. Granted, he does not know it is her at the time, but given that he is supposedly penitent about his past treatment of her, it seems an ill omen that leads us to wonder how deep his reformation runs.
	Cymbeline's comment that he thought the Queen to be ""like her seeming"" reveals his characteristic lack of emotional instinct and inability to distinguish outer appearance from reality-the same quality that led him to banish honest men and put his trust in wicked and stupid people.
	Cymbeline's promise to resume the tribute to Rome after the Britons won a bloody victory fighting for this very cause is an anti-climax which has caused some critics to wonder if Shakespeare was laughing at his characters or at his audience. However, it may be a patriotic attempt to save face for the British in spite of the chronicler Holinshed's citation of Latin sources claiming that Rome was ultimately victorious, and the fact that the Roman occupation of Britain persisted for many decades after Cymbeline's reign. Shakespeare shows a battle in which the Britons prevailed, rather than the entire war, which the Romans won; then he shows Cymbeline choosing to resume the tribute to Rome out of generosity rather than through subjugation. It's one way of making out that the Britons won, when they actually lost.

252,The Portrait of a Lady: Novel Summary,"Summary – Chapter One and Chapter Two
	The first-person narrator describes an afternoon tea on the lawn of an old English country house ‘in what I should call the perfect middle of a splendid summer afternoon’. There is an old man sitting on the lawn sipping a cup of tea and two younger men strolling to and fro. The old man is looking at the house, which has a name and a history. It had been built under Edward the Sixth and Elizabeth stayed there for a night. It is now in the hands of ‘a shrewd American banker’ (the man who is sitting) who originally bought it because it was a bargain, but 20 years later ‘had become conscious of a real aesthetic passion for it’.
	One of the other men is a 35-year-old English man called Lord Warburton. The third man, Ralph Touchett, looks ‘clever and ill’ and is the son of the old one.
	The three talk and Lord Warburton says how he finds it difficult to apply Mr. Touchett’s advice to ‘take hold’ of something. His companion tells him he ought to take hold of a pretty woman as he is trying hard to fall in love. Mr. Touchett tells him to ‘make up to a good one and marry her’ and his life will become much more interesting. He then instructs him to fall in love with whomsoever he pleases, but it must not be his niece. Ralph laughs and says this will be a provocation for Lord Warburton and explains how his father has lived with the English for 30 years but has ‘never learned the things they don’t say’.
	Lord Warburton asks about the niece and he is told she is the niece of his wife and she is bringing her to England. Ralph expands on this and says how his mother has been spending the winter in the United States and is expected back. Lord Warburton then asks if the girl is interesting and they tell him they hardly know more than he does, but Mrs. Touchett has described her as independent. Mr. Touchett says he hopes she is not coming to England to look for a husband: ‘So many young ladies are doing that, as if there were no good ones at home.’
	This first chapter ends with Mr. Touchett smiling and saying again to Lord Warburton not to ‘try’ on his niece and Lord Warburton says, ‘perhaps, after all, she’s not worth trying on?’
	In Chapter Two, Ralph wanders away as the other two talk and is unaware that a woman is watching him from the doorway. It is a young lady, a tall girl, in a black dress.
	When he sees her they talk and he explains who Lord Warburton is. She says she hoped there would be a Lord and adds that ‘it’s just like a novel’. Ralph notices she is lingering on the threshold and wonders if she expects his father to come over to her: ‘American girls were used to a great deal of deference, and it had been intimated that this one had a high spirit.’ When he tells her that his father is infirm, she agrees to go to him.
	She tells Ralph that his mother is in her room and will be down for dinner at a quarter to seven. He says he cannot understand how he has never seen her on visits to the United States and she explains the disagreement there had been between his mother and her father when she was a child. He tells her he does not embrace all of his mother’s quarrels and then refers to the recent death of her father. She explains this was more than a year ago and after this his mother has been kind and proposed this trip to Europe. She blushes when he says he sees that his mother has adopted her. He feels a little alarmed and thinks he has underestimated the effect of his words. She tells him she has been taken up by her and adds that she is very fond of her liberty.
	She then goes over to her uncle and Lord Warburton tells Ralph that this is his idea of an interesting woman.
 
Analysis – Chapters One and Two
	The niece of the Touchetts is discussed in Chapter One and arrives in Chapter Two. Although not named yet, this is Isabel Archer and is the central character of the novel. She is also possibly the lady of the title, but it should be remembered that this is left somewhat ambiguous and the title has an element of irony attached.
	There is also an introduction of the theme of Americans living in Europe and the contrast between the New and Old World is drawn upon throughout the novel. The Touchetts and Isabel in particular are representative of the expatriates living in a foreign land that is careful of tradition and perhaps too mindful of protocol.
	These early stages also give an introduction to Lord Warburton and his apparent desire to find an interesting woman. He notes immediately that this young woman, who we are told is independent, fits the scope he is concerned with.

253,Middlemarch: Novel Summary,"Prelude
Summary
	This is a charming vignette of Saint Theresa of Avila as a little girl, holding her brother by the hand, going out into the country side looking for martyrdom, illustrating the “passionate, ideal nature [that demands] an epic life.” Such a girl who has a “rapturous consciousness of life beyond self” could hardly be content with a normal woman’s life. She is the type of many such women today who yearn for an expanded life but are not helped by the “tangled circumstance” of society. This tragic sort of woman in the modern world has no channel for her life force, but only a “vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood.” She is a swan among ducks and finds no fellowship.
	Analysis
	Eliot’s famous Prelude to Middlemarch could be the outcry of the Victorian woman, or women of any age, who have no outlet for their talents or direction for their spiritual lives. They are like the child Theresa, who nevertheless, even in a man’s world, grew up to reform a religious order. Eliot sets up an epic question: what sort of heroism is possible in the modern world, especially for women? Her main character, Dorothea Brooke, is such a modern St. Theresa.
Chapters 1-5 (The Brooke Sisters)
Summary
	Dorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Celia, are two young ladies of marriageable age who have recently come to live with their bachelor uncle and guardian, Mr. Brooke, at Tipton Grange. Though Dorothea is the striking and beautiful older sister, the rural opinion favors the pretty Celia as the one who is easier to understand. While Celia knows life through common sense, Dorothea is always out of place with her refined religious perceptions and longings. Dorothea is severe and Puritanical compared to Celia, who has normal coquettish desires for dress, jewelry, and conquests.
	Dorothea does not want a husband like the neighbor, Sir James Chettham, an amiable but ordinary squire, who is in love with her. She thinks him boring, though in her passion for good works, she persuades him to build decent cottages for his tenants and gives him her designs. He goes along with her plans as he prepares to propose to her. No one reckons on Dorothea’s lofty thoughts of an ideal husband, who would be her superior in learning, and spiritually elevated. Into the picture steps Reverend Casaubon, a clergyman of fifty. Dorothea, not yet eighteen, immediately romanticizes him as a type of Milton or Locke. She wants to devote herself to someone who can teach her wisdom. Mr. Brooke tries to dissuade her from getting engaged to Casaubon, but she accepts him, to everyone’s shock.
Analysis
	One of the main characters of the novel is the narrator who tells the story from the multiple points of view of the characters, while adding her own reflective wisdom. This vantage point gives us compassionate insight into each character but within a certain social context, for the narrator stands for the collective wisdom gleaned from all the lives put together. This narrator is “omniscient” and anonymous, though we can think of her as close to George Eliot’s own viewpoint.
	Immediately, the narrator begins to uncover the fact that most people are lost in their own illusions of reality, one of the themes of the book. She brilliantly weaves together the intersecting illusions of all the characters, showing us the profile of the town of Middlemarch, a fictitious small town in the rural English midlands in the early nineteenth century. Middlemarch stands for English life just before the impact of the industrial revolution. The time is just before the great Reform Bill of 1832. Life is still somewhat simple and conventional here in this backwater, and the citizens are not interested in anything but daily concerns. This sets the stage for their clashes with the more extraordinary and farsighted characters, Dorothea and Lydgate and Will Ladislaw who stand for the forces of change.
	While it could be rather farcical that the beautiful Dorothea, who is constantly compared to the Blessed Virgin, is marrying Casaubon, the “dried bookworm of fifty,” Eliot treats Dorothea’s “soul hunger” as a real and tragic phenomenon in this society. She has no teacher or even comrade to whom she may tell of her own exalted thoughts and wishes. Even her sister Celia, though adoring her, criticizes her, and does not understand her need for living her religious vision in daily life. Dorothea thinks that Casaubon will understand and teach her, while he, it is clear, expects an obedient and self-abnegating wife. The narrator gives us foreshadowing of this problematic marriage by explaining Dorothea’s short-sightedness and “theoretic” nature, desire for “intensity and greatness.” Casaubon also has trouble with his vision and needs a secretary to help him with his life work, The Key to All Mythologies.

254,Candide: Summary: Chapters 1-2,"Chapter 1
 Voltaire begins his picaresque tale by introducing the characters who live in the castle of Westphalia, a province in western Germany.  Candide, which means optimism, is the first character introduced, and Voltaire explains that he is the Baron's nephew.  Though Candide has respectable parents, he is a bastard by birth, yet still seems to be a part of the noble palace family.  He is said to be honest, simple-hearted and gentle. 
Other members of the palace include the Baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh, the head of the castle, and his overweight wife, the Baroness.  Together, the two have Cunegonde, a gorgeous seventeen-year-old princess, a son, and the esteemed palace tutor, Pangloss, who teaches that everything is for the best and that man lives in the ""best of all possible worlds.""
	It seems Dr. Pangloss is quite versed in ""experimental physics,"" for one day Cunegonde spies the tutor ""giving a lesson"" to her mother's ""attractive and obedient"" maidservant in the bushes.  This inspires Cunegonde to yearn to practice this art with Candide.  When the two young lovers do engage in this kind of science, however, they are caught in the act, and Candide is expelled from the castle permanently.

 In the second chapter, Candide finds himself ""ejected from the earthly paradise"" to which he had grown accustomed.  Drifting to a neighboring village, and now very cold and hungry, he stumbles across two recruiting officers of Frederick the Great standing outside a tavern.  The two men seem enamored by Candide's height of five feet, five inches, and offer to buy him a meal.  Trusting their kindness, Candide is reminded of Pangloss' philosophy, that all is for the best; he thinks that perhaps being exiled from the castle (and from his love, Cunegonde), may ultimately lead him to a better end after all.
	Soon, however, these newfound ""friends"" bind Candide with chains, and force him into the army, where he is beaten daily.  At one point, Candide is at the point of being killed (smashed in the head, as he requested in order to end his own misery) when the King of the Bulgars passes and grants his pardon.

",Candide
256,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 3-4,"Chapter 3
Chapter 3 takes place in the midst of a giant battle between the Bulgars and the Abares.  While writing this, Voltaire was probably considering the Seven Years' War (1756-63), which was fought between the French (Abares) and the Prussians (Bulgars).  Here, Voltaire's anti-war sentiments become obvious.  Casually describing the thousands of dead soldiers on both sides, Voltaire underscores how wasteful these ""heroes"" are of human life. 
Candide, his protagonist, hides, doing his best to keep away from the needless bloodshed and ""heroic butchery."" After the battle subsides, he escapes through the battlefield, seeing the ""scattered brains and severed limbs"" that ""littered the ground."" Soon reaching the country of Holland, where he believes everyone is wealthy and Christian, he expects to be treated very well.  He stumbles across a Protestant preacher of sorts who is lecturing on the topic of charity.  Ironically, when the man sees Candide, he attacks the traveler, telling him that he doesn't deserve any bread.  Voltaire, thus, also indicts religion (particularly radical Protestantism in this chapter), which he believed was often hypocritical. 
	Luckily, a man names Jacques befriends Candide, offering him food and shelter.  Candide is elated that such fortune has found him, and he regains his confidence in Pangloss' philosophy.  All seems to be well again. 
Chapter 4
Soon thereafter, Candide takes a walk through the town when he meets a ""ghastly beggar"" who reveals to his pupil that he is Pangloss.  Candide is shocked and horrified to see his teacher in such a state, but immediately asks about his beloved Cunégonde.  When Pangloss explains that she has been killed, Candide passes out.  Upon awakening, he muses, ""Ah, best of worlds, what's become of you now?"" Obviously, Candide's belief in Pangloss' optimistic philosophy is waning, as Voltaire continues his ruthless indictment of Leibniz, Pope and others.
Pangloss, next, begins to explain the events, including the murder of Cunégonde, that occurred at the castle after Candide had been thrown out.  He says that the beautiful Cunégonde was brutally and repeatedly raped by Bulgar soldiers who attacked the family fortress, finally killing both Cunégonde and the rest of her family before destroying the castle.  Yet it seems the Abares were no less hostile to their enemies, as Pangloss notes their similar treatment of a nearby Bulgar castle.
Hearing this, Candide attempts to understand such seemingly needless suffering by asking his teacher about the ""cause and effect"" and the ""sufficient reason"" for such tragedies, specifically his own sorry state.  Pangloss masterfully crafts a brilliant explanation of his disease, which he explains was sexually transmitted from the servant girl, Paquette, to whom the reader may recall he gave ""physics lessons"" in the opening scene.  The doctor gives a detailed, yet brief account of the STD's path, explaining how it transcended through a Franciscan, and Jesuit, and even through the men of Christopher Columbus himself, who received it from the New World natives.  The devil, however, isn't at the root of such a mess, Pangloss asserts, because such suffering is only a small aspect of a larger good.  For example, if Columbus had never sailed to America, chocolate wouldn't exist to tantalize the taste buds of cultured Europeans.
	Fortunately for Pangloss, Jacques, the ""charitable anabaptist,"" pays to cure the teacher of his disease, though the philosopher loses one eye and one ear in the process.  When Jacques confronts Pangloss' systemic philosophy, however, he responds, "".private misfortunes make for public welfare.""

Traveling to Lisbon on a business trip, Jacques brings along his two philosopher friends, Candide and Pangloss.  A terrifying storm ravishes the sea during the boat trip, destroying the vessel and killing all but three of those on board-Candide, Pangloss, and a ""brutal sailor"" who survives at the expense of the kind Christian, Jacques. 
Once ashore, Candide and his mentor see the awful effects of the Lisbon earthquake, a historical natural disaster which killed over 30,000.  With Candide helping many of the surviving victims of the earthquake, Pangloss ""consoles"" the people with his doctrine of universal reason.  When an Inquisition agent asks the wise philosopher if he believes in original sin or free will, Pangloss asserts that both agree with his theory.
Chapter 6
In this chapter, Candide and Pangloss experience the auto-da-fé, a public ceremony intended to avert future disasters through a demonstration of contrition and self-degradation.  This event, like the earthquake which preceded it, actually occurred in Lisbon during the summer of 1756.
	Also connected with Candide's auto-da-fé is the Inquisition, replete with human sacrifices.  Soon Candide and Pangloss find themselves under the category of human sacrifices, having been arrested for the comical charge that one was talking and the other ""listening with an air of approval."" Though Pangloss is hanged (against auto-da-fé custom), Candide, luckily, is only flogged ""in cadence to the music."" This savage pageantry (of Candide being whipped to the beat of a beautiful song) is used by Voltaire to underscore the intolerance and injustice of the Church through its brutal treatment of innocent victims, like Candide, though it maintains the false exquisiteness of tradition.  It's interesting to note that a second earthquake struck the city only a few hours later (Obviously the auto-da-fé was not successful.).
	All this causes Candide to seriously question the optimistic way of thinking, as he seems to be approaching death before an old woman mysteriously appears to aid him.
",Candide
258,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 7-8,"Chapter 7
The strange old woman takes Candide to a shanty, where she clothes and feeds him, taking general care of him for a couple of days without the young philosopher even knowing her identity.  Once he has recovered enough to see visitors, the woman leads him to a nearby house where he meets, of all people, Cunégonde. 
His lover is elated to see him, explaining that although she was close to death, she ultimately survived the attacks of the Bulgar soldiers.  Candide also relates his story, which proves quite touching to Cunégonde.
Chapter 8
Chapter 8 is Cunégonde's story-the account of her rape and her family's murder.  Becoming the prisoner-of-war of a certain, ""attractive"" Bulgar captain, she lives in a sort of quasi-bondage for three months, at which time he trades her to a wealthy Jew named Don Issachar.  When the Inquisitor sees Cunégonde at Mass, he immediately threatens the Jew, finally forcing him to agree to turn over his house and Cunégonde, his sex-slave, one-half of the week.  Yet though Cunégonde's servile status is clear, she boasts that she successfully held both of them off.
	Invited to the auto-da-fé as a spectator, Cunégonde soon notices the tutor Pangloss and her lover, Candide.  Seeing the cruelty shown them, she also begins to lose faith in the philosophy of optimism.  Cunégonde quickly instructs her maid, the old woman, to fetch Candide, which she does.
	At the end of the chapter, Don Issachar, the part-time owner of the estate, enters to ""assert his rights and express his tender passion.""
",Candide
259,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 9-10,"Chapter 9
Seeing what he believes to be another competitor for Cunégonde's love, the Jew attacks Candide, forcing the pupil of optimism to kill him with a sword.  After Issachar's death, Candide wishes that Pangloss were there to give him advice, but settles for the opinion of the old woman in his stead.  Before she can give her counsel, however, the Grand Inquisitor enters for his nightly visit, forcing Candide to kill him as well.  Quickly the old woman details the plan of their escape-that they will take what gold and diamonds they can lay their hands on, and then they should flee the estate on the backs of three horses. 
When the Holy Brotherhood, an organization with both Church and State powers, enters the household to bury their holy Inquisitor and fling Issachar onto a dunghill, the three fugitives are gone.
	In this chapter, Voltaire obviously continues his onslaught of criticism for the Catholic Church, showing the Inquisitor to be nothing more than a worldly womanizer.  He also stereotypes Don Issachar, portraying him as a greedy, selfish money-grubber who hopes to buy himself earthly happiness.

Chapter 10
 Having left an inn where they had stayed the day before, the trio soon realizes that a Franciscan friar, who was also at the inn, must have stolen their gold and diamonds.  To overcome the loss, the old woman suggests, and the others agree, that they should sell one of the horses.
	Eventually they reach Cadiz, a city on the Atlantic coast.  When Candide demonstrates the sign of the Bulgar army, he is made a captain of sorts as he, Cunégonde and the old woman begin their journey to South America.  Candide, obviously still influenced by the optimistic philosophy of his youth, comes to rest on the idea that the New World will be the ""best of all worlds.""
	Yet soon, both Candide and Cunégonde realize that the trials and tribulations of their own lives are not unique or unusual at all when the old woman tells them that their horrors pale in comparison to hers.  She then launches into a lengthy story of her life's misfortunes, making continued allusions to a missing portion of her rear end.
",Candide
260,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 11-12,"Chapter 11
In this chapter the old woman begins to narrate her own life story.  First, she explains how she was born as the bastard child of Pope Urban XX.  Next, the woman proceeds to boast about her past beauty, as well as about her handsome fiancé who suddenly dies just before their wedding. 
At another time, traveling on a papal ship of sorts, she is attacked by invading pirates who strip everyone aboard, fondling the women in the process.  It's interesting to see how Voltaire even uses this woman in his ongoing indictment of the Church.  Though the ship is supposedly defended by papal bodyguards, the old woman doesn't seem to have too high of a regard for them, as she explains the incident: ""Our soldiers defended themselves as papal troops usually do; falling on their knees and throwing down their arms..""
	Used as a personal slave by the African captain, who takes her virginity, the woman, along with her mother and chambermaids, is taken to Morocco to be sold.  When they arrive, they find themselves in the middle of a bloody civil war, which soon claims the lives of everyone except the woman.  With much effort, she manages to drag herself to a nearby stream, where she is approached by an Italian man who sees her beauty and groans about having lost his testicles.
	Voltaire, besides indicting the Roman Catholic Church, also criticizes Islam in this chapter.  The woman subtlety notes how the disciples of Muhammad scrupulously took time out of killing each other to say their five daily prayers mandated by their religion.  Other themes seen in this chapter center around war and man's cruelty to his fellow man.  Voltaire is strongly anti-war, obviously, showing it to be a needless slaughter of human life. 

Chapter 12
The old woman continues her story, as she explains how the kind man cares for her.  Soon, however, the man, who at one time worked as a court singer to the Princess of Palestrina-the woman's mother-shows he cannot be trusted.  For instead of bringing her back to Italy as he promised, he instead sells her in Algiers.  Through this ordeal, she comes down with the plague.  Though she survives, she's sold and resold as a slave to countless merchants and traders.  At one point her captors, facing starvation, even remove one of her buttocks for food.  Finally she ends up as a servant to Don Issachar, the Jew who also buys Cunégonde at a later date.  Finishing her story, she concludes with the thesis with which she began: she is the most miserable of human beings.

261,Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 13-14,"Chapter 13
 As the story returns to the present, Candide and Cunégonde agree with the woman that she has suffered more than anyone else on the ship.  Next, Candide muses to himself, oddly enough, that he wishes Pangloss were present so that he could ""politely"" object to his master's optimistic philosophy.  This brief admission is very significant, for it marks a serious change in Candide's already shifting belief in optimism.
After reaching Buenos Aires, Candide and company quickly encounter the governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueoa y Mascarenes y Campourdos y Souza.  Voltaire purposefully exaggerates his name in order to satirize the man, and the presumptuousness of the nobility in general.  It soon becomes evident that the governor, as expected, is rude and arrogant, as he aggressively pursues Cunégonde's hand in marriage after merely seeing the girl's beauty.
Startled by the sudden arrival of the police, hot on Candide's trail, the old woman urges Cunégonde to earn a life of luxury by marrying the governor.
Chapter 14
 In this chapter, the reader, for the first time, meets Cacambo, a servant/friend of sorts to Candide who has come from Spain.  Fleeing the authorities who are in the process of boarding the ship, Candide and Cacambo hurriedly flee to Paraguay, though Candide regrets having to leave his lover behind. 
	As they enter the country, Cacambo explains to Candide that Paraguay is owned and run by the Jesuits, Los Padres.  According to Camambo, Paraguay is a utopia.  Los Padres are reasonable and just, though they are at war with the Spaniards in this hemisphere and ""send them to heaven"" in Europe.  Here, obviously, Voltaire satirizes the Jesuits for their hypocritical and corrupt religious war, as they slaughter in the New World the very people they baptize and bury in the Old World.
	As Candide and his servant enter a Jesuit outpost of some kind, the guards arrest the pair, treating them almost as prisoners.  When they realize that Candide is German, however, the soldiers quickly change their tune, instead treating Candide and his friend like royalty.  Having been taken to their commander, Candide soon realizes that this man is the baron's son, Cun�gonde's brother, who was reportedly killed by the Bulgars.

The commander, Cunégonde's brother, also referred to by Voltaire as the baron, explains to Candide the events following the Bulgar invasion.  Though his parents were killed and his sister raped, he was befriended by a Jesuit priest, who sent him to Rome, and eventually to Paraguay, letting him serve both the church and the state as a colonel and priest.
Candide and the baron seem to be getting along fine until Candide mentions his desire to marry Cunégonde.  Hearing this, the commander immediately scoffs and even threatens the young philosopher, and a sword fight quickly ensues.  Candide kills his future brother-in-law, and Cacambo, waiting nearby, organizes a fast escape for himself and his master.
	 
Chapter 16
Volaire's 16th chapter is definitely one of his most interesting.  Now in the wilderness of South America, Candide and Cacambo hear the screams of two young women nearby.  Investigating further, they realize that two monkeys are chasing the girls, who run naked.  Lifting his rifle, Candide kills both animals, believing that he has saved the two young girls.  Shocked, he sees the girls turn around, coming back to embrace the monkeys with whom they had frolicked.  Cacambo tries to explain all of this to his master, saying that these women are ignorant of the reason of Europe, and thus engage in the irrational, carnal pleasures of life. 
	Waking up from their sleep a few hours later, Candide and his valet find themselves tied with vines and surrounded by forest natives called Biglugs (Orejones in Spanish).  Apparently the two girls had told their people about the shooting of their lovers, and these Indians found the culprits as they slept. 
	Luckily, the shrewd Cacambo, who even knows some of the local language, speaks to the captors brilliantly about how he and his master are not their Jesuit enemies, but indeed friends.  Hearing this, the natives release their two prisoners, wishing them well.  Candide is elated that his life is spared, even asserting that these people, uncorrupted by civilization, are the best people in the world.  This theory that nature is utopian was taught to him earlier by Pangloss.

 In this chapter the reader is introduced to the most genuine description of utopia in the novel-Eldorado.  Letting a river guide them, they accidentally (or perhaps providentially) end up in the land of gold and jewels.  Candide thinks to himself that surely this is the best of all possible worlds, as his teacher always said really did exist.
Chapter 18
 Having been taken to an old man's home, Candide and Cacambo are told the history of El Dorado, which was at one time part of the Inca empire.  Soon they begin discussing religion, and Candide is relieved to know that the people of this land worship a single deity.  Though they don't pray to this god (since there's nothing for which to pray), they do thank Him in everything they do.  Everyone is a priest, the man explains; there is no need for monks or other church officials since this world is a utopia.
	Tooled with several red sheep to haul their carriage, Candide and his servant go to the king's castle.  Touring the capital, they realize that there are no government institutions, no prisons and no need for lawyers. 
	Having spent a month in this place, both Candide and his friend being to grow restless, and Candide in particular greatly misses his lovely Cungonde.  The two, thus, make plans to leave the place, taking with them enough golden pebbles to make them the richest men alive in their former world.

Having left Eldorado, Candide and Cacambo begin their journey back to Europe.  After several days into their long trek have passed, however, they have lost all but two of their sheep.  Seeing an abused African slave stretched out on the road before them, the two question him, and learn that a very religious Christian man is his master.  Hearing this, Candide admits to himself, ""I'm through, I must give up [Pangloss'] optimism after all... It is a mania for saying things are well when one is in hell.""
Next, Candide and Cacambo agree to split up, with Candide deciding to wait in Venice for Camabo, who agrees to return to Buenos Aires to bribe the governor to hand over Cunégonde.  Unfortunately for Candide, a sly merchant steals two of his diamonds.  Angry and dejected, Candide tries to get the authorities involved, but they are less than helpful or polite.  Soon he resolves to himself that if there is a place where everything is for the best, ""it is in Eldorado and not in the rest of the world.""
	Wanting a companion for his voyage, he asks a few nearby people if they wish to travel with him in exchange for lodging and money.  Wanting to reward the most unlucky applicant, Candide finally selects a scholar who seems to have had a horrible lot in life.
Chapter 20
The scholar, named Martin, who Voltaire explains is very learned in the area of identifying moral evil, and Candide, who is also quite practiced in the art, begin their journey.  Despite his experience, Voltaire admits that his protagonist still subscribes to optimism, since he still has hope of one day seeing Cunégonde. 
	Talking philosophy with his new valet, Candide learns that Martin is a Manichee, a believer in a world with almost equal amounts of good and evil.  He sums up his philosophy, saying, ""In a word, I have seen so much and suffered so much, that I am a Manichee.""
	Outside they see two warring ships, one of which sinks.  Eventually Candide learns, when a red sheep floats to the surface, that the sunken ship carried his stolen treasure.  Candide tries to use this event to his advantage in his argument with Martin, asserting that the thief received his just reward.  Martin, however, astutely points out that many innocent people also died when the ship went down.

 Finally, Candide and Martin reach France.  It soon becomes obvious to the reader that Martin has a very little regard for Paris social society, as he describes its inhabitants as a mob, always seeking pleasure but never finding it. 
Candide, sensing Martin's distaste for the country, explains that he doesn't want to stay long himself, but simply plans to use France as a way to get to Venice, where he will wait for his beloved Cunégonde. 
Martin seems to be very disillusioned with life, saying that he's seen it all.  When Candide asks him if he believes men have always been evil, Martin responds in the affirmative, comparing humans to hawks-species which live by instinct.  Candide tries to refute his argument, however, asserting that man has free will.

Chapter 22
 Candide decides to visit Paris while he and Martin pass through France.  While staying in a hotel, all of those around Candide try to take advantage of him, hoping to siphon off some of his wealth.  They cheat him at cards, seduce him, and even pretend to be Cunégonde herself (of course a very sick, mute Cunégonde who cannot be exposed to light), in order to exhort his money-and each scheme is very successful.  Later, they see a play at the theater and one of the actresses in the production reminds Candide of Cunégonde.  Next, being entertained at a home where he meets a wise man, Candide immediately asks him if he subscribes to Pangloss' philosophy of optimism.  The man says he doesn't, maintaining that ""everything goes wrong in our world.."" Candide responds by repeating Pangloss' teaching that ""troubles are just the shadows in a beautiful picture."" At this point, however, Martin asserts that ""the shadows are horrible ugly blots.""
Later, though he feels guilty about it afterwards, Candide is unfaithful to Cunégonde with the ""lady"" of the household, who simply wanted (and received) his diamonds.  Eventually, Candide grows fed up with the scheming which surrounds him, so he tells Martin that they must escape from this ""hell.""

	Hearing this, Candide is taken aback and consequently refuses to set foot on English soil, instead arranging for his passage directly to Venice.  Finally reaching Venice a few days later, Candide resurrects a lesser version of Pangloss' optimism, saying, ""all goes as well as possible.""
	Chapter 24: Now in Venice, Candide makes his first priority to find Cacambo, hoping that he has brought Cunegonde.  After a few days of fruitless searching, he grows despairing, finally resolving to Martin that Cunegonde is dead, that ""all is but illusion and disaster.""
	Turning a moment from his deep sadness, Candide sees a monk and a prostitute walking down the street, arm in arm.  Candide bets Martin that the couple is happy.  After he invites them to dinner, Candide realizes that the young girl is Paquette, the maidservant to his old baroness and the woman who gave Pangloss the STD.  Quickly she fills Candide in on the miseries of her own life.  The monk also explains how he is quite unhappy with his lot in life.  After hearing all of this, Candide is forced to admit that Martin has won the bet.

	Later, when Candide and Martin discuss their visit alone, Candide tries to salvage his premise that Pocourante is the happiest of all men, saying that there must be some kind of pleasure in ""seeing faults where other people think they see beauties."" Yet when Martin challenges his thesis, Candide admits that perhaps only he himself is optimistic at the prospect of again seeing Cunegonde.

Next speaking to Cacambo, Candide learns that Cunégonde too is a slave, working as a dishwasher, and ugly to boot.  Candide, however, says that he doesn't care what she looks like, as long as he can see her again.

Both the baron and Pangloss explain the circumstances which led to them escaping death.

	Act 1, scene 1
	Two gentlemen are talking in the palace of Cymbeline, King of Britain. The First Gentleman says that all the courtiers are frowning, reflecting the sorrowful mood of the King. He explains the reason: the King's daughter, Imogen, has married Posthumus Leonatus, a poor but worthy man, against the wishes of her father and his current wife, the Queen. The King has banished Posthumus and imprisoned Imogen. The King and Queen had wanted Imogen to marry Cloten, the Queen's son by a previous husband.
	The First Gentleman says that despite their sad appearance, the courtiers are secretly glad about the marriage, as Cloten is ""too bad for bad report"" (line 17). In contrast, he says Imogen's chosen husband is both outwardly handsome and inwardly good. He is the son of Sicilius, who won military glory fighting for King Cymbeline's father, Tenantius, against the Romans. Sicilius earned the surname Leonatus (lion's whelp) for his bravery. Besides Posthumus, Sicilius also had two other sons, who died in battle, ""with their swords in hand"" (line 36), whereupon Sicilius died of grief. Sicilius' wife was pregnant and died giving birth to Posthumus.
	Since Posthumus was now an orphan, the King took him under his care and brought him up. Posthumus grew to be loved and respected in the court. The First Gentleman says that his virtue is demonstrated by the fact that Imogen, the King's daughter and heir, has chosen him. Imogen is the King's only child. He once had two sons, but twenty years ago, both were stolen from the nursery when the eldest was three and the youngest a baby. The Second Gentleman is surprised that the King's children were so poorly guarded, and the search so slow that it could not trace them.
	The gentlemen end their talk as the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen enter.
	Analysis
	Little is known about the historical Cymbeline, son of Theomantius (Shakespeare calls him Tenantius). He became King of Britain in 33 BC, when it was an outpost of the Roman empire. He reigned for 35 years, leaving two sons, Guiderius and Arvigarus. He was brought up in Rome and was absolved by Augustus Caesar of paying tribute. Subsequently, tribute was demanded and refused, but the chronicler Holinshed, one of Shakespeare's main sources, is unsure whether Cymbeline or some other King refused to pay. Caesar then invaded Britain. Holinshed wrote that British chroniclers claim the Romans were twice defeated in battle, but comments that Latin sources claimed ultimate victory for the Romans. Shakespeare, for the purposes of his play, has Cymbeline refuse to pay the tribute.
	The play's first scene is an expository one in that it gives the background to the story and tells us something about the main characters. It sets up a stark contrast between Imogen's two suitors: the Queen's son Cloten, an unworthy man, and the King's ward, Posthumus, as virtuous as he is attractive.
	It also introduces two major themes of the play. The first is outward appearance (the courtiers' sad faces) versus inward truth (their happiness at Imogen's marriage to Posthumus). At court, the two are at odds, leading to a hypocritical atmosphere. Related to this theme is outward nobility of birth (which Cloten has), which is not earned and which can be superficial, versus inward nobility of character (which Posthumus has), which must be earned and runs deep. Imogen, who is both well-born and appreciates true goodness, unites both. However, in her decision to marry the poor but worthy Posthumus, she has initiated a conflict with her parents, who are unable to see beyond his undistinguished birth.
	The disappearance of the King's sons carries intense symbolic importance. The Romance tradition of literature often featured a king who was wounded or disabled in some way. When the king, the symbolic head of a nation, was sick, his country was sick too: crops failed, disease and famine thrived. The hero of the story went on a quest to find the regenerative ""cure"" for the king's ailment and, by extension, his country. In this tradition, to which all Shakespeare's Romance plays (A Winter's Tale, The Tempest, Pericles and Cymbeline) belong, the cure is often found by someone from the younger generation, which represents regeneration, fertility, and vigorous new life.
	In Cymbeline, the fact that the King has lost his sons leaves him cut off from this life-giving quality. Only Imogen is left of the younger generation, but the King has rejected her. Severed from the regenerative root, the King and his court are left to wither and decay in destructive emotions like resentment and revenge. Through reference to the Romance tradition, we expect that Cymbeline's cure will involve being reunited with his sons and reconciled with Imogen.
",Cymbeline
270,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Summary
	The Queen tells Imogen that she is no wicked stepmother in that she supports her in her decision. She will have Imogen set free and speak in favor of Posthumus to the King. But she advises Posthumus to comply with the King's sentence of banishment. Posthumus agrees to leave today. The Queen leaves the newly-wed couple alone ""in pity"" of their state, in spite of the King's orders that they should not speak together.
	Imogen tells Posthumus that the Queen is only pretending to be on their side. She has braced herself to stay and face her father's anger, and sorrowfully urges Posthumus to leave. Posthumus, moved by Imogen's grief, pledges his loyalty to her. He will go to Rome and stay with his father's friend Philario.
	The Queen re-enters and advises the couple to be brief as she is at risk of angering the King. In a sinister aside to the audience, she reveals that she is sure of winning the King over to her way of thinking, since he always submits to the wrongs she does him in order to keep her friendship.
	Left alone with Posthumus, Imogen gives him a diamond ring, which belonged to her mother. She asks him to keep it until he woos another wife, after she herself is dead. He protests that he only wants one wife - Imogen - and that he would die sooner than take another. He puts the ring on her finger and also gives her a bracelet to wear for his sake.
	As Imogen wonders when they will meet again, Cymbeline comes in, furious to see Posthumus still there. Posthumus leaves with a blessing on ""the good remainders of the court"" (line 60). The King then charges Imogen with disloyalty, but Imogen advises him not to harm himself with his wrath; she is senseless of it, since parting from her husband is a greater pain. He accuses her of bringing ""baseness"" on his throne by taking a ""beggar"" for her husband; she insists that she has added ""lustre"" to it (line 74). She points out that it is Cymbeline's fault that she loves Posthumus, as Cymbeline brought them up together, and adds that Posthumus is ""a man worth any woman"" (line 77).
	As the Queen enters, Cymbeline scolds her for disobeying his command and allowing the couple to meet. The Queen asks the King to leave her with them, which he does.
	Pisanio, Posthumus's servant, comes in and tells the Queen that her son Cloten has drawn his sword on Posthumus. Posthumus was not incited to anger and did not try to hurt Cloten; others parted them. Imogen wishes they had been in some lonely place and that the fight had been concluded, presumably with the destruction of Cloten. Posthumus has sent Pisanio back to serve Imogen. Imogen asks him to come and see her in half an hour's time.
	Analysis
	The King is consumed by anger that his ambitions for his daughter have been thwarted, and the Queen is engaged in scheming for her own selfish ends. It is left to the young couple, Imogen and Posthumus, to act from a basis of love and selflessness. Our sympathies are with them, and this is reinforced by Posthumus's generous treatment of Cloten, whom he avoids harming in a fight even though Cloten was the aggressor.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is developed further. Imogen refers to the Queen's ""dissembling courtesy"" (line 15), as she sees that the Queen is really self-serving underneath her pretended support for the newly-wed couple. The Queen reveals her hypocritical nature in an aside which tells the audience that she plays upon the King's emotions for her own ends (lines 35-7).
	The contrast between outward rank and inward worth is brought home in Cymbeline's accusation that Posthumus is a base ""beggar"" since he is low-born, whereas Imogen protests his true worth.
	It is worth noting in this scene that Imogen wishes that she were a goatherd's daughter, and Posthumus a shepherd's son. The theme of the innocence and purity of the countryside and its dwellers contrasted with the corruption of the court is a traditional one of Romance plays.
",Cymbeline
271,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 3,"Summary
	The First Lord advises Cloten to change his shirt, which smells as a result of his fighting with Posthumus, though the Lord, in an attempt to flatter Cloten, tries unconvincingly to suggest that it is the air outside Cloten's shirt that is unwholesome. Cloten only sees the need to change his shirt if it were bloody, and asks if Posthumus is hurt. The Second Lord reveals in an aside to the audience that he is not, but the First Lord tries to flatter Cloten by saying it would be remarkable if Posthumus were not hurt. The Second Lord continues to address the audience in asides revealing Cloten's cowardice and Posthumus's bravery in the fight. Cloten claims he wishes the onlookers had not parted them, and the Second Lord says in an aside that he wishes Posthumus had killed Cloten.
	Cloten is astonished that Imogen could prefer Posthumus to himself. The First lord replies that her beauty exceeds her intelligence.
	Analysis
	The Second Lord echoes Imogen's wish in the previous scene that Posthumus had killed Cloten. This sets up an expectation that Cloten may indeed be disposed of. The contrast between the First Lord's flattering remarks to Cloten and the Second Lord's contempt for him, expressed in asides to the audience, reveal the hypocrisy and underlying discontent at court, where people say one thing but think another. Such disunity in Shakespeare indicates an unsustainable situation, since if truth is to prevail, that which is false must be destroyed.
	Cloten's vanity and lack of self-knowledge are plain in this, our first sight of him. Cloten speaks in prose, revealing his unrefined nature, whereas Imogen and Posthumus address each other in blank verse, as befits their more refined characters. Cloten also smells bad, which in Shakespeare is a sure sign of an uncivilized nature.
",Cymbeline
272,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 4,"Summary
	Imogen questions Pisanio about his last sight of Posthumus and hopes he will write. Posthumus's final words were about Imogen as he unwillingly sailed away from her. Imogen regrets that she did not have time to say all that she had wanted to her husband - her worries that Posthumus would be tempted away from her by Italian women, and her desire that he should think of her at certain pre-arranged time - before Cymbeline came in and interrupted them.
	A lady enters and tells Imogen that the Queen wishes to see her.
	Analysis
	The love between the young couple is reinforced by Pisanio's account of Posthumus's actions on leaving.
	The language of the seasons and nature's cycles runs through all the Romance plays. Here, Imogen likens her father's interruption of her meeting with Posthumus to the ""tyrannous breathing of the north"" that ""shakes all our buds from growing"" (lines 36-7). The young lovers embody the regenerative and life-giving warm spring season (the previous scene, Act 1, scene 3, line 31, already implied that Imogen was like the sun), whereas Cymbeline represents the chill north wind that prevents the growth of their love.
",Cymbeline
273,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 5,"Summary
	The scene is set in Rome at the house of Philario, where Posthumus intends to stay. Iachimo, a friend of Philario's, is speaking cynically about Posthumus, whom he has seen on a trip to Britain. He hints that he may not be as worthy as he is popularly believed to be. Philario replies that Posthumus has since grown in worth ""both without and within"" (line 10). Iachimo suggests that his marriage to the King's daughter gives him a reputation he does not deserve, and that people would rather exaggerate Posthumus's goodness than question Imogen's judgment for ""taking a beggar"" (line 24). He asks Philario why Posthumus is staying with him. Philario explains that he and Posthumus's father Sicilius were soldiers together, and that Sicilius saved his life.
	Posthumus arrives and Philario introduces him to the others present-Iachimo, a Frenchman and a Dutchman. The Frenchman reminds Posthumus that he has met him before, at Orleans, where he made peace between Posthumus and another Frenchman when they were about to fight over a trivial matter. Posthumus protests that the matter was not trivial. Iachimo inquires what it was, and the Frenchman explains that Posthumus had maintained that his lover, Imogen, was more beautiful, chaste and virtuous than any woman in France. Iachimo sneers that either the lady or Posthumus's opinion must not still exist. Posthumus protests that both her virtue and his opinion hold. Iachimo extends the quarrel, saying Posthumus cannot set her above Italian women. Posthumus will not give ground.
	Iachimo introduces a comparison between Posthumus's wife and his diamond. It may be, he says, that the diamond outshines many others that he has seen, but he has not seen the most precious diamond in existence, and neither has Posthumus seen the best woman in existence. When Posthumus says he values his diamond as more precious than any other, Iachimo wrongly implies that he prizes his diamond above Imogen. But Posthumus sets him right, pointing out that Imogen cannot be bought or sold, and is ""only the gift of the gods"" (line 88). Iachimo suggests that of Posthumus's two priceless things, the diamond ring and Imogen, the one could be stolen and the second is ""frail"" (line 94); both are vulnerable to thieves. Posthumus replies that Italy contains no courtier accomplished enough to convince Imogen to betray him, and neither does he fear the loss of his ring.
	Iachimo issues a challenge to Posthumus: he says he could get the better of Imogen's-or any woman's-virtue ""even to the yielding,"" an expression that implies sexual as well as military surrender. He wagers half his estate against Posthumus's ring that he will prevail. Posthumus refuses, saying that Iachimo deserves punishment.
	Philario intervenes, asking them to forget their disagreement. Iachimo now wishes he had extended his wager to include his neighbor's estate. He suggests a bet of ten thousand ducats against Posthumus's ring that, given an introduction to the court where Imogen lives, he will defeat her honor and bring back proof. Posthumus agrees to the wager with the addition that if Iachimo prevails, he will not treat him as an enemy, since Imogen will not be worth the debate. But if Imogen refuses to be seduced, then for the insult Iachimo has offered to her chastity, Posthumus will fight him. Iachimo agrees and says they will have a legal agreement drawn up.
	Analysis
	Philario says he is happy to let Posthumus's true worth speak for itself, rather than praise him unnecessarily: such is his confidence in the reality of his goodness. In Posthumus's case, there is no difference between appearance and reality.
	Iachimo, in contrast, who cynically judges all men by his own debased standards, tries to suggest that Posthumus's reputation is not deserved and that he borrows any perceived worth from his marriage with the King's daughter. His attitude is a veiled warning that he will try to prove his mean estimation of Posthumus to be true-that he will attempt to bring him down to his own base level.
	Iachimo's military metaphors are worth noting. He says that popular praise of Posthumus is calculated to ""fortify"" Imogen's questionable judgment, which is so weak it would fall before an ""easy battery"" (lines 21-3). He is confident that his conversation could ""get ground of"" Imogen (line 108) and make her yield-military terms for driving an enemy into retreat and making them surrender. This says much about his world view: to him, good people are enemies to be vanquished.
	Iachimo's skill in making mischief is clearly portrayed in this scene. On hearing that Posthumus was previously willing to fight to defend his lady's virtue, he realizes that this is a sensitive area where Posthumus is vulnerable to attack. He quickly divines the things that are most precious to Posthumus (Imogen and the diamond she has given him), and attempts to equate the two by suggesting that Imogen can be stolen as easily as the diamond.
	This scene makes use of images of buying, selling, and worth, a major theme in the play. The cynical Iachimo implies (line 15) that as a poor man, Posthumus's worth is only borrowed from the King's daughter, that he is ""weighed rather by her value than his own."" Also, Posthumus and Iachimo discuss in detail what Imogen, and Posthumus's diamond, are worth.
",Cymbeline
274,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 6,"Summary
	At Cymbeline's palace, the Queen is giving instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground. Then she asks the doctor, Cornelius, whether he has brought the drugs. He presents a box to her, but his conscience prompts him to ask why she requires these slow but deadly poisons. Annoyed at being questioned, she replies that while the doctor has trained her in the herbal arts of distilling and making perfumes, she wants to extend her skill by testing these compounds on non-human subjects - by implication, animals. Cornelius is not impressed, and points out that she will only harden her heart.
	The Queen ends the conversation abruptly and Pisanio enters. In an aside, the Queen reveals her intention to try her poisons first on him, as he is on Posthumus's side and an ""enemy"" to her son in the question of Imogen. As she dismisses Cornelius, he remarks in an aside that he knows of her malice, and will ensure that she does no harm. The drugs he has given her are not the deadly poisons she requested, but potions to ""stupefy and dull the sense awhile."" She will try them on cats and dogs, and later humans, but the effect will be merely to lock up the spirits temporarily, only for the subject to awaken refreshed.
	The Queen hopes Imogen's affections for Posthumus will cool. She promises Pisanio that when he brings her word that Imogen loves Cloten, she will make him as great as his master, Posthumus. In fact, he will be greater, as Posthumus cannot return; neither can Posthumus provide for Pisanio.
	The Queen then drops the box, and Pisanio picks it up. The Queen urges him to take it as a token of further favors she intends to him, claiming she has five times saved the King's life with its contents. She orders Pisanio to tell Imogen what she must do (presumably, to renounce Posthumus and marry Cloten). She reminds him that if he brings about her desire, he will still have his mistress, Imogen, and Cloten also to give him preferment. In addition, she will persuade the King to grant whatever he wishes, and she herself will be obligated to reward him.
	Pisanio leaves without responding, and the Queen reveals that she mistrusts him, as she believes he is still loyal to Posthumus and Imogen. She says if he takes what she believes to be poison, Imogen will have no supporters. If Imogen continues to defy the Queen, she too will be given poison, leaving Cloten as heir to Cymbeline's throne. Pisanio re-enters to reveal to the audience that he would rather choke himself than prove untrue to Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The Queen's instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground has sinister significance. Belarius, at Act 4, scene 2, lines 284-5, comments that ""The herbs that have on them cold dew o'th'night / Are strewings fitt'st for graves."" Herbalists advised that medicinal herbs should be picked when dried by the sun, since dewy herbs would rot quickly and would therefore be less wholesome and unsuitable for healing. The Queen, obsessed with poisoning people who stand in her way, wants to put the flowers to an evil use, which stands in contrast to the life-affirming floral imagery surrounding the young lovers. This is part of the play's theme of the regenerative role of the younger generation contrasted with the destructive and decaying role of the older generation.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is presented with a twist in the doctor's determination to be true to mankind in general by being false with the Queen: by his lie about the effects of the herbs he has given her, he will save her intended victims from poison.
	The Queen's treachery and deceit is contrasted with the loyalty and integrity of Pisanio and Cornelius.
",Cymbeline
275,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 7,"Summary
	Imogen is lamenting her unhappy situation, and wishes she had been stolen like her brothers. Pisanio enters with Iachimo, introducing him as a gentleman from Rome who has brought letters from Posthumus, who is safe. In an aside, Iachimo praises Imogen's beauty and admits that if her mind is as admirable, he has lost his wager.
	Posthumus, in his letter, asks Imogen to treat Iachimo well in return for his ""kindnesses"" to Posthumus (line 23). She welcomes him. Iachimo appears to be wonder-struck by Imogen's beauty, and muses aloud how anyone could fail to distinguish between fair and foul. He seems to imply, without actually saying it outright, that there is another woman whom, in spite of her obvious inferiority (""sluttery,"" line 44), Posthumus is driven by lust to prefer to Imogen.
	Imogen is mystified but changes the subject, asking after Posthumus's health and state of mind. Iachimo takes his chance to blacken Posthumus's character further, saying he is so merry that he is called ""the Briton reveller"". Imogen says he is more usually inclined to sadness; Iachimo replies that he has never seen Posthumus sad. On the contrary, he says, he laughs at a Frenchman who is pining after his girlfriend at home, for wasting time in such ""bondage."" He suggests that Posthumus is abusing his God-given bounty (both his own talents and his wife), and says he pities them. Posthumus neglects his ""sun"" (Imogen) and takes solace in a dungeon by the light of a burned-out candle, a a reference, perhaps, to a sordid and secretive place or to the worn-out slut whom he alleges Posthumus meets there.
	Imogen asks Iachimo to speak more openly, as she would rather know the truth. Iachimo protests that if he had a woman such as Imogen, he would never pursue common prostitutes. Imogen is worried, saying that her husband ""has forgot Britain"" (line 113). Iachimo says Posthumus is forcing her to live a nun-like life while he is living a sexually promiscuous life on her money. He urges her to revenge and dedicates himself to her ""sweet pleasure"" (line 136), saying that unlike Posthumus, he will be loyal to her.
	He tries to kiss Imogen, but this action prompts her to see Iachimo for what he is. She calls for Pisanio, and rejects Iachimo's advance, reproaching herself for listening to him. His motivation, she says, was not virtuous but self-seeking, to obtain her for himself. She says he has wronged Posthumus and that she will tell her father of his assault.
	Iachimo rapidly changes direction, protesting that his aim was only to test her loyalty to Posthumus, and that he did so out of love to him. He begs her to forgive him, which she does.
	Iachimo then asks Imogen to store a trunk containing expensive plate and jewels which he, Posthumus and some other friends have jointly bought as a gift for the Roman Emperor. She agrees, and as Posthumus has an interest in them, says she will keep them in her bedroom. Iachimo says he will have them sent to her just for tonight, as he must leave tomorrow. She tries to persuade Iachimo to stay, but he cannot. He suggests that she write Posthumus a letter tonight so that he can return with it tomorrow.
	Analysis
	Iachimo's base nature is displayed in his use of animal imagery (lines 39-50). Apes, he says, would discriminate better than Posthumus does between Imogen and the imaginary ""slut."" He likens Posthumus to a predator which devours first the lamb (Imogen) but, still hungry, wants to feed on ""garbage.""
	Iachimo's description of Posthumus in exile as ""the Briton reveler"" is calculated to upset Imogen and make her suspicious of her husband's loyalty. He uses images of rot, decay, disease and poison to excite disgust at Posthumus's supposed life of whoring: ""Such boil'd stuff / As well might poison poison!"" (line 126) is thought to refer to the sweating treatment given to people suffering from venereal disease. Note that he also tries to set Imogen against Posthumus by accusing Posthumus of going whoring on her money, a continuation the theme of buying and selling.
	Iachimo's dedication of himself to Imogen's ""sweet pleasure"" may be taken to mean he will do what she wishes by way of helping her take revenge, or may be a seduction attempt. Probably, it carries both meanings. His mind constantly runs along animalistic and sexual tracks, debasing the love relationship between Posthumus and Imogen.
	The rapidity with which Iachimo changes track once Imogen sees through him, and appeals to her naturally open nature, indicates his great skill in manipulating people. Imogen's willingness to forgive Iachimo contrasts markedly with her father's failure to forgive her for marrying against his wishes.

	Cloten is playing bowls with some Lords and losing. A Lord asks Cloten if he knows of the Italian visitor to court, Iachimo, a friend of Posthumus's. Cloten does not, and goes to seek him out. The Second Lord, left alone, marvels ""That such a crafty devil as is his mother / Should yield the world this ass!"" (lines 54-5). She is a woman who ""Bears all down with her brain,"" whereas Cloten cannot take two from twenty. The Lord pities Imogen for her unhappy position between her father ruled by her stepmother, the stepmother ""hourly coining plots"" (line 61), and a hateful suitor who wants to divorce her from her husband. He prays that Imogen holds firm.
	Analysis
	This scene adds little to the action of the play, and much of the dialogue is of poor quality, leading some critics to suspect that it is not Shakespeare's but has been interpolated by an unknown hand. Its main function seems to be to further expose Cloten's unrefined nature, to compare his stupidity with his mother's cunning, and to establish that he did not know of Iachimo's presence at court.
",Cymbeline
277,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 2,"Summary
	The scene is set in Imogen's bedroom. Iachimo's trunk is placed in it. After she goes to sleep, Iachimo emerges from the trunk. He is tempted by her beauty, but resists the urge to touch and kiss her. His plan is to note details of the room and identifying marks on her body, in order to convince Posthumus that he has succeeded in seducing her. He removes her bracelet, the parting gift from her husband, which he says will help in the ""madding"" of Posthumus (line 37). He also notes a mole on her left breast. When he feels he has enough evidence, he gets back into the trunk.
	Analysis
	The atmosphere of sexual menace in this scene is palpable. Iachimo, leaning over the sleeping and defenseless Imogen and noting the intimate details of her body, is committing a kind of rape, a psychological violation of the marriage between her and Posthumus. This notion is reinforced by the book she has been reading (probably Ovid's Metamorphoses), which tells of treason and rape. Iachimo appears to liken himself to a raven (line 49), a continuation of the predator and prey imagery that runs through the play. His line ""Though this is a heavenly angel, hell is here"" (line 50) leaves no doubt as to the depraved state of Iachimo's soul as compared with that of Imogen.

	Cloten is playing some Lords, either at dice or cards, and losing again. Some musicians enter; Cloten has employed them to serenade Imogen, which they do.
	The King and Queen enter. Cymbeline inquires whether Imogen has come out of her room. When Cloten says she has not, Cymbeline says that in time, Imogen will forget Posthumus and then she will be Cloten's. The Queen advises him to obey Imogen in everything except when she sends him away.
	A messenger announces that some ambassadors from Rome, including one called Lucius, have arrived. Cymbeline knows that Rome is angry with him, but he will receive Lucius, who is a worthy man, according to the honor of the Emperor. He asks Cloten to greet Imogen and then to follow him and the Queen to meet the Roman.
	Cloten, left alone, plans to bribe one of Imogen's ladies to buy access to her. Gold can do anything, he says, even have an honest man killed and save a thief.
	He knocks at Imogen's door. A Lady emerges, and Cloten offers her gold to speak for him. Imogen enters. She tells Cloten that she does not care for him, and indeed, she hates him. Cloten says she owes her father obedience. Because of her royal status, she does not have free choice and cannot marry a ""base slave."" Imogen angrily defends her husband, saying that Cloten, even if he were the god Jupiter's son, would be ""too base / To be his groom"" (lines 127-8).
	Imogen calls Pisanio and send him to ask one of her ladies to search for her bracelet. She is sure that she had it last night, because she kissed it.
	Cloten is offended by Imogen's statement that Posthumus's ""meanest garment"" is dearer to her than Cloten, and threatens to tell her father. Imogen suggests he tell the Queen too, and is in no doubt that she will think the worst of her. Cloten vows revenge.
	Analysis
	Cloten employs lewd imagery when talking of Imogen (lines 14-15): ""penetrate,"" ""fingering"" and ""try with tongue too"" are ostensibly about music but have sexual double meanings. The delicate song that follows Cloten's lewd speech, ""Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings, / And Phoebus gins arise,"" reflects the split between the superficially civilized surface and the brutally vulgar. The inappropriateness of Cloten's attitude to Imogen is underscored by his own reference to her ladies as ""Diana's rangers"" (line 70), Diana being the goddess of chastity.
	Cloten's plan to use gold to bribe Imogen's ladies is significant, as Imogen has previously (Act 1, scene 2, line 74) used the imagery of gold to convey the true worth of Posthumus. Gold is traditionally seen as the incorruptible metal, as it does not tarnish, but Cloten wants to use it to corrupt innocence.
	There is profound irony in Imogen's hope that her bracelet has not gone to tell Posthumus that she is kissing something or someone other than him, since we know, where Imogen does not, that Iachimo plans to use this bracelet as proof that she is unfaithful.
	Imogen's steadfastness comes across in this scene, as she fearlessly defends herself and Posthumus against Cloten's onslaught.

Summary
	In Rome, Posthumus tells Philario he is sure of Imogen's honor, but has less confidence that he will win over the King. He is leaving it to time. In his exiled state, he regrets he cannot repay Philario for his generosity. But Philario says that Posthumus's goodness and company are payment enough. Besides, he is confident that Lucius, Augustus Caesar's ambassador, will by now have extracted the tribute arrears that he went to collect from Cymbeline. If Cymbeline does not pay up, he will face a Roman invasion.
	Posthumus believes that Cymbeline will not pay and that there will be war. He points out that the Britons are more skilled in war than they were in Julius Caesar's day, when the Roman invaders defeated them.
	Iachimo enters, commends Imogen's beauty to Posthumus, and gives him letters from her. Posthumus asks Iachimo whether his diamond still sparkles as brightly, or is dimmed by Imogen's betrayal. Iachimo replies that he has won the ring, for he enjoyed a night with the ""easy"" Imogen. Posthumus, reluctant to believe Iachimo, warns him not to joke about his losing the bet, and reminds him that they shall not remain friends. Iachimo answers that they will remain friends, since he has defeated Imogen's honor and not wronged her or Posthumus-both were willing participants.
	Posthumus asks for proof that he has ""tasted her in bed"" (line 57). Iachimo describes the furnishings of Imogen's bedroom, the carvings over the fireplace, and even the fire-irons, but Posthumus says he could have heard this from someone else.
	Finally, Iachimo shows Posthumus Imogen's bracelet that he stole from her as she slept. He says it matches the diamond, so both must be his. He claims that Imogen gave it to him, saying ""she priz'd it once"" (line 104). Posthumus suggests that maybe she took it off to send it to him, but Iachimo asks if she says that in her letter, which, of course, she does not.
	Posthumus now believes Iachimo. He takes off his ring, which he says has become a basilisk to his eye (a basilisk was a mythical reptile whose glance was thought to be fatal). He rails against the falseness of women underneath their outward beauty, and the worthlessness of their vows.
	Philario counsels him to be patient and take back his ring, as there is no proof that Imogen is unfaithful. It could be that she lost the bracelet, or that one of her ladies stole it.
	Posthumus agrees, and asks for his ring back from Iachimo. He now wants Iachimo to cite some distinguishing feature on Imogen's body as proof. Iachimo swears by Jupiter that he had it from her arm, which again convinces Posthumus that his wife is unfaithful. He is sure she would not lose it, and her ladies are honorable. Posthumus is once more convinced that she has been unfaithful, and gives the ring back to Iachimo. Philario warns him again that the evidence is not strong enough to convince. But Iachimo describes the mole under Imogen's breast, which he says he kissed. Posthumus says that this ""stain"" confirms another-on her character-""as big as hell can hold"" (line 140).
	Posthumus erupts in fury and threatens to tear Imogen limb from limb in front of her father. Philario and Iachimo follow him out to prevent him from harming himself.
	Posthumus re-enters and delivers a soliloquy against women. He regrets that men need them at all, and says all men are bastards: even he does not know where his father was when he was conceived. His mother seemed chaste, but then so does his wife. He attributes all vices in men to the feminine aspect or ""woman's part"" (line 174): lying, deceiving, ambition, and so on. Even to vice, he says, they are not constant, but ever changing.
	Analysis
	Posthumus uses the imagery of the seasons in his hope that the King will be won over to his marriage. Now, he quakes in the wintry cold of the King's displeasure, but wishes for warmer days (lines 5-6).
	Having failed to persuade Imogen to betray her marriage to Posthumus, Iachimo attempts to persuade Posthumus to betray Imogen, by believing that she is faithless.
	Once again, Iachimo chooses his words for maximum emotional impact. He describes the hangings in Imogen's room as telling the story of Antony and Cleopatra (line 70). Just as Antony was Cleopatra's Roman, hints Iachimo, so was he Imogen's.
	Posthumus's surrender to Iachimo's slanders is marked by his sudden inability to distinguish between appearance and reality. He believes that he is at last seeing the truth when he paints Imogen as being outwardly beautiful but inwardly deceitful. In fact, we know that she is beautiful both inside and out, as was Posthumus prior to his corruption by Iachimo. Posthumus's vision has become delusional.
	There is a contrast between Posthumus's delusion and Cymbeline's. Posthumus's wife is honest but he thinks her false; and Cymbeline's wife is deceitful but he chooses to assume that she is honest. Imogen is the only major character who sees everyone as they are. Yet she suffers cruelly as the victim of others' delusions and dishonesty.
	While Posthumus is undoubtedly a victim of Iachimo's evil, it is clear that he is also a flawed character whose one weakness-an insecurity over his wife's fidelity-is exploited. It is ironic that he is more ready to believe in the incorruptible honor of Imogen's ladies (line 125) than in that of his wife.
	Posthumus takes on board Iachimo's imagery of hell (Act 2, scene 3, line 50) when he refers to Imogen's mole being a stain ""as big as hell can hold"" (Act 2, scene 4, line 140). His final soliloquy against women is as shocking as it is unjust, and must strain the audience's sympathy with him.

280,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"Summary
	At Cymbeline's palace, Lucius is asking Cymbeline to honor the three thousand pounds a year tribute agreed with Cymbeline's uncle when Julius Caesar conquered Britain. The Queen says it will never be paid. Cloten adds that it is unlikely that there will be another Caesar like Julius; Britain is ""a world by itself,"" and its people will not pay ""for wearing our own noses."" The Queen urges the King not to pay, on the grounds that Britain is a natural fortress, protected by the sea on all sides, and even Julius Caesar was twice defeated before his final victory over the Britons. Cloten says that Britain is stronger than it was at that time. Unless Caesar ""can hide the sun from us with a blanket"", in which case Britons would pay him a tribute for light, they do not see why they should pay. Cymbeline says that Julius Caesar's ambition enabled him to dominate Britain, but it befits a warlike people to throw off the yoke.
	Lucius, on behalf of Augustus Caesar, declares war on Britain.
	Analysis
	Confirming the Queen's earlier statement that she is always able to win the King to her way of thinking, Cymbeline takes a back seat to the Queen in the talks with Lucius, at one point asking Cloten to stop talking and let her finish. This would have been seen as an unnatural departure from the proper order in Shakespeare's time, because Cymbeline is the sovereign monarch and because he is male. In spite of the fact that England was then being ruled by a woman (Elizabeth I), it was generally believed that men, not women, were created to govern countries, and that within a marriage, men should govern their wives.
	Even Cloten speaks more forcefully in this scene than Cymbeline. The fact that it is the Queen and her unintelligent son who are leading the opposition to the Romans does not inspire confidence in the outcome of the war.

281,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 2,"Summary
	Pisanio is reading a letter from Posthumus revealing that he accuses Imogen of adultery. A liar has prevailed over Posthumus's ""too ready hearing,"" and Imogen is ""punish'd for her truth"" (lines 6-7). Pisanio observes that Posthumus's mind, compared with Imogen, has sunk to the level of his fortune.
	Posthumus asks Pisanio to murder Imogen. He shall have the opportunity when he delivers a letter to her. If to do so is to do good service, says Pisanio, then he shall not be counted a good servant; he will disobey the order and not tell Imogen of it.
	Imogen enters and Pisanio gives her a letter from Posthumus, which she reads. He writes that he will brave her father's wrath in order to be restored by seeing her. He is at Milford Haven, and hints that she must follow her heart's prompting (presumably, to go there). Imogen is immediately excited by the thought of going to see Posthumus, and asks how long it will take to ride there. Pisanio is less enthusiastic, because he fears that she is riding to her destruction. But she insists that the only way forward for her is to go to Milford Haven and Posthumus.
	Analysis
	Pisanio uses the imagery of disease (""strange infection"") and poison to express Posthumus's unwarranted jealousy (lines 3, 5). But he makes clear that Posthumus's being a victim of such onslaughts does not absolve him of responsibility: Iachimo has simply ""prevail'd / On thy too ready hearing"" (lines 5-6).
	Pisanio has followed Cornelius in disobeying his master for a virtuous purpose. Both Posthumus and the Queen have divorced themselves from truth, and in such cases, the true servant must prevent them from doing evil, if necessary by disobeying orders.
",Cymbeline
282,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 3,"Summary
	The scene shifts to a cave in Wales, where Belarius, a banished Lord, is out hunting with his adopted sons. These are, in fact, Cymbeline's lost sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, though they are going under the names of Polydore and Cadwal.
	Belarius contrasts the pride and vanity of the court with the poorer but ""nobler"" (line 22) life they have had to adopt. The humble beetle, he says, lives safer than the grand eagle. At the court, people are reliant on others for approval and live in debt to their tailors. Guiderius points out that while Belarius has the luxury of comparing the two lifestyles, he and his brother do not, since they have never been away from this place. To them, the cave is merely a ""cell of ignorance"" (line 33) and a prison. Arviragus adds that unlike Belarius, they will have no tales to tell when they grow as old as him: they have seen nothing, and are like foxes or wolves, concerned only with hunting their next meal. The only courage they need is to ""chase what flies"" (line 42), a cowardly sort of valor.
	Belarius tells them that there is nothing to be desired in the life of the court, where a climb to the peak of favor will be followed by a fall into disgrace, and where the fear of falling is as bad as the fact. Honorable acts are often punished, and what is worse, you must bow (""court'sey"") in thanks for such treatment. He himself was once loved by Cymbeline, but overnight, he lost favor after being slandered by two false villains. They told Cymbeline he was collaborating with the Romans, and he was banished.
	He promises his adopted sons that the first to hit a deer shall be lord of the feast and that the others will serve him. And, he says, he will fear no poison, which is an occupational hazard at court.
	After the boys leave, Belarius muses how difficult it is to hide ""the sparks of Nature"" (line 79) inherent in the sons of a king. This is in spite of the fact that they have not been told of their royal birth (believing that they are Belarius's sons), and that Cymbeline is unaware that they are alive. When Belarius tells Guiderius, heir to Cymbeline, of his warlike feats, the boy acts out his words and ""The princely blood flows in his cheek"" (line 93).
	Belarius, who goes under the name of Morgan, says that Cymbeline banished him unjustly. In revenge, he stole the royal children in order to deprive the king of his heirs, just as he had been deprived of his lands. But now, ""the game is up,"" by which he probably means that the pretence cannot be kept up any longer.
	Analysis
	Belarius contrasts the low door of his cave, where his exiled family must bow their heads as if to worship the heavens, with the high gates of monarchs, where giants can strut through, keeping their turbans on. He is symbolically making the point that the court is a place of pride, whereas they have learned humility. But paradoxically, their life is nobler than a court life, which is marked by dependence, debt and vanity.
	However, this scene offers a twist on the conventional view of country life offered by Romance plays. It may be more innocent and less corrupt than court life, but to Guiderius and Arviragus, it is as limiting as a prison and as bestial as the existence of a wolf or a fox.
	In comparing himself and his brother to baby birds who have never flown the nest (lines 26-7), Guiderius continues the imagery of birds that permeates the play. Posthumus is represented as an eagle in Act 1, scene 2; and Iachimo, in Act 1, scene 7, calls Imogen ""alone th' Arabian bird,"" a reference to the legendary Phoenix. The Phoenix is said to have risen from its own ashes, out of the fire which burned at the top of the sacred Persea Tree at Heliopolis. It was a symbol of the rising sun and of the dead Sun-god, Osiris, from whom it sprang, and to whom it was sacred. The image foreshadows Imogen's later 'rebirth' from her seeming death.
	Belarius's story of how he fell from favor as a result of slanders echoes Imogen's fall from Posthumus's favor as a result of Iachimo's lies, as well as Posthumus's fall from Cymbeline's favor after he married Imogen.
	The scene illustrates the belief, prevalent in Shakespeare's time, that royal blood cannot be hidden, but will show itself through an inherent nobility of thought and action. Though the roof of his cave is low, the boys' thoughts ""do hit / The roofs of palaces"" (line 83), and they enter into Belarius's war stories in ""princely"" fashion (line 93).
",Cymbeline
283,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 4,"Summary
	Pisanio and Imogen are on their way to Milford Haven to meet Posthumus, as Imogen thinks. Pisanio is disturbed about leading Imogen to her death. When Imogen questions his obvious anxiety, he hands Posthumus's letter to her, in which Posthumus orders him to kill Imogen at Milford Haven for her proven adultery. Imogen asks what it means to be false to his bed: to think of him all the time, and be awakened by frightening dreams about the dangers he is in? She realizes that it is Iachimo who has been false; she suspects too that some loose Italian woman has led Posthumus astray. She herself is like a discarded garment, no longer in fashion, that must be ripped to pieces (line 53). Posthumus will bring all good seeming things into disrepute, as if they were pretended for evil purposes.
	She draws Pisanio's sword and orders him to take it and kill her in accordance with Posthumus's order; she asks him to tell Posthumus later of her obedience. Pisanio refuses and tosses the sword aside. She tells him he must obey his master, and she cannot kill herself as suicide is a sin. Imogen's insistence that Pisanio kill her, as suicide is a sin, triggers a series of religious images. She throws away Posthumus's letters as ""heresy"" (line 82); he is one of the ""false teachers"" of heresy (line 85). She points out that her disobedience against her father in marrying Posthumus was very unusual; she is obedient to his order that she die. She feels sad to think how, when he is tired of his new woman, he will miss her. She asks Pisanio not to delay, since both she and Posthumus want her death.
	Pisanio refuses to kill Imogen, and she asks why he has therefore wasted so much time and trouble traveling all these miles. Pisanio answers that he only wanted to win time to find a way out of his situation.
	He is sure that ""some villain"" (line 121) has abused Posthumus into thinking Imogen is unfaithful. Imogen asks whether this could be a Roman courtesan, but Pisanio says no. He plans to announce that Imogen is dead, and to send Posthumus proof of this. He wants Imogen to return to the court, but she is reluctant because Cloten is there. Pisanio says the alternative is to leave the country. Lucius will arrive in Milford Haven tomorrow. Imogen must disguise herself as a man-he has brought male clothing for her-and live near the house where Posthumus is staying, where she can receive reports on what he is doing. She will then present herself to Lucius and ask for a job as his servant. Pisanio will go back to court in case his absence arouses suspicion that he is involved in Imogen's disappearance.
	Pisanio gives Imogen the box that the Queen gave him, telling her it is medicine that will treat sea-sickness or nausea.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of great pathos in which we sympathize with both Imogen and Pisanio. Pisanio tortures himself with his unwillingness to obey Posthumus and kill Imogen. When he shows her the letter from Posthumus, he says he does not need to draw his sword against her, because the paper ""hath cut her throat already"" (line 33), an image that conveys her vulnerability. Imogen is too innocent even to conceive of being false to her husband, as her bitter speech (lines 40-44) reveals.
	However, Imogen's innocence does not mean she is insipid. She defends herself with great passion and fury against Posthumus's slanders. Her condemnation of Posthumus, that his ""revolt"" against his own apparently virtuous nature would make all good seem as if it were put on for villainous purposes, strikes us as a terrifying curse on mankind. Her rapid-fire command to Pisanio, in reply to his admission that he has not slept since he received Posthumus's order to kill her, to ""Do't, and to bed then,"" is extraordinarily ruthless.
	Imogen uses the imagery of the seasons when questioning Pisanio, asking him whether the contents of the letter he hands her are summer (happy) or winter (sad) news (lines 12-13). Pisanio compares the slander against Imogen with snake venom (lines 35, 39). Reprising the play's bird imagery, Imogen believes that a ""jay of Italy"" (line 49) has seduced Posthumus. A jay has brightly colored plumage, and Imogen imagines this loose woman as being painted with make-up (line 50).
	In another reference to Iachimo's symbolic link with hell, Pisanio rejects Imogen's request that he kill her, protesting that his sword shall not ""damn"" his hand (line 74).
	It is difficult to understand why Pisanio is ready to believe the claim of the Queen, whom he does not trust, that the box she gave him contains healing medicines. But the plot requires that Imogen take these potions, so we are expected to gloss over Pisanio's convenient sudden trust in the Queen.

284,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is bidding farewell to Lucius. Lucius says he is sorry that he has to report to his master that Cymbeline is his enemy. Cymbeline explains that the Britons will not endure Caesar's domination, and for the King to show less desire for independence than his subjects would appear ""unkinglike"" (line 7). Cymbeline gives Lucius safe conduct to Milford Haven.
	Cymbeline says that he must prepare the army to fight the Roman forces, which are in Gallia (France) and ready to invade.
	Cymbeline asks the Queen where Imogen is: she has lately had more of a look of malice than of duty towards him. The Queen urges him to treat her gently, and says time will heal. An attendant reveals that the doors to her rooms are locked and their knocks have gone unanswered. The Queen tries to reassure him by explaining that Imogen has asked her to excuse her staying in; she has not been feeling well. The Queen says she forgot to tell him this.
	The King is alarmed, and leaves. Cloten remarks that he has not seen Pisanio either for two days. He follows the King. The Queen, left alone, prays that Pisanio's absence is explained by the fact that he has swallowed her poison. She wonders if Imogen has either killed herself or run after Posthumus; either outcome would suit the Queen, since then her son Cloten would be heir to the throne.
	Cloten re-enters and confirms that Imogen has fled. The King is in a rage. The Queen is secretly pleased, as she hopes that Cymbeline's wrath will prove fatal to him. She exits. Cloten speaks about his feelings for Imogen, saying he loves her for her unrivalled qualities, but hates her for disdaining him and favoring Posthumus. He wants revenge on her.
	Pisanio enters and Cloten aggressively interrogates him as to Imogen's whereabouts. He asks if she is with Posthumus. Pisanio feigns ignorance, saying Posthumus is in Rome so she cannot be with him. Cloten threatens to kill him unless he tells all. Pisanio presents him with a letter (later revealed to be a forgery, in Act 5, scene 5, line 279), seemingly from Posthumus, saying that this is all he knows of her flight. Pisanio is confident that the letter will not put Imogen in danger as she is far away, and hopes it may disconcert Cloten, as it is an apparently loving letter.
	Aside to the audience, Pisanio says he will write to Posthumus saying that Imogen is dead. He prays for her safe return.
	Having read the letter, Cloten offers Pisanio preferment if he will serve him, and do whatever ""villainy"" Cloten asks of him (line 113). Cloten observes that since Pisanio has loyally served the ""beggar"" Posthumus (line 121), he will surely be loyal to him also. Pisanio agrees.
	Cloten asks Pisanio if he has any of Posthumus's clothes, and Pisanio says he has the suit Posthumus wore when he took leave of Imogen. Cloten asks him to fetch the suit. When Pisanio has left, Cloten reveals that he intends to travel to Milford Haven. Because Imogen once said he revered Posthumus's garment more than Cloten, he will put on the suit and ""ravish her"" (line 142), and kill Posthumus in front of her. That way, Imogen will see his ""valour"" to pay her back for her contempt. He wants both to sate his lust (line 146) and to get revenge on her.
	Pisanio apparently overhears some of Cloten's speech, though we are not yet told this. He returns with Posthumus's clothes. Cloten asks him to take them to his room. He then asks Pisanio to be true to him. Pisanio replies that to be true to him would mean being false to that ""true"" man, Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The imagery of buying and selling continues, with Cloten saying Imogen ""outsells"" all other women (line 75) and that Posthumus's base ""weights"" (line 89)-pieces of cheap metal-are worthless. But Cloten reveals once more his bestial nature, threatening to rip Pisanio's heart out (lines 87-8), a wolf-like and predatory image.
	There is irony in Cloten's ordering Pisanio to perform ""villainy"" in his service, which he says will prove him ""honest"" (lines 113-5). This is indicative of the perverted values of the corrupt court that Belarius warned his adopted sons about: the good man is punished, the bad rewarded. Pisanio expands this theme in lines 162-7, where he says that to be true to Cloten would mean being false to Posthumus, whom Pisanio believes is ""true,"" that is, good. This interpretation has been questioned by critics who view Posthumus, after his fall into jealousy, as being far from true. However, it is clear that Pisanio believes Posthumus to be an essentially true man who was abused by a villain.
	In a chilling twist on the outward appearance versus inward reality theme, Cloten will wear Posthumus's garment in an attempt to wreak revenge on Imogen for saying that she valued it above him. He is also attempting to steal some of Posthumus's perceived worth by adopting his garment-a typically superficial act on his part.
	There is a parallel plot theme in Cloten's plan to clothe himself in Posthumus's suit while in the next scene, Imogen appears dressed as a boy. This throws into relief the difference in their motivations: Cloten wishes revenge on Imogen, who he feels has wronged him, whereas Imogen feels only love for Posthumus, who has certainly wronged her. This leads us into one of the grand themes of the Romance plays, forgiveness and reconciliation. A character's redemption or otherwise largely depends upon their ability to forgive and be forgiven.

	In Wales, near Belarius's cave, Imogen enters disguised as a boy. She is lost, has slept rough for two nights, and is on the point of collapse from lack of food. She reflects that to lie when prosperous is a greater crime than to lie out of need, and so falsehood is ""worse in kings than beggars"" (line 14). On this basis, Posthumus is among the false ones.
	She notices Belarius's cave. She fears to make herself known, but starvation gives her courage. She calls out, but receives no answer, so draws her sword and enters the cave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's clear-sightedness is evident in this scene. She does not try to attenuate Posthumus's guilt but recognizes that he is false even as she states her love for him.
	The chance that Imogen should come across the cave where her lost brothers live can strike modern audiences as coincidental to the point of absurdity. But such remarkable happenings, particularly involving lost royal children, are part of the Romance tradition.
	Some modern critics have embraced the magic elements of Romance and placed them within the framework of Jungian psychology, which sees events and characters as different aspects of the Self. In this framework, the aim is to bring to conscious awareness all the 'lost' aspects of the Self, resulting in unity of life and purpose. Thus, the lost royal children can be seen as representing the youthfulness and energy that the court has lost. They can also represent parts of Imogen's scattered self. She has been rejected or abused by the major male figures in her life, and to be embraced by her brothers must come as a healing experience.

	Belarius congratulates Guiderius for being most successful in the hunt, and names him as master of the feast. Arviragus and he will play cook and servant. The boys are both weary. Belarius notices Imogen in the cave, and remarks that if she were not eating their food, he would think her a fairy. He next thinks that she is an angel.
	Imogen explains that she has stolen nothing and was going to leave them money for what she has eaten. Guiderius is not impressed, as gold and silver ""turn to dirt"" (line 26), and is only admired by those ""who worship dirty gods"" (line 28). Imogen tells him that had she not helped herself to the food, she would have died of starvation. She tells them she is going to Milford Haven and gives her name as Fidele, which means 'faithful' in French. She says a relative of hers has just embarked at Milford for Italy.
	Belarius bids her welcome, asking her not to measure their minds by the ""rude"" place they live in (line 38). Guiderius seems to feel an attraction towards her, saying her would court her if she were a woman. Arviragus welcomes her as a friend. Aside to the audience, she wishes they had been her brothers, for then she would not have been Cymbeline's sole heir, and Posthumus would have been more her financial equal. The boys notice her distress and sympathize with her.
	Imogen reflects that great men could not surpass the two boys. She would change her sex to be their companion, since Posthumus has proved false.
	Belarius invites her to tell as much of her story as she wishes, after they have eaten.
	Analysis
	'Magic sleep' is one of the themes of the Romance plays. It generally marks some transformative change in the characters' lives. It is significant that both Imogen and the lost royal sons arrive at the cave very tired. The mood is heightened by Belarius's first impression of Imogen, that she is a fairy, and his second, that she is an angel.
	Imogen wishes that she had been poorer and offered ""more equal ballasting"" with Posthumus uses another image of weight and worth, this time to express the balance of power in her relationship (line 50).

	Imogen is still disguised as a boy.
	Belarius notices that Imogen/Fidele is not well and asks her to stay in the cave while he and the boys go hunting. Arviragus addresses her as ""brother"". This has an ironic ring for the audience, which knows that he is Imogen's brother, but not for the characters themselves, who do not know they are related and think it a mere expression of friendship. Guiderius offers to stay with her, but she insists that he go, since she does not want to socialize and he cannot cure her by staying.
	Guiderius tells Imogen/Fidele that he loves her as he does his father, though he does not know why. Arviragus says he also loves Imogen, to the extent that, if one among them had to die, he would choose Belarius rather than her. Belarius is not offended by this, taking it as a sign of the youth's inherent nobility that he has noticed something special about Imogen.
	Aside to the audience, Imogen/Fidele reflects on the kindness of her hosts, and says that she has been lied to at court, where it is said that everyone outside that place is a savage. Her sickness, she says, is a heart-sickness (for love of Posthumus). She takes the drug that Pisanio has given her.
	Guiderius tells his brother that he could not persuade the youth to tell 'his' story. All 'he' would say was that he was well-born, but unfortunate, the victim of dishonesty, but honest. He told Arviragus that he might learn more in future. Imogen retires into the cave.
	Belarius comments that the youth evidently has ""good ancestors"" (line 48). Arviragus is struck by his ""angel-like"" singing voice (line 48), and Guiderius by his exquisite cooking skills.
	Cloten enters. He is upset that he has not found Imogen and Posthumus, and suspects that Pisanio has tricked him by giving him wrong directions. He too feels faint.
	Belarius recognizes Cloten as the son of the Queen. Belarius and the boys are viewed as outlaws, and Belarius thinks they should escape. Guiderius decides to stay with Cloten and suggests that Belarius and Arviragus go to search for any followers. Cloten challenges them as they flee and Guiderius is left to answer Cloten, whom he calls a ""slave""-a term of abuse. Cloten calls Guiderius a law-breaker and demands that he yield. Guiderius asks why he should. Cloten replies, by his clothes-he may mean that they show he is from the court. Cloten tries to provoke Guiderius with insults, but Guiderius does not rise to the bait because he sees that Cloten is a fool. Cloten tells Guiderius his name, thinking that will make him tremble in awe. But Guiderius says he would be more fearful of something with the name of toad, adder or spider, that is, something that can harm him (it was thought toads were venomous). Cloten tries again, saying he is the Queen's son, but Guiderius says he only regrets that he does not seem worthy of this high position.
	Cloten wants Guiderius to fear him, but Guiderius is unmoved, saying that he fears (respects) only those whom he reverences; he laughs at fools. They leave, fighting.
	Belarius and Arviragus return, without having found any followers of Cloten. Guiderius comes in carrying Cloten's head. He says that had he not killed Cloten, Cloten would have killed him. Belarius is horrified, but Guiderius is unrepentant. He says the law does not protect them, so why should they allow ""an arrogant piece of flesh"" (line 127), who usurps the role of judge and executioner, threaten them just because they fear the law?
	Belarius says that though he saw no one else, Cloten must have some attendants, whom Belarius fears. He may have come on a dare, to bring the runaway outlaws back, but it is still unlikely that he would come alone.
	Arviragus is philosophical, saying that they must accept their fate and that his brother has done well. Guiderius says he killed Cloten with his own sword and plans to throw his head into the river, whence it will be carried out to sea. He will tell the fishes that this is the Queen's son: this is the extent of his care for Cloten.
	Belarius fears the deed will be revenged, and wishes Guiderius had not done it. Arviragus wishes that he himself had done it, so that the revenge would pursue him. Belarius warns them not to seek danger where there is no profit.
	Belarius reflects that the boys' behavior shows an inherent royal-ness, which they did not need to be taught. He wonders what Cloten's visit will bring in its wake.
	Guiderius enters to report that he has thrown Cloten's head into the stream. They are interrupted by the sound of solemn music played on Belarius's instrument. Arviragus is the one who generally plays this instrument, but he has not played it since their mother's death. Guiderius wonders what solemn occasion merits its use.
	Arviragus enters with Imogen, seemingly dead, in his arms. He makes an elaborate speech, noting all the different flowers he will plant on her grave. The more practical Guiderius cuts him short, saying that they should bury Imogen near to their mother. Arviragus wants to sing the same dirge that they sang to their mother, but Guiderius says he will not be able to sing for weeping.
	Belarius reminds them that they must also bury Cloten, and with royal honors, since he was the son of a queen. Guiderius asks him to fetch the body, though he comments that when dead, a poor person's body is as good as a powerful person's.
	Guiderius sings the dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (line 258), which deals with the mutability of all things, which must ""come to dust"".
	After Belarius and the boys leave, Imogen awakes from her drugged sleep in a delirious state. She is shocked into clarity by the sight of Cloten's headless body next to her, dressed in Posthumus's clothes. She hopes that she is dreaming. But when it becomes clear that she is not, she is convinced that Pisanio has conspired with Cloten to murder Posthumus. The fact that Pisanio gave her a drug that proved ""murd'rous to the senses"" (line 328) confirms his malice. Imogen falls on the body of Cloten.
	Lucius enters with some of his captains and a Soothsayer. A Captain reports that the troops that were stationed in Gallia are now at Milford Haven and ready to fight. The ""gentlemen"" of Italy, commanded by Iachimo, are also sailing for Britain at the next favorable wind. Lucius gives the order to muster the existing troops, then asks the Soothsayer what he has dreamed regarding the war. He replies that he saw Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards and disappearing into the beams of the sun, which means Rome will be victorious.
	Lucius finds the bodies of Imogen and Cloten. The Captain says Imogen is alive. Lucius asks Imogen to explain what has happened, the identity of the headless man, and her interest in him. Imogen, still adopting the persona of Fidele, describes the body as her master, killed by brigands. She laments that she will never find another to equal him. She says his name is Richard du Champ and that her name is Fidele. Lucius says her name fits her faith, and invites her to enter his service. Imogen agrees, and Lucius bids her be cheerful, as ""Some falls are means the happier to arise"" (line 403). Lucius and his men go to dig Cloten a grave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's taking of the drug is another hint, along with the previous references to sleepiness, that a transformation in awareness is about to happen. The regenerative theme is invoked in Arviragus' description of patience and grief as two plants which have taken root in Imogen, and his prayer that the first thrives while the second withers.
	Cloten's insistence that Guiderius should know who he is by his clothes shows the excessive importance Cloten gives to appearance over inner identity. Guiderius recognizes Cloten's foolishness for thinking that the borrowed clothes ""make"" him (line 83). It should be the other way around: men make clothes.
	The contrast between the true world of the Welsh countryside and the false world of the court is clear in the fact that in the country, Cloten's and the Queen's names and high rank fail to strike awe into anyone's heart; venomous beasts, on the other hand, can do harm and are feared. The appearance versus reality theme is picked up again in Guiderius' comment that Cloten does not seem worthy of such high birth. Note the deliberate contrast between Cloten, who constantly expected respect on the basis of his superficial rank, but inwardly did not deserve it, and Guiderius, who is outwardly a poor outlaw but who exemplifies princely and noble behavior.
	This appearance versus reality theme plays into that of worth. Guiderius, after killing Cloten, calls him a worthless ""empty purse"" with no money in it (lines 113-4). After Guiderius has cut off Cloten's head, Belarius fears that ""the body hath a tail / More perilous than the head."" This grotesque image brings home Cloten's bestial nature and is an outward expression of his inward state-all animal appetite with little of the higher reason that in Renaissance thought separated men from beasts.
	Guiderius' quip that he will tell the fishes that the head he has thrown into the sea is that of the Queen's son represents Cloten stripped of his much-vaunted nobility and reduced to the base level of food for beasts. This image strips away the sophisticated but false veneer behind which the court has hidden its moral decay. The headless corpse is symbolic too of the kingdom under Cymbeline: he is a weak king ruled by his wife. The entire episode of Guiderius's killing of Cloten has an oddly fable-like quality. It is presented more as a story of a noble knight killing a monster than how it would be seen in a more realistic play-the murder of the heir to the throne on what appears to be trivial provocation.
	Belarius likens the two boys to nature herself. He compares their gentleness to a breeze that leaves the violet unmoved, and their roughness to the strongest wind that can bend a tree. He says that though they have never been taught royal behavior and valor, it grows in them as a wild (i.e. not deliberately cultivated) crop. This is another example of the theme of inherent royalty or nobility.
	The dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (lines 258-81), is perhaps the best known part of the play. It draws upon the theme of gold and worth, and sets them in the context of the mutability of all things: even ""golden lads and girls,"" those most valued in life, must eventually come to dust, as surely as do chimney sweeps. Death is the great leveler, and makes the ""frown o' th' great,"" ""slander"" and the ""tyrant's stoke,"" as well as mankind's great achievements in the field of learning and lovers' passion, irrelevant.
	Coming so soon after Arviragus' lyrical speech about the flowers he will plant on Imogen's grave, this song has the effect of measuring the world that man constructs for himself and identifies so strongly with, but which all ends in dust, against the great creative force of nature, which endlessly generates new life.
	Belarius's comment about dewy herbs being fittest for graves recalls the Queen's sinister words in Act 1, scene 6.
	Imogen's invocation of a drop of pity as small as ""a wren's eye"" (line 305) represents another bird image, part of the theme of regenerative nature. Another example of the bird theme is the soothsayer's dream of Rome's victory in battle as Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards (line 348).
",Cymbeline
290,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 3,"Summary
	Cymbeline asks how his wife is. She has run mad with a fever at Cloten's absence, and her life is in danger. The King is forlorn at the loss of Imogen and the possible loss of the Queen, as well as the absence of Cloten at a time when a frightening war looms. He believes Pisanio knows something about Imogen's departure, and threatens to torture him until he reveals it. Pisanio counters that he knows nothing, but asserts his loyalty to the King.
	The First Lord backs up Pisanio, saying that the day she went missing, he was at court. There is a search party looking for Cloten. The King lets Pisanio off the hook for now. The First Lord tells the King that the Roman forces have landed, together with the Roman gentlemen sent by the Senate. He reassures the King that the British forces are ready. Cymbeline longs for the advice of Cloten and the Queen. The King and courtiers leave Pisanio alone.
	Pisanio worries that he has not heard from Posthumus since he wrote telling him that Imogen had been killed. Nor has he heard from Imogen or anything of Cloten. Pisanio repeats that he is only false in order to be honest; and the wars shall prove he loves his country.
	Analysis
	This scene is unique in that it pushes Cymbeline into the foreground. But he only emphasizes his unkingly nature by lamenting his comfortless state, with his daughter, wife and Cloten all unavailable to him at a time when he is nervous about the war. Cymbeline's uncertain nature compares unfavorably with the youthful bravery of his lost sons, which features prominently in the next scene.
",Cymbeline
291,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 4,"Summary
	Guiderius notes that he, his brother, and Belarius are in danger from the Romans. Belarius suggests they retreat higher into the mountains. He says that because of Cloten's killing, they cannot go for protection to the King. If they are caught, they will be tortured and killed. Arviragus thinks that the King will be too busy with the war to look into their origins, but Belarius points out that he is well known in the army, and besides, the King has not deserved their service or love.
	But Guiderius and Arviragus believe that they should all go to fight in the wars. Guiderius says he and his brother are not known by anyone at court, and Belarius is forgotten and ""o'ergrown"" (line 33), possibly meaning bearded and unrecognizable, or simply grown out of their thoughts. Guiderius and Arviragus ask for Belarius's blessing to go to war. Belarius replies that since they value their young lives so slightly, there is no reason why he should set more value on his old one. He joins them as they go off to fight.
	Analysis
	The courage of Guiderius and Arviragus, contrasted with Cymbeline's lack of kingly valor in the previous scene, leaves no doubt that it is time for a regime change. Shakespeare's plays uphold the divinely ordained nature of kingship; thus, those who kill, depose or usurp a rightful king must always pay a price. But running alongside this is the idea that kingship is part of the great cycle of nature, in which old, sick and decaying branches wither and die, to be replaced by young, vigorous growth. Cymbeline is the decayed king, while his lost sons, nurtured in the womb of the wild Welsh countryside, are now ripe to assume royal roles.
",Cymbeline
292,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 1,"Summary
	Posthumus is now at the Roman camp in Britain, having joined the Roman forces. He carries with him a bloodstained cloth, sent to him by Pisanio (Act 3, scene 4, line 126) as proof of Imogen's murder. He repents that he had Imogen killed (as he believes), a wife better than himself, for straying just a little. In an example of dramatic irony (where the audience knows what the characters on stage do not), he wishes that Pisanio had obeyed only his just commands, and that the gods had saved Imogen and struck him with more vengeance. Though he has come to Britain to fight against his wife's kingdom, he feels this to be wrong-he has done enough by killing Imogen and will give no wound to her country. He plans to replace his Roman clothes with those of a British peasant, and fight with the Britons against the Romans.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's penitence is somewhat unsatisfying and fails to command much sympathy. He regrets ordering Imogen's killing, but still believes she is guilty. Thus, though he has recovered some sense of perspective regarding her alleged sin, he fails to give her the trust she deserves.
	As we have seen with Imogen, the shedding and adoption of clothing can carry symbolic weight. Posthumus's decision to shed his Roman soldier's clothes and adopt a British peasant's clothing carries many meanings: his attempt to make amends to Imogen and Britain; his abandonment of attempts to control and punish others and willingness to surrender to his fate; and his penitent attempt to replace impressive clothing with inward worth. He will show more valor than his garments suggest, fight as an unknown soldier without the benefit of his martial reputation, and ""begin / To fashion less without, and more within"" (lines 32-3).
	Note the confusion of roles adopted by Posthumus and Imogen. Imogen, a Briton, has disguised herself as a boy and is serving the commander of the Roman army. Posthumus, another Briton, has been exiled to Rome, is supposed to be serving in the Roman army, and arrived in Britain dressed as a Roman, but has secretly defected to the British cause and is now dressed as a poor Briton. Both characters will, in their disguised roles, find a deeper inner truth than they previously knew.
",Cymbeline
293,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 2,"Summary
	Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army enter at one side of the stage, and the British army at another, with Posthumus following, dressed as a poor soldier. There is a skirmish between Iachimo and Posthumus, who disarms Iachimo and leaves. Iachimo, left alone, is penitent that he slandered Imogen, the princess of Britain, and says that his guilt is robbing him of his courage. Otherwise, how could this poor soldier have subdued him, a professional soldier?
	The battle continues. The Britons retreat in disarray and panic, and Cymbeline is taken prisoner. Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus enter and, helped by Posthumus, rescue Cymbeline. Then Lucius, Iachimo and Imogen enter. Lucius sends Imogen away from the fighting, for her safety. Iachimo warns Lucius that the British are bringing in reinforcements. Lucius says they too must bring in more troops, or retreat.
	Analysis
	Coming fast on the heels of Posthumus' penitence is Iachimo's. Both are perhaps less rewarding and dramatic than they should be, since we do not see the journey that led them to this point.
	The decay into which Cymbeline's kingdom has fallen is clear from the shameful disorder into which his army descends. The fact that his lost sons become his rescuer emphasizes the regenerative theme of the new world redeeming the old. The cure for the court's and the nation's sickness lies in the sons' hands. Belarius's involvement is satisfying, since it expiates his sin of stealing the royal children: he heals where once he wounded.
",Cymbeline
294,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 3,"Summary
	Posthumus is talking to a British Lord, who fled the battle. Posthumus says there is no shame in this, since all seemed lost for the Britons, until the gods intervened. He tells the Lord how an old man and two boys-obviously Belarius, Arviragus and Guiderius-turned the battle around by stopping the Britons from fleeing and making them fight the Romans. The Romans are defeated, and Lucius has been taken prisoner.
	Posthumus, disappointed that he did not die in battle, has dressed again in Roman clothing. He comes forward and gives himself up to the Britons, wishing to be taken prisoner and put to death. They capture him and plan to take him to the King.
	Analysis
	Posthumus commands more sympathy in this scene than previously. Giving himself up to the Britons to be put to death is arguably a just punishment for his actions.
	Cymbeline, in another bird image, is compared to a bird without wings (line 5); the Romans are like a predatory animal, ""Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring"" (line 8). However, the Britons win because the gods help them (""the heavens fought"" (line 4). This is one of the play's most notable instances of supernatural intervention-though it is dramatically unconvincing, as is confirmed by the Lord's reaction to Posthumus's account of it-and gives a foretaste of the elements that will follow in the next scene.
",Cymbeline
295,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 4,"Summary
	Posthumus enters in chains, with his jailers. They leave him alone, whereupon he explains that he welcomes his bondage, as it is for him the way to freedom (death). He says his conscience is more of a prisoner than his body, and asks the gods to give him the ""penitent instrument"" (line 10) to pick this lock, setting him free forever. He feels that volunteering to be put into chains is the best way. He asks the gods to take his life for Imogen's, though ""'Tis not so dear"" (line 23).
	He falls asleep. Solemn music sounds to signal the scene of Posthumus's dream. A group of spirits, Posthumus's ancestors and dead brothers, gather round him. They beg Jupiter, king of the gods, to intervene and help Posthumus. Jupiter descends on an eagle, and throws a thunderbolt. The spirits fall upon their knees. Jupiter is annoyed with them, but promises that he will uplift Posthumus's fortunes and that Posthumus will be reunited with Imogen.
	Posthumus awakens, bitterly disappointed that his relatives have vanished. He finds a book on the ground, and hopes that the contents are worthy of the cover. He opens the book and reads a cryptic prophecy. It predicts that when a lion's whelp (Posthumus Leonatus) shall be embraced by ""a piece of tender air"" (Imogen), and when branches shall be lopped from a dead cedar (Cymbeline having lost his sons), but which shall later revive (restoration of the lost sons), then Posthumus shall be happy and Britain shall flourish.
	Posthumus does not fully understand the prophecy, but feels it bears some likeness to his life, and so keeps it.
	The jailers return and tell Posthumus that he shall be hanged. He says he is more than ready. The First Gaoler, with mordant humor, comforts him with the news that he needs fear no more tavern bills: he who dies pays all debts. The Gaoler reflects that he has never seen a person who is so eager to be hanged as Posthumus. He wishes that everyone were good, so that there would be no more gaolers or gallows. Though this would deprive him of his present job, he would hope for a better one.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's opening lines carry an emotional power that is lacking in his earlier speeches. His request to the gods that they take him in payment for Imogen's death, coupled with his certainty that he is worth less than she, is full of pathos.
	The dream scene has perhaps attracted more criticism than anything else by Shakespeare. It is written in poor quality doggerel verse, serves no dramatic purpose, and its style and language bear little relation to Shakespeare's other work, leading to doubts that it is his. The character Jupiter has been called ""preposterous"" and indeed, it is difficult to play this scene without arousing laughter of the wrong sort. It is possible that it was later interpolated-by Shakespeare or another writer - for a performance at the court of King James I, where elaborate masques involving gods, painted scenery and 'flying' persons supported by wires were popular. But equally, it may be that it was written by Shakespeare in one of his less inspired moments.
	The scene is an example of a type of stage device which leant a new phrase to the English language: deus ex machina, Latin for, literally, the god from the machine. It originated with Greek and Roman theater, when a machine would lower a god or gods onto the stage to resolve a hopeless situation. The phrase deus ex machina has been extended to refer to any resolution to a story which does not pay regard to the story's internal logic and is so unlikely that it challenges the audience's suspension of disbelief. Its advantage is that it allows authors to end the story in the way they want.
	Posthumus's hope that the book that the spirits leave behind is not merely ""a garment / Nobler than that it covers"" (line 134-5) recalls the theme of appearance versus reality. Symbolically, the book is important, as it marks the crossing-over of the supernatural world into the natural world. It is inevitable that Posthumus's life will be transformed as a result.
",Cymbeline
296,Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is in his tent, surrounded by Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Pisanio. He calls Belarius and the two sons the ""preservers of my throne"" (line 2) and regrets that the ""poor soldier"" who fought so well (Posthumus) cannot be found. Pisanio says that a thorough search has been done but in vain.
	In response to Cymbeline's question, Belarius says that they were born in Cambria (Wales), that they are gentlemen, and that they are honest. Cymbeline creates them knights and promises other rewards.
	Cornelius enters and announces that the Queen has died in madness. Before she died, she confessed that she never loved Cymbeline, but married him for his royal position; that she killed Imogen with poison; and that she had intended to poison Cymbeline slowly with a mineral, winning him over to the idea of naming Cloten as his heir. But when Cloten vanished, she grew desperate and died. Cymbeline says that his senses were not at fault, since she was beautiful and flattered him well, and neither was his heart, which ""thought her like her seeming"" (line 65), but he repents his folly in choosing her.
	Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer, and other Roman prisoners are brought in. Posthumus and the still-disguised Imogen/Fidele follow. Cymbeline tells Lucius that the relatives of the British soldiers who died in battle have asked him to kill the Roman prisoners. Lucius says that the Britons only won the battle by accident, and that if the Romans had won, they would not have threatened British prisoners with the sword. But if they are to die, they will bear it ""with a Roman's heart"" (line 81). He asks only that his page (Imogen) be ransomed, as he is a Briton who has done no Briton harm. Cymbeline says the boy's face looks familiar, and grants his life and any favor he might ask - even the life of the noblest prisoner. Lucius tells Imogen/Fidele that he need not beg for his (Lucius's) life. Imogen tells him that she did not intend to: Lucius's life ""must shuffle for itself"" as she has seen something ""Bitter to me as death"" (lines 103-4). She is, of course, looking at Posthumus. Lucius is hurt.
	Cymbeline asks Imogen/Fidele again what he would like, as he loves him more and more. Imogen offers to tell him in private. While they talk aside, Belarius and the sons remark on the resemblance between this lad and Fidele. Pisanio, in an aside, is certain that he is Imogen.
	Cymbeline calls Iachimo forward and asks Imogen/Fidele to speak his demand to him; he also orders Iachimo to answer honestly, on pain of torture. Imogen asks as her promised favor that Iachimo tell from whom he got the ring. Iachimo admits that he got it ""by villainy"" (line 142); it had belonged to the noble Posthumus, whom Cymbeline banished. As Iachimo begins to tell that part of his story involving Imogen, he almost faints, saying his heart ""drops blood."" Iachimo describes how Posthumus praised Cymbeline's daughter above all other women for her chastity, how Posthumus agreed on the wager, and how by trickery he gathered his 'evidence' of Imogen's adultery.
	Posthumus is anguished that he fell for Iachimo's lies. He comes forward, identifying himself to Cymbeline as the one who had Imogen killed and ranting about his guilt. Imogen interrupts him, and he, thinking that she scorns his feelings, hits her. She falls to the ground.
	Pisanio is shocked, telling Posthumus that he never killed Imogen until now. As Pisanio tends to Imogen, Imogen casts him off, saying that he gave her poison. Pisanio protests that he believed the potion to be a precious medicine. Cornelius points out that the Queen confessed to him that she gave the potion to Pisanio for Imogen believing it to be poison, whereas it was only a medicine to temporarily shut down the signs of life. Imogen reveals that she took it, and Belarius realizes that Imogen was never really dead. Imogen asks Posthumus why he threw her from him, and embraces him.
	Cymbeline now recognizes his daughter, and she kneels for his blessing. Belarius tells his sons that he does not blame them for loving Imogen, since they are her brothers. Cymbeline tells Imogen that the Queen is dead and Cloten gone. Pisanio explains that he gave Cloten a forged letter, seemingly from Posthumus, which guided him to the mountains near Milford to seek Imogen. He planned to violate Imogen's honor, though Pisanio knows nothing more.
	Guiderius explains that he killed Cloten. Cymbeline is stunned. He hopes Guiderius can tell him this is not so, since is reluctant to punish Guiderius, in view of his good deeds in the battle. Guiderius refuses to deny it, and justifies his action on the grounds of Cloten's unprincely behavior. Cymbeline regretfully says that Guiderius must die, by law.
	Belarius intervenes, saying that the boys have merited more from Cymbeline than ever Cloten did. He warns the boys that he must tell a story that will be dangerous to him, though helpful to them. Belarius reveals that he is the man who was banished as a traitor by Cymbeline. Cymbeline orders Belarius to be taken away, but Belarius regains control of the situation with a cheeky joke, asking the King first to pay him for bringing up his sons. Belarius explains that he is not the boys' father, as they believe; they are Cymbeline's sons. He was wrongfully banished; he had the boys' nurse, Euriphile, steal them for him, and married her in payment. Now, he gives them back to Cymbeline, saying that he received his punishment before he stole them, in the form of his banishment. He offers as proof a mantle in which Arviragus was wrapped, and which was made by their mother. Cymbeline recalls that Guiderius had a mole on his neck, and Belarius shows that the older boy still has it.
	Cymbeline rejoices that he has as if given birth to three (the sons and the returned Belarius). He tells Imogen that she has unluckily lost a kingdom, as she is no longer the heir. But Imogen protests that she has gained two worlds, meaning her brothers. Imogen and her brothers reveal to Cymbeline that they have met before (in Wales) and loved each other at first sight.
	Cymbeline, in wonder, wants to hear the rest of the story, but first intends that they will go to the temple to give thanks. He greets Belarius as his brother and gives the order for the prisoners to be allowed to share the celebrations. Imogen promises Lucius that she will yet do him service.
	Cymbeline's thoughts turn to the poor soldier who fought so well alongside Belarius and the boys, at which Posthumus identifies himself as this soldier. He asks Iachimo to confirm that it was he who, dressed as the poor soldier, disarmed Iachimo. Iachimo kneels before Posthumus and begs him to take his life. He gives Posthumus the ring and bracelet of ""the truest princess"" (line 417). Posthumus spares Iachimo's life, saying that he does not do him a favor in so doing (because Iachimo will have to live with his guilt), and tells him to ""deal with others better"" (line 421).
	Inspired by Posthumus, Cymbeline gives a blanket pardon to all.
	Grateful to Posthumus's help in the battle, the sons welcome him as their brother. Posthumus calls for the Soothsayer to explain the cryptic prophecy he found after his sleep. The prophecy ends with a prediction of peace and prosperity for Britain through the descendants of the royal sons.
	In an afterthought, Cymbeline tells Lucius that though the Britons won the battle, he will resume the tribute to Rome, from which he was dissuaded by the wicked Queen. The Soothsayer claims his prophecy (told to Lucius) about the eagle soaring from south to west, vanishing in the beams of the sun, was accurate, since it meant that Caesar (the eagle) would unite with Cymbeline (the sun).
	Cymbeline declares peace and orders the Roman and British flags to be carried through London together. They all go to the temple of Jupiter to celebrate.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of revelations, each of which resolves one of the plotlines of the play. As such, it is a scene in which truth triumphs over falsehood and appearance is stripped away, leaving reality visible.
	Iachimo chooses to reveal his story, which resolves the main plotline of Posthumus's false accusation of Imogen, very slowly, heightening the tension and confirming his ascendancy as the most dramatically painted character of the play.
	After Iachimo's confession, the revelations come hot on each others' heels, creating an atmosphere of wonder and magic.
	Though the resolutions of the intellect happen through these revelations, the resolutions of the heart come with forgiveness. Everyone who has been wronged forgives his or her wronger. The most touching example is Imogen's unquestioning forgiveness of her husband Posthumus. The fact that Posthumus strikes her even as they are reunited makes him seem unworthy of her forgiveness, but this has the effect of exalting her love to the status of divine grace (the sense that God loves even the unworthy sinner). The least convincing act of forgiveness is, ironically, Posthumus's to Iachimo. Posthumus says that he is only leaving Iachimo alive because that way he will suffer more. Once again, Posthumus compares poorly to his wife.
	Posthumus' words as Imogen embraces him, ""Hang there like fruit, my soul, / Till the tree die,"" are moving, though whether they are moving enough to regain the audience's sympathy after all he has done, is a question worthy of debate. Especially difficult to stomach is his striking Imogen when she tries to declare her true identity. Granted, he does not know it is her at the time, but given that he is supposedly penitent about his past treatment of her, it seems an ill omen that leads us to wonder how deep his reformation runs.
	Cymbeline's comment that he thought the Queen to be ""like her seeming"" reveals his characteristic lack of emotional instinct and inability to distinguish outer appearance from reality-the same quality that led him to banish honest men and put his trust in wicked and stupid people.
	Cymbeline's promise to resume the tribute to Rome after the Britons won a bloody victory fighting for this very cause is an anti-climax which has caused some critics to wonder if Shakespeare was laughing at his characters or at his audience. However, it may be a patriotic attempt to save face for the British in spite of the chronicler Holinshed's citation of Latin sources claiming that Rome was ultimately victorious, and the fact that the Roman occupation of Britain persisted for many decades after Cymbeline's reign. Shakespeare shows a battle in which the Britons prevailed, rather than the entire war, which the Romans won; then he shows Cymbeline choosing to resume the tribute to Rome out of generosity rather than through subjugation. It's one way of making out that the Britons won, when they actually lost.

Summary of Chapter 1: The Workshop
The narrator will magically use the ink of her pen as a mirror to show us the carpentry workshop of Jonathan Burge in the village of Hayslope in Loamshire, England, 1799. Five workmen there are busy, the most striking of them a tall strong man singing a hymn in a baritone voice as he finishes a mantelpiece. This is Adam Bede, the obvious leader of the group. His brother, Seth, is younger and claims he has finished the door he is working on. Sandy Jim teases him that he forgot the panels on the door. Wiry Ben Cranage pipes in saying that after all, Seth is a wool-gathering Methodist. Adam pushes Ben against the wall until he promises to leave his brother alone. In friendly laughter, the men accuse Seth of thinking of the woman Methodist preacher who will preach on the Green tonight. Seth is in love with Dinah Morris and invites the others to hear her. Adam declares his loyalty to the Church but believes everyone should worship as he chooses. When the church clock strikes six, the other men immediately leave off working, but Adam chides them for having no pride in their work, and he continues until he finishes, going home with his dog, Gyp, while Seth goes to the Green to hear Dinah preach. A stranger, passing by on horseback, cannot help but admire Adam Bede as he passes.
Commentary on Chapter 1
The chapter introduces the place and plunges us into a rural community in Loamshire, perhaps a fictitious name for Warwickshire where the author, Mary Ann Evans grew up and knew farm and village folk. Her father managed an estate there, and his early life provided material for the character of Adam Bede. This is country life in old England before the industrial revolution changed everything, and people moved to the cities for jobs. The author investigates the rural people, their habits and thinking, in greater detail than the English novel had done, for it usually dealt with the upper and middle classes. In this, Eliot is indebted to the poet, William Wordsworth, whose poetry is mentioned in the text. A quote from Wordsworth’s “The Excursion” also appears on the title page. The trials of simple country folk were significant to Wordsworth in what they could teach about life, since they were closer to the earth and primal feelings.
Adam Bede’s name indicates a primal man, like Adam in the Garden of Eden before the fall. Bede is the name of the Anglo-Saxon saint and historian of seventh and eighteenth century England and again brings up the suggestion of early English life in its simplicity. Adam is a peasant attached to the earth and is contrasted to the more spoiled gentry, like Arthur Donnithorne. Eliot uses dialect for the lower class characters, who speak for themselves, and then the narrator comments on their ways and their history, like a latter day Bede.
Adam’s protectiveness towards his younger brother Seth, his fondness for his dog, his love of his work, his love of learning, and his integrity all surface in the very first chapter. The other men respect him, even when he is a little stern with them. The discussion of religion is a main theme in the book and begins here with introducing the “dissenters” or groups that disagreed with the established English church, like the Methodists. Methodism began as a reform movement within the Church of England, begun by John and Charles Wesley, in 1729. Soon, it separated and became a religious movement of its own. The Methodists ministered to the poor, especially in the growing populations around industrial mill towns. These poor were more desperate than the poor in farm country. Methodists made converts easily near the mills and gave people hope, support, and unity. Seth is a Methodist, but Adam does not see why people should not stick to the Church. However, he has been influenced by his own pastor, Mr. Irwine, a tolerant man believing one should worship according to conscience. Adam also defends practical knowledge as important to learn as religion, and that is why he goes to night school to better himself.
The theme of the book is found in the hymn Adam keeps singing: “Let all thy converse be sincere,/ Thy conscience as the noonday clear.”  Adam is known for his honest dealings with others, a standard that not everyone can maintain, he finds out. Because he is so strong, both physically and morally, he cannot understand the weakness of others.",Adam Bede

Chapter 26: In this chapter, Dantes, the Count of Monte Cristo, visits Villefort again for the first time in fourteen years as well.  It seems Villefort didn't really die after all; apparently he recovered from his stabbing.  The two men have a philosophical conversation.  Dantes tells Villefort, ""I maintain my pride in the face of men, but I abandon it before God, who drew me out of nothingness to make me what I am.""
	Later the count says that he has sold his soul to the devil in order to be a part of providence.  In this way, the reader beings to understand Dantes' new role as a demigod who rewards the good yet punishes the bad.

Chapter 29: The count visits Villefort's house, speaking to Madame Villefort about his knowledge of chemistry and poison.  He sends some of the poison to her, though the reader doesn't understand why.  On his way out, he mutters something about sowing the secret seed.  It seems he is up to something sinister.
Chapter 30: Albert visits the count, telling him of his uncertainty about marriage with Danglars' daughter.  After listening for a time, the count promises to help his young friend avoid the marriage he doesn't feel comfortable with.

Chapter 31: In this chapter the count receives a stranger into his home.   Bartolomeo Cava'canti is this stranger.  This man was a major in the Austrian service.  A strange father and son ordeal continues throughout the chapter, and the reader is led to believe that the count has a trick up his sleeve.  The supposed father and son really don't know each other, but are glad to accept money from the count in exchange for playing the parts.
Chapter 32: Valentine Villefort (Villefort's daughter) and Maximilien (Morrel's son) meet in a secret place in the Villefort garden.  It seems Valentine is meant to marry Franz but she doesn't love him or want to marry.  Her true love is Maximilien.  The scene ends with Valentine running back to her room through the garden.

	This scene begins in the room of Monsieur Noirtier, who sits in a wheel-chair and communicates with his eyes.  Valentine, his grandaughter, is said to be his only reason to live.  When Villefort tells his father, Noirtier, about Valentine's coming marriage to Franz, Noirtier becomes enraged.  It seems he has had a grudge against Franz's family for some time. 
	 
	Quickly Noirtier calls for a rotary to re-write his will, giving his money to the poor instead of Valentine.

	Chapter 35:
This chapter is very exciting; it takes place in the home of Monte Cristo during his party.  When Madame Danglars and Villefort are shown through the gate, Bertuccio recognizes them as the pregnant woman and the man from his story.  Bertuccio is shocked that Villefort is alive, yet he's sure that he is the person he stabbed.  Strangely, Bertuccio also recognizes Andrea, the ""son"" of the retired major.  It seems Adrea's real name is Benedetto.  
	Throughout the evening, the count tortures Madame Danglars and Villefort, knowing about their secret affair and the baby they tried to bury to death.  First, the count takes them to the bedroom, pretending to make conjectures about the ""sinister"" deeds which must have happened there so many years ago.  Later, he takes them to the garden where Villefort thought he buried their son.  The count tells them that during a construction project, a baby skeleton was dug up.  This is too much for Madame Danglars-- she turns pale and faints.

Chapter 39:
Madame Danglars visits Villefort in his office.  Villefort admits that he really didn't bury the child; for when he checked the garden again the child had been taken (by Bertuccio).  Yet the scene ends with Villefort promising to find out who Monte Cristo is and what he wants with their dirty little secret.

326,My Antonia: Novel Summary,"Introduction
My Ántonia opens with a short frame story: the author (presumably Willa Cather) relates a chance meeting with an old acquaintance, Jim Burden, on a train ride through Iowa.  The time appears to be roughly contemporary with the publication of the novel (1918).  The two adults reminisce about their shared Nebraska childhood, where they first met, and they mention a woman named Ántonia.  They challenge each other to write an account of their relationship with Ántonia, and only Jim appears to follow through, composing a lengthy manuscript and bringing it to her a few months later.  The author says that this manuscript became the text of My Ántonia. 
Analysis
	Cather chooses this character of Jim Burden as the narrator for two obvious reasons. It allows her to manipulate or mediate the perspective that she uses to write about Ántonia (as a romantic interest, as an exceptionally strange woman, among many other perspectives), and it displaces some of the credit/blame for the story to someone else without moving too far away from her (someone from her hometown in Nebraska, who understands life in a small prairie town).
	 
	A frame story is a narrative within which a character proceeds to tell a story.  
Book I: The Shimerdas
Parts I – IV
Part I
	The book opens with Jim Burden, the narrator, being taken west from Virginia to Nebraska to live with his grandparents after his parents’ deaths.  Jake Marpole, a farm hand who worked for Jim’s parents, accompanies him.  Jake is a young man at the time, and Jim is ten years old.  They take a train across the country, and they hear about an immigrant family traveling on the same train going to the same place, Black Hawk, Nebraska.  Jake buys and gives Jim a copy of The Life of Jesse James, a book he treasures for many years. 
	When they arrive at Black Hawk, Jake and Jim see the immigrant family (the Shimerdas), and hear the family talking in a foreign language.  They are greeted by Otto Fuchs, a German immigrant and employee of Jim’s grandparents.  Jim compares Fuchs to a character from the Jesse James book—he is visibly tanned and scarred, and dressed like a cowboy—and Fuchs leads them to a wagon to take them to the Burdens’ farm.  Jim notices the immigrant family again, getting into the only other wagon present. Fuchs drives them over the Nebraska land, and Jim thinks to himself about how empty and featureless the land is compared to Virginia.  He realizes he has left his parents behind, and he feels intimidated and insignificant under the vast sky and wide, flat land.
	Part II
	Jim falls asleep in the wagon and wakes up in his grandparents’ house.  He sees his grandmother when he opens his eyes, and she immediately compares him to her dead son—Jim’s father—and invites him into the kitchen.  Jim makes his way out of bed and down to the basement kitchen, and he seems impressed by the order and cleanliness of the arrangement.  He takes a bath in the tin washtub in the kitchen while his grandmother is in the attached dining room, refusing her help with cleaning himself.  Jim notices the details of the kitchen, acquaints himself with the pets of the house, and muses for a little while on his impressions of his grandparents.  Otto Fuchs introduces him to one of the horses, and Jim, Otto, and Jake are called upstairs for prayers.  The next day, Jim goes outside and starts to get to know the town.  His grandparents apparently live in the only wooden house in the entire town; the neighbors live in sod houses.  Most of the area around the house, at least the part not covered with corn, is covered with wild red grass. 
	As Jim is musing on the red grass, his grandmother invites him to accompany her to the garden to dig up some potatoes.  She tells him that he should never go to the garden without some kind of weapon to protect him from rattlesnakes.  After digging some potatoes, Jim asks if he can stay in the garden without his grandmother.  She agrees, but she gives him some information about all of the various animals that he might see.  He spends a good portion of the day in the garden, and he enjoys the feeling that he has become part of the land. 
	Part III
	A few days later, Jim accompanies Otto Fuchs on a trip to visit the new Bohemian family in the town with a gift of some provisions.  Jim finds out that the Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, bought a piece of land not far from his grandparents, and that they had paid too much for it.  They had been swindled by Peter Krajiek, a Bohemian man who was already living there.  No one in the family spoke enough English to survive without Krajiek, so he also functioned as their interpreter.  Fuchs suggests that he might have helped them with Krajiek, except that he doesn’t think the Shimerdas will trust an Austrian.  When asked to explain, Fuchs says that it’s “politics,” and that it would take too long, but that Bohemians don’t trust Austrians. 
	As the Grandmother, Fuchs, and Jim make their way to the Shimerdas’ farm, they notice Squaw Creek, a narrow stream that runs through a deep ravine through the Shimerdas’ land.  The ravine makes farming that piece of land difficult and reduces its value.  They come upon the Shimerdas’ house, a dugout built against the edge of the ravine.  Mrs. Shimerda comes out of the house to meet them, and shakes Grandmother’s hand.  She speaks a little English about the house, saying that it is no good.  Ántonia and Yulka, the two daughters, come out of the house and meet the visitors, as does Ambrosch, the oldest son.  Ántonia, Jim notices, is brown-skinned and brown-eyed, and quite beautiful.  She is about fourteen years old, a few years older than Jim.  While the two families are talking, Krajiek and Marek, the second son who shows off a webbed finger and acts a bit strangely, approach from the barn.  At some point, Mr. Shimerda emerges, and Jim is greatly impressed by his appearance and his demeanor.  Mr. Shimerda doesn’t seem to belong on a farm; he seems too aristocratic for farm labor. 
	Ántonia and Yulka drag Jim away from his family and bring him over to the edge of the ravine.  Ántonia starts quizzing him on the English names for things, including his own.  Jim teaches her several English words, and she tries to repay him with a gift of a ring.  After a little while, Mr. Shimerda comes looking for the girls, and they run to meet him.  Mr. Shimerda confronts Jim with a silent, questioning look.  Then he returns to the house, takes out a book with Bohemian and English alphabets, and asks Grandmother to teach Ántonia English. 
	Part IV
	Jim learns to ride one of his grandparents’ horses, and he becomes the messenger for the family.  As the messenger, with the freedom of travel that he has with the horse, he becomes a sightseer, traveling about the area to admire the landscapes.  He also instructs Ántonia in English every day.  She runs across the prairie between them, and Jim shares some of the watermelon from the farm with her.  Jim also notices the ways that the rattlesnakes take advantage of the prairie dogs in the area, and compares Krajiek to a rattlesnake in a prairie dog town.  The Shimerdas don’t know how to get rid of their only English-speaking Bohemian companion. 
Analysis, Parts I-IV
	Cather sets the Shimerda family up in a way that seems to promise catastrophe.  In her description of Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch, she suggests that they are self-interested and cunning.  Mr. Shimerda appears to be set up to be a victim of tragedy, as a kind of great man set up to suffer through inappropriate or unsuitable challenges.  He is a musician but there is no one who will listen to him.  The family also appears to be facing a difficult struggle, with a poor house and a poor plot of land to farm, and only a cheating Krajiek to help them succeed as farmers.  Jim’s family appears as welcome charity to the Shimerdas, but Jim’s family has no solution for the bulk of the Shimerdas’ problems.

327,Cyrano de Bergerac: Summary,"Act 1, scene 1
	The play opens in the year 1640 in the theater at the Hotel de Bourgogne in Paris, France. Preparations are under way for a performance of the play La Clorise. Members of the audience from all social classes, pickpockets, and an orange-girl arrive. Two gentlemen practice fencing. A middle-class man (the Bourgeois) looks disapprovingly at the drinking, fighting, and gambling taking place among the audience and reflects that the place has sunk into disrepute since the great tragedies were performed there. As the chandeliers are lit in readiness for the performance, the audience gathers around in anticipation. The handsome young Baron Christian de Neuvillette enters with the satirist Lignière, who is drunk.
Act 1, scene 2
	Lignière introduces Christian to some Marquises. Christian has just arrived in Paris to join the Guards. The Marquises think that Christian is not very fashionably dressed; they are more interested in the aristocratic and literary ladies who are taking their places in the boxes. Lignière has come to help Christian identify a lady with whom he (Christian) is in love. The pastry-cook Ragueneau arrives. Lignière introduces him to Christian, explaining that Ragueneau is a lover of poetry who accepts poems as payment for his pastries. Ragueneau is excited to know if Cyrano, another member of the Guards, is here. The actor Montfleury is performing tonight and Cyrano has forbidden him to appear on the stage for the rest of the month. Cyrano’s friends talk of him as a brilliant poet, swordsman, philosopher, and musician. They seem in awe of him. Ragueneau mentions that Cyrano has an enormous nose, and Le Bret warns that Cyrano will fight anyone who comments on it.
	Roxane, a beautiful young woman and the object of Christian’s affections, arrives and sits in a box. Lignière tells Christian that she is Cyrano’s cousin. He adds that she is an intellectual. Christian is despondent at this news. Roxane is accompanied by the Comte de Guiche, a nobleman who is in love with her. He is already married, so he plans to marry her off to one of his protégés, the Vicomte de Valvert, who would turn a blind eye to any affair that de Guiche began with Roxane. Roxane and Christian exchange gazes. Lignière leaves to find a tavern. There is still no sign of Cyrano. The crowd impatiently calls for the play to begin.
Act 1, scene 3
	As de Guiche and Valvert walk towards the stage, Christian decides to challenge Valvert to a duel over Roxane. As he reaches into his pocket for his glove to slap Valvert across the face by way of challenge, he encounters the hand of a pickpocket. In exchange for his release, the pickpocket tells Christian that Lignière is in trouble. Lignière has offended an important nobleman by writing a satirical song about him, and the nobleman has arranged for Lignière to be ambushed by a hundred men at the Porte de Nesle on his way home. Christian runs off to rescue Lignière.
	De Guiche, Valvert, and the Marquises take their seats on the stage. The crowd chants for the play to begin. Montfleury, a fat and untalented actor, comes on stage dressed as a shepherd and begins his speech. A voice from the pit is heard crying out, “Fool, have I not forbidden you the stage?” Though the speaker is hidden, Le Bret and Cuigy are certain that it is Cyrano. Each time Montfleury tries to continue his speech, the speaker interrupts and threatens him. Montfleury’s voice grows fainter and fainter. Finally, Cyrano stands up on his chair, creating a stir among the audience.
Analysis of Act 1, scenes 1–3
	These scenes introduce the social and cultural background, the characters, and the first seeds of the plot. The theater is presented as a microcosm (miniature version) of Parisian society, bringing together people from all social backgrounds and walks of life. Poetry and literature are unifying influences: the marquises idolize the literary ladies, while the pastry-cook Ragueneau sells his wares in exchange for poems. In fact, poetry is so important in this culture that it is a matter of life and death: Lignière’s life is threatened because he wrote a satirical song about a nobleman.
	One of Rostand’s themes in Cyrano de Bergerac is what he saw as the decline of French society and culture. This is already evident in the Bourgeois’s disapproving comments on the low-life activities taking place among the theater audience, compared with the great tragedies that used to be performed there, such as those of the seventeenth-century French playwrights Jean Rotrou and Pierre Corneille. The nobility have become decadent and foolish, as is shown in the petty snobberies of the Marquises, who disdain Christian because he is not dressed in the latest fashion, and fawn upon de Guiche because he is successful.
	Against such foolish and inconsequential characters is set the play’s hero, Cyrano. Though Cyrano is spoken of at length, he is not seen until the end of scene 3. He is described by his friends as an excellent poet, swordsman, philosopher, and musician: in short, the epitome of the seventeenth-century cavalier ideal of the courtier-soldier-poet.
	Cyrano’s reputation precedes him. A section of the audience waits with bated breath to see whether he will appear at the play, as Montfleury is playing the lead and Cyrano has forbidden him the stage. If Montfleury appears, the audience knows there will be trouble. He is spoken of as an extraordinary, larger-than-life character, and thus suspense builds around him. In fact, there are three layers of suspense in this part of the play: the play audience’s expectation of the actor Montfleury appearing in the play, La Clorise; Cyrano’s friends’ expectation of Cyrano, whose arrival promises far more momentous entertainment than Montfleury; and finally, the expectation of the reader (or audience) of the play Cyrano de Bergerac as they await the appearance of this extraordinary character Cyrano.
	As well as his exceptional abilities, Cyrano’s great flaw, his enormous nose, is mentioned. Ragueneau’s comment that Cyrano will fight anyone who remarks on it both conveys Cyrano’s sensitivity over this trait and foreshadows the conflicts that are sure to spring up around the subject. The fact that Cyrano’s friends only mention his nose after they have listed his other great qualities puts his flaw into perspective. To them, it seems relatively unimportant, or just another way in which Cyrano is extraordinary, but Cyrano does not share their view. His insecurity over his nose rules his life.
	Christian is a foil to Cyrano and his opposite. While Cyrano is extraordinary on the inside but physically unattractive on the outside, Christian is a very ordinary young man blessed with unusual good looks. Christian’s love for Roxane sets up the main conflict that drives the plot. The glance they exchange in the theater establishes the immediate physical attraction between them, but Christian’s concern over Lignière’s description of her as an intellectual shows his weak point. Unlike the brilliant Cyrano, Christian is dull of mind. While Cyrano represents inward beauty, Christian represents outward beauty.

	Book One - An Upright Man
	The story begins in 1815 with a description of Charles Francois-Bievenu Myriel who was at that time the Bishop of Digne. He was about seventy-five years old and had been Bishop since 1806. He was the son of a rich family and as a young man had married and lived a worldly life devoted to pleasure. During the French Revolution he fled to Italy where his wife died. When he returned to France he was a priest. While serving as a cure he went to Paris on a business trip at roughly the same time as Napoleon's coronation. He happened to meet the Emperor and paid him a compliment. Soon afterward he learned that he had been appointed Bishop of Digne, a rough and mountainous region that suited his preference for seclusion. He lived with his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine and a domestic servant Madame Magloire. Soon after arriving in Digne he traded residences with the hospital next door so that the spacious buildings and grounds of the Bishop's palace could be used for patients and he could live in the small building formerly used for the hospital. He drew up a household budget in order to allocate the fifteen thousand livres he received as a salary every year and much to Madame Magloire's chagrin the bulk of his income was used for charitable purposes and left little for housekeeping. The bishop traveled simply by foot or mule, admonished people to help the poor, and formed a strong opinion against the death penalty after counseling a prisoner and witnessing the man's death at the guillotine. Everything about the bishop's life was indicative of simplicity and economy except for a set of silver cutlery and two silver candlesticks because, as he once said, it would be difficult for him to give up eating from silver. All these valuables were much cherished by Madame Magloire and were kept in an unlocked cabinet at the head of the bishop's bed. The bishop would not permit the doors of the house to be locked. He loved flowers and spent many happy hours in his garden caring for his small plot.
	The bishop put all his faith in God. On one occasion he risked an attack from bandits to visit some neglected parishioners in a remote hamlet. Before leaving the hamlet he resolved to say a formal Te Deum service but the poor village lacked the proper religious articles. The next day the bishop found a chest with fine gold articles for the service left by the bandits. On another occasion he was debating with a worldly senator from his district and wholeheartedly agreed with the senator that materialism was the proper philosophy of the rich because it left the poor with religion. Once he went to see a dying man who had lived as an outcast from society because he had been a member of the National Convention and was tied to acts of regicide and atheism. After a lengthy interview the bishop was so humbled by the conventionist's story that he begged for the dying man's benediction. The bishop was loved by his parishioners but not well liked by his peers because his life of scarcity and charity annoyed them.
	Analysis
	The novel begins with a description of one of the main characters, Myriel, who has changed from being a rich and worldly individual to a devout religious leader. He is introduced as being a very pious and self sacrificing person who has embraced religion in its purest form. He is sincere when he gives up his spacious living quarters and donates it to the hospital which occupies a very small building so that the patients would be able to enjoy a more comfortable setting.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book 2 - The Fall
	One evening in early October of 1815 a bedraggled man who looked to be in his late forties entered Digne on foot. He was hairy and dirty and carried a large knobbed walking stick and a stuffed backpack. After stopping at the mayor's office the man went to an inn where he ordered lodging and food and sat down to wait by the fire. The suspicious innkeeper scribbled a note and gave it to an errand boy. The traveler, who was noticeably hungry, asked several times when dinner would be ready and was angry to learn that the innkeeper would not lodge him nor give him a meal. The innkeeper showed him the note from the mayor that proved that the traveler was a recently freed convict named Jean Valjean who was not welcome at the inn. Jean Valjean took up his knapsack and left. He walked to a tavern but was refused service there as well. He asked for lodging at the prison but was refused. Finally, he knocked at a family's door to purchase a meal but was chased off at gunpoint. Night came and the air became very cold. Jean Valjean worked his way into a small hut in the back of a garden but soon realized that the rude shelter was meant for a bulldog that chased him off the property. He returned to the town's square and lay down upon a stone bench. An old woman, assuming him to be a poor soldier, gave him a little money and advised him to knock on the bishop's door and ask for charity.
	Inside the bishop's house, Madame Magloire has just finished reporting that a rough looking vagabond has been seen in the town when Jean Valjean knocks and the bishop calls out for the visitor to enter. To Madame Magloire's horror Jean Valjean steps into the house and explains who he is and what has happened to him since he arrived in the town. He shows the bishop his yellow passport, which marked him as a convict, and explains that he can read and proves it by reading his passport. The passport reveals that he served nineteen years in the galleys, five for burglary and an additional fourteen years for multiple attempts to escape. The bishop informs Jean Valjean that he will be fed and given a bed for the night. Jean Valjean assumes that the man addressing him is simply the cure of the church. While Jean Valjean warms himself by the fire the bishop explains that he is welcome in the house because it is the house of Christ and the traveler has more right to its contents than the priest. He indicates for Madame Magloire to bring out the silver candlesticks and light the candles. While they eat, the bishop tells Madam Magloire to set out the additional silver plates, a display of finery normally reserved for important visitors. Jean Valjean is impressed by the cleric's courtesy.
	The narrative briefly switches to an excerpt from a letter written by Mademoiselle Baptistine that describes the conversation that evening. She relates that the convict ate voraciously as though he were starved. Afterward the bishop inquired where Valjean was heading and upon learning that it was to Pontarlier launched into a detailed description of the industry there in particular the cheese making industry. By his description he wanted the convict to know that he would find sanctuary and employment there. Mademoiselle Baptistine notes that at no point during the conversation did the bishop use language to remind the convict of his condition.
	The ladies retire upstairs for the night and the bishop shows Jean Valjean to his bed in an alcove of the oratory. As they pass through the bishop's bedroom, Jean Valjean sees Madame Magloire putting the silver away in the cupboard. The convict asks his host why he is willing to lodge a dangerous criminal so close to his own bedroom. The bishop responds that God will take care of all that and blesses Jean Valjean before he leaves. Jean Valjean falls into a deep sleep.
	The narrator describes the personal history of Jean Valjean. He was born to a peasant family in Brie and when he grew up he became a pruner at Faverolles. His parents died when he was young and he was raised by his only surviving relative an older sister and her husband. When his sister's husband died she had seven children under the age of eight to raise and Jean, who was twenty-five at the time, took on the burden of supporting her family. Even with Jean's selfless hard work the children were hungry. Finally, one cold winter the family had no money and no bread and Jean could not find work. He tried to steal a loaf of bread, was caught and sentenced to five years of hard labor in the galleys. His attempts to escape the work gangs elongated his sentence and he became a hardened, sullen man. Prison made him physically strong and supple. He learned to read and he condemned society for his excessive punishment and resolved always to hate it. Thanks to prison he was equally capable of spontaneous acts of crime borne of his resolve against society and also premeditated crimes free of conscience. Since leaving prison Jean had been paid for his work in the galleys but the prison had retained some of that pay as ""rent"". After leaving prison he had spent a day working to unload a wagon but had been paid only half wages because he was a prisoner. In both instances he felt himself robbed and his sensibility was further hardened.
	Jean Valjean came awake at two a.m. and was unable to fall asleep. His mind would not let go of the image of the silver being placed in the cupboard and he calculated that it was worth twice what he had earned in nineteen years of hard labor. At 3:15 a.m. he crept into the bishop's bedroom. He paused to look at the serene visage of the sleeping priest and then quickly took the silver from the cupboard, stuffed it in his sack, jumped out the window near the alcove, scaled the garden wall and was gone. The next morning the bishop was in his flower garden when the theft was discovered. Much to Madame Magloire's chagrin he took the news calmly and reasoned that he had no right to the silver and that it was best that the poor man should have it and that in the future he would use wooden implements. While they were breakfasting several guards arrived with Jean Valjean restrained by a collar. When the guards address the priest as Monseigneur Jean, Valjean learns for the first time that his host is a bishop. The bishop immediately accosts Jean Valjean for not taking the candlesticks that he offered as well. The guards are amazed to learn that the bishop claims to have given the silver, including the candlesticks, to Valjean the previous evening. The guards leave and the bishop approaches Valjean, who seems about to faint, and says in a low voice:
	""Don't forget, ever, that you have promised me to use this silver to become an honest man . . . Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul I am buying for you. I withdraw it from dark thoughts and from the spirit of perdition and I give it to God!""
	Jean Valjean was bewildered and his thoughts were in an uproar. He fled into the countryside as though pursued and finally came to sit and ponder. A small boy who worked as a Savoyard came down the lane playing a game with his coins by throwing them in the air and catching them with the back of his hand. A large forty-sous piece eluded him, however, and came to rest near Jean Valjean who unconsciously put his foot over it. The boy approached Valjean and asked for his coin but Valjean only asked the boy's name and learned that it was Petit Gervais. He told the boy to get away and after chasing him with a stick saw the coin and realized what he had done. He called for the boy but to no avail. He stopped a passing priest and gave the man money for his poor but could learn nothing of the small boy. He asked to be arrested and the priest fled in fear. Jean Valjean sank to the ground and burst into tears. It was the first time he had cried in nineteen years. His soul came awake within him and he perceived the goodness that had been given to him by the bishop. That night a stage driver noticed a man knelt in prayer in front of the bishop's house and soon afterward Jean Valjean disappeared from the region.
	Analysis
	In book two, the reader is introduced to Valjean, who is prevented by society to overcome his past. The fact that he is an ex-prisoners haunts him wherever he goes and he is rejected everywhere. When he tries to buy a meal for himself, the innkeeper throws him out and treats him like a criminal. No one seems to be interested that he had been imprisoned for a very minor offense in the first place and was now trying to be an honest individual.
	In contrast to Myriel and his ability to change his personality, in this character we see how futile it is for Valjean to even try to change and be an honest man as nobody wants to give him a second chance. It is almost inevitable that he will steal the silver from the priest.
	Hugo uses Valjean to show the injustice of France's penal system as he had been imprisoned for nineteen years for simply stealing some bread for his hungry family. Additionally, instead of coming out of prison as a rehabilitated person, he came out as an angry and bitter man feeling that he had been cheated and treated unfairly.
	It is Myriel's act of kindness that first arouses within him a feeling that what he had done with the coin that belonged to the boy, was wrong.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book 3 - In the Year 1817
	This section begins with the description of four young students from wealthy families in the country who have engaged in a love affair with four young Parisian working girls. The oldest of the students is named Tholomy's and, though he has lost most of his hair and all his teeth, he is the acknowledged leader of the group because of his incisive wit. He is paired with the youngest girl; a pretty country girl named Fantine with lustrous blonde hair and perfect teeth. Fantine has fallen deeply in love with Tholomy's but he considers their relationship nothing more than a casual amour. One day Tholomy's proposes to his student friends that they satisfy the girls' demand for a surprise as well as their parents' wish for them to return home with one devilish plan. The following Sunday the group goes out for a day of frolicking and picnicking all over Paris during the course of which they enjoy a game of ring toss, view a rare shrub from India and ride donkeys. All the while, however, the girls beg for their surprise but Tholomy's admonishes them to be patient. Finally the group ends up at a restaurant table near two large windows that look out on the Champs-Elysees. After some drinking and general merriment Tholomy's agrees that it is time to give the girls their surprise and each man places a kiss upon his sweethearts head before leaving to fetch the surprise. The girls watch them cross over the street arm-in-arm. The girls wait impatiently for an hour. A waiter arrives with a note from the men that he was instructed to wait an hour before delivering. In very ironic and clever terms the note informs the girls that their men have returned to their parents to become respectable members of society. For the three older women it is a comical and somewhat expected conclusion but Fantine cries herself to sleep that night because she knows she is carrying Tholomy's' child.
	Analysis
	Book three depicts the differences between the students who come from a wealthy background and the girls whose families are from the working class. The students are bright and frivolous whereas the girls are more illiterate and vulnerable. When the men pull their ""surprise"" and leave the girls, Fantine, the youngest and most beautiful one is hurt the most as she is left bearing a child.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book Four - To Trust is Sometimes to Surrender
	Time passes. Fantine, who is illiterate, has a functionary write three letters to Tholomy's but receives no reply. She has a daughter whom she names Euphraise but calls Cosette and over time she sells all her fine things to provide fine clothes for her daughter. Though she has no relatives, she decides to leave Paris to seek work in Montreuil-sur-mer where she was raised. In Montfermeil just outside of Paris she comes across an old inn decorated with a sign depicting a soldier carrying a wounded general off a field of battle. She notices the proprietress sitting outside with her two small daughters and the two women converse while the children play. The woman introduces herself as Madame Thenardier and explains that she and her husband own the inn. Fantine explains that her husband is dead and she is returning home to seek work. Noticing how happily the children are playing together Fantine suddenly asks if Madame Thenardier will take her daughter while she goes to find work since the factories will not hire her if she has a child. She offers to pay at which point Monsieur Thenardier enters the discussion and demands seven francs a month, six months paid in advance plus an extra fifteen francs for the first expenses. Though it nearly exhausts all her money Fantine agrees and the next morning she tearfully bids farewell to Cosette. After she leaves the Thenardiers show their true nature as they discuss the manner in which Fantine's money will be used to pay off their debt. The next month they pawn Cosette's fine clothing and dress her in rags, feed her as though she were a dog and make her work from sunup to well past sundown. Meanwhile, Fantine finds work and has letters sent often to which the Thenardier's respond that her daughter is doing very well. After a year, Thenardier ups the fee to twelve francs a months and Fantine sends it. The following year the fee increases to fifteen francs a month and Fantine sends that as well. After some time, however, she became remiss in her payments. All this time Cosette is bullied by the other girls and becomes thin and miserable. The Thenardiers nickname her the Lark.
	Analysis
	In Book Three, Hugo has shown that the wealthy class has no compassion for the working class and tends to use them to satisfy their own needs. In Book Four, he shows that even within the same class, compassion does not exist. Even though the Thenardiers could relate to Fantine, they take advantage of her by taking her money and mistreating Cosette.

333,Les Miserables: Novel Summary: Section 1 - Book 5,"
	 
Section 1 - Fantine
	Book Five - The Descent
	This section begins by detailing what happened to Fantine after she left the Thenardiers. She arrived in Montreuil-sur-mer to find the region prosperous due to a recent innovation in the primary industry of imitating English jets and German black glass trinkets. On a December night in 1815 a rough looking man of about fifty years age had entered the town just in time to save, at great personal risk, the children of the captain of police from a house fire. No one had thought to ask for his passport and he became known as Father Madeleine. Soon afterward he developed the techniques which made possible the revolution in the black work industry. The success made him rich and all those in the region substantially better off. After amassing a great fortune in the first year he built a large factory where everyone who wanted work could find it. This is where Fantine sought and found gainful employment. Father Madeleine was asked to be mayor of the town but declined. His innovations won him the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor at the Industrial Exhibition but he declined this as well. As his fortune increased he was courted by the high society of the region but he refused to join that elevated set. By 1820 his innovations had brought such prosperity to the region that the king appointed him Mayor and when he tried to refuse the citizens begged and he finally assented. He remained a simple man; however, who enjoyed solitude and reading. He always kept money in his pocket to give to the poor. It was rumored that he had millions of francs deposited at Laffitte's financial house when in fact his philanthropy had reduced that sum to about six hundred thousand francs. One day, news reached the town that the Bishop of Digne has died and Father Madeleine dressed in mourning. Anytime a Savoyard came through the town Father Madeleine would ask his name and give him money. In time, Father Madeleine achieved almost holy status among the people of the region and he was asked to judge many disputes. A member of the local police named Javert, whose mannerisms and appearance were reminiscent of a wolf, persisted in distrusting Father Madeleine. Javert was the son of a prostitute and had been born in prison. He had absolute and unquestioning respect for authority and followed the letter of the law but he had no compassion for convicts. Javert was convinced that he knew Father Madeleine as someone else but each time he thought he had established a lead into the man's past it would evaporate.
	One day an old man named Fauchelevent, who always resented Madeleine's success, was trapped in the mud beneath his horse cart and a crowd soon gathered. The cart was too heavy to lift and so Javert sent for a jack. The cart, however, was sinking fast and Father Madeleine ascertained that the jack would not arrive in time to save the poor man. Madeleine offered money to anyone who had the courage to climb under the cart and lift it off. Javert looked Madeleine in the eye and stated that the only man he ever saw with that kind of strength was a convict in the galleys at Toulon. When no other man offered to help, Madeleine dove under the cart and with great exertion lifted it off the old man. Fauchelevent's knee was broken and while he recovered in Madeleine's hospital he received a thousand-franc note with a message that Father Madeleine had purchased his horse (which was dead) and his cart (which was broken). Madeleine secured a position as gardener in a convent in the Quarter Saint Antoine in Paris for the grateful old man.
	Fantine returned to the town soon after Father Madeleine became mayor. She found work at the factory and dreamed of reuniting with her daughter. Some of the women discovered she had a daughter and the gossip led the overseer to fire her in the name of the mayor, though in fact Father Madeleine had no knowledge of Fantine or her plight. She struggled to find work and gradually succumbed to the debts she owed for rent and furnishings. The Thenardiers sent word that Cosette needed a wool skirt for the winter so Fantine sold her hair and sent a skirt. The Thenardiers gave the skirt to their eldest daughter. Ever desperate for money the Thenardiers wrote that Cosette was very ill and they needed forty francs for the necessary medicine. Fantine sold her front teeth and sent the money. Eventually she was forced into prostitution to support the demands of the Thenardiers. One cold January evening Fantine was walking a street circuit that took her by the Officer's club where a dandy gentleman hurled insults at her each time she passed. Achieving no results with words the young man devilishly grabbed a handful of snow and shoved it down Fantine's bedraggled gown. Fantine attacked the man and loudly cursed him. Javert arrives and leads her, trembling with fear, to the police station where he tells her that she will serve six months in prison for her offense. Fantine becomes hysterical and pleads for mercy in the name of her daughter but Javert coldly tells her that nothing can save her from a prison term. At this juncture Father Madeleine, who entered unnoticed, approaches and Javert respectfully addresses him as ""Monsieur Mayor"". The name is like a trigger for Fantine, who associates the mayor with her loss of position. She approaches him and spits in his face. Without skipping a beat, however, Madeleine commands Javert to release the poor woman. This command amazes both Javert and Fantine who does not believe that it came from the mayor. She begins to speak distractedly and in the process divulges her sad history. When she tries to leave, however, Javert commands the sergeant to stop her but Madeleine once again insists that she be set free. Javert resists this command but the mayor finally trumps his authority and promises Fantine that she will be reunited with her daughter and will be comfortable and happy. She faints.
	Analysis
	Hugo is full of praise for what the Industrial Revolution has done for the average man by allowing ordinary working men to become wealthy. This depicts the rise of the Middle Class which does not require a certain past or background.
	In Book Five, Hugo again shows how the working class is void of empathy or consideration for their own. It is a co-worker that reveals that Fantine has a child and is the cause of her dismissal. Fantine's inability to find a different job and her need to cover her expenses that the Thenardiers impose upon her, she resorts to prostitution.
	She is finally rescued from going to prison by Madeleine who she first thought had been responsible for her initial dismissal from her job.
	The technique of foreshadowing is used by Hugo when Javits, a member of the local police, hints that there is only one man, an ex-prisoner, who possesses such gigantic strength. We surmise that it could be Valjean especially when we see that Madelein wears a black armband, a sign of mourning, after hearing that Myriel had died.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book Six - Javert
	Madeleine has Fantine installed at the infirmary where her gentle nature soon wins over the nuns. Madeleine makes inquiries and learns all of Fantine's sorry history and he resolves to reunite her with her child. He sends money and a command to bring the girl but the Thenardiers, sensing they might be able to soak more money from Fantine's benefactor, offer only pitiful excuses and demands for more money. With Fantine's health deteriorating Madeleine resolves to retrieve Cosette himself if necessary and has a letter drawn up in which Fantine orders Monsieur Thenardier to deliver Cosette to the bearer of the letter. Before Madeleine can retrieve Cosette, however, Javert comes to see him and confesses that he has written Paris to denounce Madeleine as the convict Jean Valjean. His superiors in Paris, however, have informed him that another man, known as Father Champmathieu, has been arrested for stealing apples and was positively identified by three other convicts as being Jean Valjean. Javert has since seen the man himself and also believes that he is Jean Valjean. He tells Madeleine that he will travel to Arras the following day to testify at the trial which will certainly sentence the man to hard labor for life. Monsieur Madeleine pretends not to be affected by the news. Javert insists that because he denounced a superior he is no longer fit to serve as a police officer but Madeleine insists that he continue his duties.
	Analysis
	Javert's actions are not calculated to destroy Madeleine. They are simply motivated by his admiration for the law and the judicial system. When he offers to resign his position, he honestly believes that he has failed the system because he thinks that Madeleine is an ex-criminal.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book Seven - The Champmathieu Affair
	That afternoon the Mayor goes to visit Fantine as usual but stays twice as long. The doctor whispers to him that Fantine is sinking fast and the mayor takes Sister Simplice, who has never told a lie, to give Fantine everything she needs to be comfortable. He then goes to a man who keeps horses and arranges for a horse and small tilbury chaise to be waiting for him at half past four the next morning. That evening the janitor of the factory, who also serves as the mayor's only servant, notices that the mayor has extinguished the light in his room earlier than usual and later that evening he hears the sound of pacing and furniture being moved in the mayor's room.
	Of course Father Madeleine is really Jean Valjean and the narrator relates that ever since he mistakenly robbed the Savoyard Petit Jarvis he had endeavored to put his virtue before his security. He had struggled to conceal his name and return to God and had so far succeeded but the news of Champmathieu's arrest had stirred his soul and put him in a quandary. He had left orders regarding Fantine and hired the horse and carriage in order to be prepared to travel to Arras and vindicate the innocent man. He recoiled at the thought of returning to prison, however, and spent the whole night trying to convince himself that he did not need to go to Arras. He was most resolute in his decision not to denounce himself when he thought of Cosette and Fantine and reasoned that if he returned to prison no one would reunite them. He opened a compartment in his chimney and removed the two candlesticks the bishop gave him many years before. He thought he might destroy them and completely sever himself from the name Jean Valjean but his conscience reminds him that an innocent man will suffer and his interior deliberations renew. Finally he sleeps and is awakened by his servant who tells him that the horse and chaise have arrived.
	Jean Valjean spends the day struggling to get to Arras. On the way out of town his chaise glances the side of a mail coach and later a stable boy tells him that his wheel is damaged and will not go any further. Jean Valjean inquires about every possibility to continue his journey but when he realizes that he will not make it to Arras he is relieved and believes Providence has made the decision for him. At this moment, however, an old woman approaches and offers to sell him an old chaise and he is morally bound to continue his journey. Later, his horse becomes exhausted and he finds that the road is under repair but a peasant tells him where he can hire a second horse and a boy to guide him. When the whiffletree on the harness breaks the boy declares that they will not make it to Arras that night but Jean Valjean fashions one from some string and a branch and they continue. At seven o'clock they are still an hour away and Jean Valjean believes that they are probably too late.
	Meanwhile, back in Montreuil-sur-mer, Fantine's illness caused her to become delirious. She waited in vain for the mayor to pay his regular afternoon visit and when he did not come she became morose. The nuns sent for him but soon discovered that he had left town and that he would return the following day. Fantine, overhearing them whisper, asked Sister Simplice (who never lied) what happened to the Mayor and the nun replied that he had gone away. Fantine, believing that he has gone to fetch Cosette, becomes overjoyed and when the doctor looks in on her that evening he confesses that though her disease is terminal and well advanced she looks like she might recover.
	Jean Valjean arrives in Arras just before eight o'clock. He is shown the way to the courthouse and is disappointed to find that the trial is still under way. Though the chamber is full he sends a note to the judge that identifies him as the Mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer and as such eligible to sit in one of the chairs reserved for public functionaries next to the judge's bench. The judge readily assents and after a moment of hesitation Jean Valjean enters the courtroom. He notices that the man on trial did resemble him though he appeared older, more haggard and simpler than Jean Valjean. The defense attorney wraps up his case by declaring that there is simply no way to convict the man of stealing the apples and that his refusal to give his real identity is the result of stupidity and confusion. Champmathieu declares that he doesn't know the man his is supposed to be and relates the unhappy details of his life and expresses regret that they cannot find anyone to identify him. In response the prosecuting attorney insists on recalling the three fellow convicts who previously identified the man as Jean Valjean. Because Javert has already departed, the attorney reads his statement that leaves no doubt that he believes the man to be Jean Valjean. The three witnesses each take their turn and reiterate their claim that the man calling himself Champmathieu is really the convict Jean Valjean. Just as the prosecuting attorney is about to sum up the case there is an emotional voice from near the judge's bench that calls for the convicts to look in the speaker's direction. The man known to many as Father Madeleine walks to the center of the hall, trembling slightly, and beseeches the convicts to recognize him. He exclaims that he is the convict Jean Valjean and the accused man should be set free. The prosecuting attorney, believing that Mayor Madeleine has gone mad, calls for a doctor but Jean Valjean insists on his identity and proves it by revealing a thing about each of the convicts that only a previous associate could know. The courtroom is entirely silent as Jean Valjean announces that he has many important things to do and as he has not been arrested he will leave. Before he leaves he declares that he is at the prosecuting attorney's disposal. One hour later the man named Champmathieu is acquitted and leaves believing that all men are crazy.
	Analysis
	There is no longer any doubt about Madeleine's true identity. The chapter is devoted to Valjean's inner struggle as to whether he should reveal himself and forsake the town for the sake of one individual.
	Hugo, who has previously denounced the penal system, now critizes the judicial system. He indicates how Champmathieu is the victim of circumstantial evidence and is not tried for the crime that he really committed.

Section 1 - Fantine
	Book Eight - Counter-Stroke
	Fantine passes a sleepless night but falls asleep at dawn. Sister Simplice is surprised soon afterward by the entrance of Father Madeleine who appears very haggard and worn. He insists upon seeing Fantine. Fantine awakes and Father Madeleine tells her that Cosette is safe and nearby but the physician insists that she may not see her daughter until she has recovered her health. The sound of a child playing outside causes Fantine to become joyful but she quickly becomes fearful when Javert, who has received orders to arrest the false mayor, enters the room. To the amazement of the nun and Fantine, Javert seizes the mayor by the collar and commands him to leave with him. Jean Valjean pleads in a low voice for the three days needed to fetch Fantine's child but Javert laughs and repeats his request loudly and mockingly thus informing Fantine that her daughter is not nearby. Javert goes on to proclaim that the man they know as Madeleine is really the convict Jean Valjean and he is under arrest. The emotion of the moment is too much for Fantine and she convulses and dies. Jean Valjean pries loose from Javert's grasp and wrenching an iron bar from an unused bed frame suggests to the police inspector that he should wait until he has paid his last respects to Fantine. He kisses her gently on the forehead and then allows Javert to take him to jail. Despite the good that Jean Valjean had done for the town nearly everyone abandons him except for the nuns and his old servant.
	On the evening of his arrest the old servant is surprised when the man she still considers the mayor comes inside. Jean Valjean has escaped from jail and asks the old woman to tell Sister Simplice to meet him in his room. Sister Simplice finds Jean Valjean packing the two candlesticks but they are soon interrupted by the sound of Javert downstairs and the servant's protests. Jean Valjean hides behind the door and when Javert asks Sister Simplice, whom he knows has never lied, if she is alone she answers ""Yes"" and then when he asks her if she has seen the mayor she answers ""No"". That evening a man fitting Jean Valjean's description is seen walking toward Paris. Fantine is later buried in a public pit.
	Analysis
	Hugo shows the fickle side of human nature. Forgetting the good that Madeleine has done for the town and all the people in it, everyone, except a few faithful friends, is very quick to jump on the band wagon and condemn him when his identity is revealed.

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book One - Waterloo
	This section details the events of the Battle of Waterloo which marked the final downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte and the dramatic restructuring of European power with the return of monarchy (though tempered by a republican parliament) to France. The narrator begins by describing the field of battle as it appeared on a visit he paid to the area in May of 1861. He describes the manor of Hougomont where Napoleon encountered the first English resistance, where the chapel was burned but the wooden Christ miraculously survived and where none will drink from the well because it is littered with the skeletons of the slain soldiers.
	The narrator then casts his story back to June 17th, 1815 just before the beginning of the battle. He describes the fate of Europe resting upon small chance happenings. Because it had rained the ground was too soft to commence the battle at dawn and Napoleon's artillery had to wait until half past eleven o'clock to take position. Though they were outnumbered, the English army under Wellington was above the French positions. By four o'clock in the afternoon things were going badly for the English and Napoleon believed they would soon retreat. Three thousand-five hundred French cavalry advanced upon the English position but because a peasant questioned by Napoleon had neglected to tell him of a sunken road, the cavalry faltered and fell into the open ditch where they were shelled by the hidden English artillery. The narrator makes the observation that God, not the English, defeated Napoleon. Though they stopped the initial cavalry assault, the situation remained desperate for the English and Wellington anxiously awaited the arrival of reinforcements from the German army under Blucher. Again, fate took a hand and Blucher's army arrived in time only because a peasant directed them to the correct road. With the arrival of the German army the tide turned irrevocably against the French who were soon reduced to a retreating rabble. The narrator gives the English army the credit over their commander whom he believes has been too much praised for the day's results. He characterizes Wellington as austere and precise and contrasts him with Napoleon who had carried many battles by taking chances and displaying individual bravado. He criticizes the English need for hierarchy and hereditary right. He calls the Battle of Waterloo a ""counter-revolutionary"" victory, that of the European monarchies over the French Revolution though he admits that Revolution and Progress, once begun, can never be entirely erased.
	The narrator relates that the night after the battle a corpse robber was moving among the fallen soldiers when, in the sunken road, he spied a hand with a gold ring protruding from a mass of fallen men and horses. After taking the ring he was surprised to find life left in the hand and pulled the man from the mass. The man was an officer with a silver cross of the Legion of Honor and a huge saber gash across his face. The robber quickly took the man's watch and purse. This action awakened the man who having learned that the English were victorious commands his rescuer to take his watch and purse as reward but the robber reports that they are missing. A patrol approaches and the robber, claiming to be a sergeant in the French army, says he has saved the other man's life but that he must now flee. The officer thanks him and asks his name to which the robber replies that it is Thenardier and the officer responds that his is Pontmercy.
	Analysis
	This chapter is a detailed account of the Battle of Waterloo and Hugo combines historical facts with fiction. The underhanded character of Thenardier is again shown in complete contrast to the honest and forthright behavior of Valjean. It is ironic how one is rewarded and gains appreciation whereas the other is punished.",Les Miserables

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Two - The Ship Orion
	By using a couple of newspaper articles the narrator relates that Jean Valjean was recaptured boarding a carriage that runs between Paris and Montfermeil and that before his recapture he withdrew a large sum (between five hundred and six hundred thousand francs) and hid them. The second article relates that he was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted to life of hard labor on the galleys at Toulon.
	The narrator then goes on to relate the superstition held among the people of Montfermeil that the devil buries treasure in the their woods but death is the reward for those who seek to unearth what the devil has buried. One evening after Jean Valjean's escape an old road mender named Boulatruelle passed a man carrying a wooden box and digging implements. Later he espied the same man, whom he recognized from the galleys, leaving the woods but bereft of the box. He searched in vain for what he imagined was the buried treasure but to no avail.
	In October of 1823 the naval ship Orion put into harbor at Toulon for repairs. During the course of the work a man fell from the main topsail but managed to catch a rope where he swung close to falling into the sea and certain death. None of the sailors wanted to risk their own lives to save him. A white-haired convict working on the ship requested permission to rescue the man and quickly broke his chains, climbed the mainsail, rescued the man and then fell into the sea himself. No trace of him was found and he was presumed dead. The convict was Jean Valjean.
	Analysis
	In this section we again see the true nature of Jean Valjean when he is the only one who volunteers to rescue the sailor even though he has been shunned and convicted by society. We silently cheer him on when we realize that he has seized an opportunity to escape by falling back into the sea an dpretending to have drowned.

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Three - Fulfillment of the Promise Made to the Departed
	Cosette was eight years old in 1823 and had become the abused servant of the Thenardiers. Monsieur Thenardier was crafty, cheap, heavily in debt and affected an air of learning. His wife was large, ugly and cared only for her two daughters. She obeyed her husband in everything and neglected her infant son. Near Christmas of 1823 the little town was unusually festive owing to the presence of some seasonal performers from Paris and their attendant peddlers of dolls and festive wares. The evening of Christmas day, Cosette, miserable, thin and ill clothed, was called to bring water for a peddler's horse from the spring which lay fifteen minute's walk down a dark road. Cosette shook with fear at the thought of walking that path alone. Nevertheless, the cold hearted Thenardiess ordered her to take a bucket, almost as big as Cosette, and go to the spring and then, giving her a fifteen-sous piece, ordered her to buy a loaf of bread on the way home. Outside the tavern Cosette was momentarily enraptured by the sight of a beautiful doll in a traveling merchant's stall but she soon fled at the sound of the Thenardiess. She ran through the dreaded dark woods and eventually reached the spring. While she filled her bucket she did not notice that the fifteen-sous piece fell into the water. She struggled to lift the bucket and began to walk back to the village. The weight of the water combined with the cold and her malnutrition caused to falter and she leaned against a tree in despair. A man approached unseen and lifted the weight of the bucket and carried it for her. Cosette was not afraid.
	On the walk back to the tavern the man questions the little girl and learns all the sad details of her life. He seems shocked when he learns that her name is Cosette. Upon arriving at the tavern Cosette asks for the bucket so she will not be beaten. The man asks for a room and the Thenardiess, seeing his bedraggled clothing, at first refuses and then asks for twice the normal amount. The man pays in advance. While he waits for dinner he watches Cosette with rapt attention. When the Thenardiess demands the bread, Cosette lies and says that the baker was closed. When the Thenardiess demands the fifteen-sous piece Cosette turns white with fear when she realizes that it is gone. Before the woman can beat the child, however, the stranger pretends to pick up a silver piece from the floor and, though it is more than the lost coin, offers it as the missing piece. The two well-kept daughters, Eponine and Azelma enter and begin playing with a doll. Cosette wistfully watches them but resumes work upon some stockings for the girls when the Thenardiess threatens to beat her. The stranger buys the stockings and then commands Cosette to play since her work now belongs to him. The daughters catch Cosette playing with their doll and their mother threatens to beat her but the stranger leaves and then returns holding the magnificent doll from the stall across the street. To the shock of all present he gives the doll to Cosette who, partly in awe and partly in ecstasy, accepts the gift and announces that she will call the doll Catherine. The Thenardiess has formed an intense hatred for the stranger and soon afterward sends all the children to bed. Thenardier, who has formed the opinion that the stranger might be an eccentric rich man, stays awake until three in the morning watching him and then, instead of the promised stall, conducts him to the finest room in the house. Later in the night the stranger creeps down to the room where Cosette sleeps and observes her clutching the doll on her worn mattress. He also sees that the children have placed their shoes on the fireplace for Father Christmas to leave coins and that both Eponine and Azelma's shoes contain a ten-sous piece. Cosette's wooden clog is empty and in it the stranger places a gold Louis coin.
	In the morning Thenardier draws up a ridiculously large bill for the stranger and instructs his wife to present it to him. The stranger takes the bill but hardly notices it. He requests permission to take Cosette with him and the Thenardiess, who is ready to get rid of the girl, accepts his offer with enthusiasm. He then notices the large bill but places the money on the table and instructs the woman to call for the girl. Thenardier, who has heard the exchange and gleaned an opportunity, enters, returns the stranger's money and takes him aside. Thenardier claims to have great affection for Cosette, whom he calls the Lark, and is unwilling to part with her. The stranger insists on taking her but Thenardier responds that he must have fifteen hundred francs. The stranger immediately places the money on the table and again commands that Cosette be brought to him. The Thenardiess brings her and the stranger unties a package that contains the complete morning dress and undergarments for a girl of seven years age.
	Later, after the stranger and Cosette have departed, Thenardier shows his wife the fifteen hundred francs and she scoffs at the amount. He readily agrees that he should have gotten more and pursues them. Some distance from the town he catches up and tries to return the money and reacquire Cosette under the pretense that he needs a signed order from the mother to release her. The stranger, who is of course Jean Valjean, produces the note he obtained from Fantine. Thenardier is taken aback but insists that because the note promises that the bearer will settle all small debts he is due more money. Jean Valjean sternly details to Thenardier all the money he has received and points out that he was only owed thirty-five francs but has received fifteen hundred. Thenardier demands a thousand crowns and Jean Valjean simply takes Cosette's hand and leaves the weaker man behind. He and Cosette arrive in Paris that night.
	Analysis
	This chapter reintroduces Cosette and reemphasizes her miserable living conditions. It is very interesting to note the difference in personality between Valjean who is a kind and caring individual and feels empathy for Cosette even before he knows who she really is and the Thenardiers who are greedy and will go to any length to obtain money, even to the point of selling a child.

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Four - The Old Gorbeau House
	Jean Valjean carries Cosette to an old house on the outskirts of the city that is known locally as the Old Gorbeau House. Using a passkey he enters the house and ascends to a garret room that contains bare furnishings but a warm stove. He places the sleeping Cosette on a cot bed with her doll and kisses the child's hand. Thus begins a relationship of mutual love and understanding between the reformed convict and the unloved orphan girl. He feels as though Cosette were his own daughter and she regards him as nothing less than the only true parent she has ever known. The only other occupant of the house is an old woman who does the cleaning and shopping. Jean Valjean ventures out only at night and is often mistaken for a beggar, just as often he is seen giving alms to beggars in the street. The old woman that keeps the house is nosy and one day spies her lodger removing a thousand-franc bill from the lining of his old coat. Soon afterward Jean Valjean is giving alms to a beggar in the neighborhood when he looks into the man's face and for a moment thinks he sees Javert. He is startled by the vision but reassures himself that it is certainly not his old nemesis. Several days later, while giving Cosette her spelling lesson, a man comes up the stairs and listens at their door. The next day Jean Valjean learns from the landlady that a new lodger has taken a room in the house. Apprehensive that this man might be Javert, Valjean flees the house with Cosette at dusk.
	Analysis
	Although it appears that all is going well for Valjean, he cannot stop feeling that Javert was again on his trail. In actuality he is right. Unwittingly, his generous acts of giving money to beggars on the street even though he was dressed like one himself and being seen with a small child at his side, have drawn attention to himself.

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Five - A Dark Chase Requires A Silent Hound
	Jean Valjean with Cosette in tow flees among the labyrinth of streets. By the light of the full moon he can see if anyone is following them. He is not sure that the man was Javert, and he does not know where he is going, but he is resolved never to return to the Gorbeau house. Soon after passing a police station he notices that three men are following him and he increases his pace. Eventually four men are following them and Jean Valjean recognizes Javert at their head. He crosses the river at the bridge of Austerlitz and later observes the four pursuers crossing as well. Eventually he finds himself trapped in a street with a squad of soldiers approaching. He uses his skills and strength as a former convict to fashion a rope from a street lamp pulley and scales a wall pulling Cosette after him. As the troops enter the street behind them, Cosette and Jean Valjean drop into a walled garden. Some time passes as the two listen to the sounds of the troop fade. Suddenly they are both surprised to hear the sound of unearthly singing coming from one of the buildings facing the garden. More time passes and Jean Valjean explores the garden. He raises himself to a window and is terrified by the sight of a prostrate figure with a rope around its neck. He flees not knowing what sort of house he has dropped into. He returns to Cosette who has fallen asleep and then he hears the sound of a small tinkling bell approaching and sees a figure moving among the melon patch. Fearful of discovery he checks Cosette and finds that she has become ice cold. Resolved to save the child he walks directly up to the figure and offers a hundred francs in exchange for refuge. Much to Valjean's astonishment the figure addresses him as Father Madeleine. Jean Valjean learns that this man is none other than old Fauchelevant whom he saved from the cart and the place is none other than the convent of the Petit Picpus where the old man serves as a gardener. The bell is to warn the nuns to stay away. Jean Valjean quickly secures the Fauchelevent's confidence and the old man is happy to help. They get Cosette and take her to the gardener's meager quarters where she is soon warm and sleeping soundly by a fire.
	At this point the narrator interjects with the details of how Javert came to rediscover Jean Valjean. Javert had been called to Paris to recapture the escaped Valjean and later read of the convict's death but his suspicion had been rekindled when he heard of a child kidnapped from Montfermeil. He traveled there but Thenardier had changed his story in order to avoid suspicion and claimed it was the girl's grandfather who had taken her. Javert then heard of the beggar who gave alms and lived with a girl from Montfermeil. He had adopted the guise of a beggar and soon learned that it was Jean Valjean. He had called for assistance in the pursuit but had not revealed the convict's identity so as not to raise alarm and to increase his own reputation if he succeeded and because he liked surprises. When he was sure of success he closed his net but Jean Valjean once again eluded him
	Analysis
	Javert's search for Valjean has taken on a fanatical format and appears to fully occupy his days. His efforts to recapture Valjean become outlandish and he can no longer be viewed as an officer of the law but rather as one who has a personal vendetta towards Valjean. This is underscored when he does not even show the slightest concern about Cosette and that she may have been kidnapped.
	The meeting with Fauchelevent seems to be too coincidental and out of place with the rest of realism that is found throughout the book, however, Hugo wants to emphasize the fact that good deeds do not go unrewarded and that Fauchelevent will now be able to repay Valjean and help him.",Les Miserables

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Six - Petit-Picpus
	This book describes all the particulars of the convent of the Bernadines of the Perpetual Adoration into which Jean Valjean and Cosette had fallen. The entrance was an otherwise cheerful door on the street that admitted to a small room with a bell rope. If the entrant were expected they would be allowed to pass into a sort of theater box made of iron bars from which they could converse with but not see the subject of their visit. It was a heavily shielded cloister and only a select few besides its residents had ever seen the interior. The strict rules of the order dictated clothing that completely concealed the figure, abstinence from meat and frequent fasting, rising at one o'clock in the morning for nightly prayers, coarse woolen sheets all year round, no baths or fires and a haircloth chemise for six months out of the year. At all times there was a sister on her knees before the holy sacrament. Each one performs what they called ""the reparation"" which involved a twelve-hour prayer on her knees upon the stone, hands clasped and a rope around her neck. Her only relief was to prostrate herself on the ground. They lived communally and are allowed no privacy. A boarding school for girls was attached to the convent and its pupils strictly shielded from the outside world until they left. The convent also had a vault for the deceased but the government forbade private burial and, much to the horror and consternation of the nuns, they were forced to give over their deceased to an official who buried them in a private cemetery off-premise.
	Analysis
	The convent follows an extremely strict order and does not allow men on the premise, however, with the help of Faucheleven, Valjean and Cosette are able to find temporary sanctuary at the convent until a more permanent paln could be formulated.",Les Miserables

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Seven - A Parenthesis
	The author uses this section to muse upon the meaning of convents. He notes that while they exist in all societies in one form or another, and have sublime aspirations, they are nevertheless detestable in the light of Progress and history. He cites the medieval practices of suffering that accompanied the monastic life and asserts that though these institutions had their role in furthering civilization their usefulness has long since passed. He also discusses the nature of prayer, since that it the chief-object of most convents. He concludes that faith is absolutely necessary to mankind though it must not come at the expense of the mind and abuse of the body.

	Hugo reveals his disdain of extreme religious institutions in present-day society and feels that they have lost their usefulness.

Section 2 - Cosette
	Book Eight - Cemeteries Take What is Given Them
	Jean Valjean and Old Fauchelevent pass a sleepless night. Valjean worries about Javert and determines that he must find a way to stay in the convent. Old Fauchelevent wonders how Father Madeleine got into the convent and about the identity of the little girl who is with him. In the end he resolves that he will do everything he can to protect the man who saved his life.
	At daybreak they consult and Fauchelevent observes that since one of the sisters is on her deathbed and the nuns do not look at the gardener's shack out of habit, they will not be discovered so long as Father Madeleine and Cosette do not leave the shack. Old Fauchelevent's only concern is that one of the little girls from the school will discover them. They hear the sound of a bell knelling and know that the sister has died.
	After some more conversation it becomes clear that in order for Madeleine and Cosette to stay they must first leave so that the nuns know how they came to be there. Fauchelevent observes that it will be easy enough to sneak Cosette out in a basket but the problem will be to effect the removal of Madeleine. Though Valjean is reluctant to leave, he sees Fauchelevant's point. The Prioress summons Fauchelevent and once he is in her presence he petitions that his brother and niece may come to live with him and help in his work. Without addressing Fauchelevent's petition, the Prioress asks him to assist in the illegal burial of the deceased nun who requested to be buried in her own coffin in the convent's crypt. Fauchelevent humbly agrees and offers to fill the government-supplied coffin with earth before he nails it up so that the bearers will not suspect that it is empty. The Prioress is pleased and tells Fauchelevent to bring his brother and niece to see her the next day.
	When Fauchelevent returns to his shack, he and Jean Valjean ponder over the best way to get Valjean out of the convent so he can return. As soon as Fauchelevent tells him of the plan to bury the nun in the crypt and the problem of the unused coffin, Jean Valjean asserts that he will occupy the coffin. They work out the scheme and Fauchelevent describes the drunkard who normally helps him cover the coffin with dirt. He explains that once the priest has departed, he will take this man to a pub and then take his entry card to the cemetery and use it to retrieve Jean Valjean. If the man is already drunk he will tell him to leave and then free his friend. The plan goes smoothly until the coffin arrives at the graveyard and Fauchelevent discovers that a new man has come to assist with the gravedigging. He is very serious and refuses to accompany the increasingly desperate Fauchelevent to the pub. He begins to dump soil on the lowered coffin and inside Jean Valjean loses consciousness. Fauchelevent offers to pay for the drinks but the man insists on doing his duty so that his seven children will have food. In a moment of inspiration Fauchelevent lifts the man's entry card from his pocket and then asks if he has it. The gravedigger becomes distraught when he discovers it missing and knows he will have to pay a fine. Fauchelevent suggests that the man run home to find it while he watches the coffin. The thankful man readily assents. Fauchelevent unearths Jean Valjean who appears dead but soon recovers. They bury the empty coffin, drop the gravedigger's card in the porter's box and walk to the gravedigger's house where the anxious man has torn apart his apartment looking for the card. To the man's eternal gratitude Fauchelevent explains that he found the card, left it with the porter and did the man's job.
	The next day Jean Valjean is admitted as the convent's second gardener, Ultimus Fauchelevent, and Cosette is accepted into the school. The nuns take a liking to Cosette because they believe she will grow up homely and therefore pure. Jean Valjean keeps the clothes he had bought for Cosette in a small valise. The convent was like an island in the city to them and for the time being Cosette is happy.
	Analysis
	Once again Valjean finds a new life by staging a death for himself. He and Cosette are able to stay at the Convent and begin a new life.

Section 3 - Marius
	Book One - Paris Atomized
	This section begins about eight or nine years later. It introduces the character of a gamin, a free-spirited homeless boy of the Paris streets who has transcended the predicament of poverty and claimed the city for himself. This particular gamin was about twelve years old and though he had a father and mother, they did not love him and he did not live with them. He was homeless but he was free. Every so often, however, he would go to see his mother. His parents, who called themselves Jondrette, lived in the Old Gorbeau house with nearly two grown daughters. Unlike the time during which Cosette and Jean Valjean lived there, the house was now occupied by several tenants. A very poor young man named Monsieur Marius lived in the adjacent room.
	Analysis
	The chapter focuses on the homeless, abandoned children of Paris who survive on the streets. These children are known as ""gamins"" and their tragic existence is vividly portrayed.
	Gavroche, the son of the Thenardiers, is a gutter child even though his family is alive. His parents did not want him and he became homeless.

	Book Two - The Grand Bourgeois
	This book describes the household of Monsieur Gillenormand, a grand old man of more than ninety years of age whose habits and mannerisms were those of the 18th century. He had an unmarried daughter of more than fifty years of age who lived with him and whom he verbally abused on a regular basis. He was a true royalist and had nothing but contempt for revolutionaries. His younger daughter had died at age thirty. She had brought disgrace to the family by marrying a soldier of the Republic who had fought for Napoleon at Austerlitz and been made a colonel at Waterloo. The older daughter was a prude but loved her grandnephew, an officer of the lancers named Theodule. In this household there was also a young boy (the son of the younger daughter and her soldier husband) who was timid and mute before his grandfather.
	Analysis
	M. Gillenormand is an ardent supporter of the Bourbons in complete contrast to his daughter who married Pontmercy, a supporter of Napoleon. Gillenormand's beliefs are so strong that he disowns his daughter as a result of these political differences and when she dies, he forces Pontmercy to turn his child over to him. Being poor, Pontmercy concedes and Gillenormand raises his grandson, Marius, to hate his father and his father's beliefs.

	Monsieur Gillenormand frequented many of the most fashionable salons. His grandson often accompanied him on these visits and was duly praised for his beauty and pitied for his father - the soldier whom Monsieur Gillenormand considered the disgrace of the family.
	This soldier was an old man living in the little city of Vernon on the banks of the Seine where he tended to his rich garden of flowers. He bore a ragged scar on this cheek from the battle of Waterloo. Although he was friendly if approached he did not seek human company and remained close only with his cure, Abbe Mabeuf. This old soldier's name was Pontmercy and he had, in his long life, been in many of the most significant military engagements of his time and had been wounded on numerous occasions. Moreover, he had distinguished himself in many of them. On the field of Waterloo, Napoleon had given him the title of Baron and made him an Officer of the Legion of Honour. Later he plummeted into the sunken road, was extricated by Thenardier and after the battle was put on half-pay by the Restoration government. He wore the colors of his battlefield appointment illegally and always insisted on his title as that of Baron. Monsieur Gillenormand took his son by threatening to disown the child from his inheritance. Pontmercy obeyed believing it was in the child's best interest. Though he longed to, Pontmercy was never allowed to interact with his son.
	The boy, Marius, grew up to be a very serious young man who was embarrassed by his grandfather's gaiety and cynicism but who shared his royalist sensibilities. He knew almost nothing of his father except that he was considered a disgrace. At the age of eighteen Marius had just entered law school when one evening his grandfather informed him that he must go visit his sick father who has sent for him. Both Monsieur Gillenormand and Marius regard this as a distasteful expedition but Marius dutifully traveled to Vernon the following day.
	Marius arrived at his father's humble house and found that the old man had already died. He was unmoved by the sight of his dead father. The doctor, priest and servant were very upset by Pontmercy's death. The servant handed Marius a note from the old man addressed to him. It tells Marius that although the Restoration denies the title, he (Pontmercy) trusts that Marius will bear the title of Baron Pontmercy well. He also tells his son that a sergeant named Thenardier saved him and that he is to render good service to this man should he ever meet him. Marius returned to his grandfather's house and thought no more of his father.
	Some time later Marius is attending mass at Saint Sulpice when he accidentally takes a seat reserved for Monsieur Mabeuf, the churchwarden. Mabeuf soon appears and Marius readily yields the seat. After the service Mabeuf explains to Marius that he always likes to sit in that spot because it was from there that he regularly watched a devoted father observe his son who was parted from him by family disagreements. Marius and Mabeuf, who is the brother of Pontmercy's cure, conclude that Marius was that little boy and Mabeuf assures him that his father loved him.
	The next day, Marius, under the pretense of a hunting trip which his grandfather suspects to be a love affair, leaves for several days. During this time he researches his father's history and meets his cure. He becomes enraptured of his father and at the same time undergoes a political revolution as well and comes into sympathy with the Republic and his father's principles. He has calling cards printed that read Baron Marius Pontmercy but keeps them in his pocket.
	He comes to dislike his grandfather who persists in believing that his grandson is engaged in amorous pursuits. The daughter and Monsieur Gillenormand notice that Marius is wearing a heavy amulet under his shirt.
	Marius travels to Montfermiel but can find no trace of Thenardier. On one occasion the daughter has her grandnephew follow Marius to discover the object of his love. He does so and discovers that Marius is visiting the grave of his father. Soon afterward, Monsieur Gillenormand discovers the amulet that Marius wears and brings it to his daughter. They open it and instead of the expected love letter discover the letter from Pontmercy and Marius' calling cards. Eventually Marius appears before them, there is a row which results in Marius being exiled from the house. Soon after Marius leaves, Monsieur Gillenormand commands his daughter to send Marius some money each month and never to speak of him again.
	The note from Pontmercy is accidentally lost in the process and Marius believes, incorrectly, that his grandfather has cruelly destroyed his one link to his father. He resolves never to return. Upon leaving he possesses thirty francs, his watch and some clothes. He hires a cabriolet and with no clear destination in mind directs the driver to proceed to the Latin Quarter.
	Analysis
	Gillenormand cannot bear to see Marius follow an opposing political viewpoint and chooses to sever ties with him. His stubbornness costs him the relationship with his grandson.
	Marius' interests in the Napoleonic values reflect the younger generation's desire to follow democratic principles and change the stoic Bourbon beliefs.

Section 3 - Marius
	Book Four - The Friends of the A B C
	This book serves to introduce the members and habits of a secret society that met at a wine shop called Corinth and a coffeehouse called Le Cafe Musain. The ABC society consisted of mostly young students and some sympathetic workingmen. They held as their basic principle the uplift of the masses and in this way mirrored the vague revolutionary thrill that was growing at the time. The group's leader was Enjolras who at twenty-two years of age was very serious and passionate on the subject of the rights of man. His compatriot was Combeferre who represented the philosophy of their organization and touted the need for civilization instead of revolution. Other members included Jean Prouvaire who was addicted to love, Feuilly who was in love with nationality, Courfeyrac who was the group's center, Bahorel who had vowed never to become a lawyer, Bahorel who loafed, Bousset who was bald and the others called Lesgle or Laigle de Meuax and who was studying law and laughed at everything especially his own numerous failings, Joly who was studing medicine and was a hypochondriac and Granataire who was a drunk and a skeptic and who remained with the group because he venerated Enjolras.
	One day Laigle is loafing in front of the Cafe Musain when he noticed a young man in a cabriolet and recognized the name Marius Pontmercy stitched on the man's traveling bag. He hails Marius and good-naturedly explains that they are fellow students in a particular course and that because Marius was absent the previous day he, Laigle, answered for him at roll but was accordingly marked off the roll when his own name was called. Marius begins to apologize but Laigle assures him that he is very happy not to become a lawyer. Courfeyrac joins them and learns that Marius has nowhere to go. He offers to share his apartment with him. They become friends and several days later Courfeyrac takes Marius to meet the ABC at the Cafe Musain. At the caf�, Marius experiences the fiery opinions of revolutionaries and feels his own political convictions beginning to sway. Marius makes several visits to the Cafe and gives a passionate defense of Napoleon. To his question: ""To conquer the world twice, by conquest and by resplendence, this is sublime, and what can be more grand?"" Combeferre answers simply: ""To be free."" His argument deflated Marius decides that he will no longer visit the Cafe. One morning the landlady of the house where he lives with Courfeyrac demands Marius' share of the rent. Courfeyrac helps Marius sell some of his clothes and his gold watch. After paying the landlady Marius is left only ten francs. He resolves to learn German and English so that he can get work from a friend of Courfeyrac who is compiling an encyclopedia in those languages. In the midst of these financial crises Marius receives six hundred francs from his Aunt but returns the money stating that he can provide for himself. Not wanting to offend the grandfather who has forbidden the use of Marius' name, the Aunt says nothing to him. Marius leaves his friend's apartment for cheaper lodgings.
	Analysis
	Marius' discussions with the student group make him aware of the divisions that exist in Paris in the 1800's and that he doesn't fully know his own beliefs or loyalties.

Section 3 - Marius
	Book Five - The Excellence of Misfortune
	Marius embarks upon a meager existence. He comforts himself with his bitterness toward his grandfather and in his poverty learns to bear the gibes of society. Years pass. He manages to complete law school but relies upon his work as a translator to provide his income. He takes a room with no fireplace at the Gorbeau tenement. After his expenses he is left with fifty francs a year in free income and he considers himself rich. He occasionally lends money to his friends. He has two suits, one ragged and the other in decent shape. Both the suits are black.
	Although he has not lost his resolve to find Thenardier his attempts to locate the man are unsuccessful. By the time he takes the room at the Gorbeau house, Marius is twenty years old. He had not had any contact with his Grandfather except to send him a letter once he had finished law school. Marius is convinced that his Grandfather never loved him but in fact the old man had a deep affection for Marius but his pride would not allow the world to see his grief at their separation.
	Marius leads a more or less solitary existence. Though he remains friendly with Enjolras and the ABC group he is not considered a member. His only two friends are Courfeyrac and the brother of his father's cure, Monsieur Mabeuf. Monsieur Mabeuf is a passionate horticulturist and had written and published a Flora of the Environs of Chauteretz an esteemed work for which he owns the plates and sells copies. He is a collector of books and unknowingly furthers Marius' own political development with his philosophy that places the affairs of the mind above those of the world.
	Around 1830 Monsieur Mabeuf's brother dies and his notary fails and costs him his life savings of ten thousand francs. He moves to a simple cottage with his old servant woman. Marius visits him a couple times a month at his new dwelling. Soon after Marius moves to the Gorbeau house, the landlady informs him that his neighbors, the Jondrette family, is going to be turned out for twenty francs of back rent. Marius, who has only thirty francs, gives the landlady twenty-five francs, and tells her to give the family the extra five francs but instructs her not tell from where the money came.
	About this time it happened that the regiment to which Lieutenant Theodule (Aunt Gillenormand's nephew and Monsieur Gillenormand's grandnephew) became stationed in Paris. The Aunt had always favored this boy and contrived to have him supplant Marius in his grandfather's affections. Accordingly the young lancer called one day and was told by his Aunt to agree to everything his grandfather said. Monsieur Gillenormand was passionately denouncing the intentions of a group of students (which he believed that Marius would join) that were to meet and debate the government. To his every statement the grandnephew agreed. At the end of the interview the Grandfather looked his grandnephew in the eye and stated ""You are a fool.""
	Analysis
	Marius has learned to fend for himself and appears to have become a better person for it. Even though he is poor, he readily helps others. He also is determined to stick to his convictions and refuses to accept money from his grandfather.

Section 3 - Marius
	Book Six - The Conjunction of Two Stars
	This book begins with the observation that Marius had grown into a good-looking young man whose appearance at times achieved a sublime grace. Young girls would turn to watch him when he passed and though they actually dreamed about him, Marius believed that they were mocking his worn clothes. He avoided all female companionship.
	Marius was fond of taking long walks and often walked in the Luxembourg. He noticed that a man and young girl of about fourteen often sat on a bench at the far end of the path. The man, whom Marius assumed was the girl's father, had white hair and dressed in coarse but clean clothing. The young girl wore an ill-fitting dress of black merino, typical of those worn by schoolgirls in convents. Courfeyrac who also noticed them nicknamed them Mademoiselle Lanoire (black) and Monsieur Leblanc (white). For a period of about six months Marius does not visit the Luxembourg and when he returns he notices that the girl has blossomed into a woman in her fifteenth year. Marius, without quite realizing what is happening, is smitten by her. He gets into the habit of only wearing his good suit for his walks in the Luxembourg and finds himself unable to walk near the girl. He spends hours gazing at her from afar and becomes increasingly distracted.
	One day Marius excitedly notices that the pair was approaching him. As they pass he sees that the young girl is looking steadily, almost reproachfully at him. He falls completely in love with her. A month passes during which time he spends every afternoon at the park in various strategically chosen locations that allow him to watch the girl without seeing the father. Eventually the father notices the young man's intentions and he tests Marius by moving to another seat to see if Marius would follow and coming without the girl to see if Marius would stay. Marius fell for both traps.
	On another occasion, he found a handkerchief marked with the initials ""U.F."" He believes it is the girl's who had left it for him. He cherished it and tried to puzzle out her name which he takes to be Ursula. The handkerchief actually belongs to the old man who accidentally dropped it and the young girl fails to understand why the young man bestows kisses upon a handkerchief while looking at her. They continue to see each other at the garden and one day Marius follows them home. He talks to the porter and learns that they live on the third floor and that the man, though not rich, does a great deal for the poor. Soon afterward Marius noticed that the man casts a severe look at him and then he and the girl fail to appear at the garden. Eventually Marius goes back to their house and learns that they have moved and left no forwarding address.
	Analysis
	The title of this book refers to Marius and Cosette who are attracted to each other. Both are very young and immature in the art of flirting and do not know how to mask their feelings. It is almost comical to see Marius trying to arouse Cosette's emotions by kissing a handkerchief which doesn't even belong to her.

Section 3 - Marius
	Book Eight - The Noxious Poor
	Both summer and autumn pass and Monsieur Leblanc and the young girl fail to return to the park. Marius becomes increasingly morose and thinks of nothing but his lost love. Only he and the Jondrette family remain as lodgers in the Gorbeau house but Marius is barely aware of their existence. One day he passes two girls in the street who in the city slang are called argot. They make such an exchange that Marius realizes they have just eluded the police. He finds a packet of letters they dropped in their flight and that evening, when he remembers the packet, discovers that the letters are each an appeal for money from various sources and pretend to be from different writers.
	He thinks nothing more of it until the next morning when the eldest daughter of the Jondrette family comes with a letter from her father begging for some money to feed his family. Marius recognizes the handwriting as that of the packet he found. Meanwhile the Jondrette girl, though much worn in appearance and bearing a rough voice, flatters herself by looking in the mirror and showing off her ability to read. She also shows off her ability to write by scribbling on a sheet of paper ""The Cognes [police] are here."" She exclaims that Marius is a pretty boy and says she admires his hair. He coldly returns her letters and she is overjoyed at the thought that she might get something to eat from them. She says that sometimes she leaves and doesn't come home for several days and that one winter her family lived under a bridge and she wanted to kill herself. Marius perceives the misery of her condition and gives her his last five francs.
	The girl leaves and Marius ponders the wretched poverty that exists in the world. He notices, for the first time, that the wall between his apartment and theirs is paper-thin and that there is a hole at the top. He climbs to the top of his bureau to look through the hole and sees the filthy room occupied by the Jondrette family. In the center of the room is a hideous looking man of about sixty with a long beard and wearing a rag-tag collection of clothes. He sits over some paper and writing utensils and smokes his pipe. A big woman squats near the fireplace, which contains two meek embers, and in the corner on a pallet he notices the youngest daughter. Marius is about to lower himself when the door to the Jondrette's room opens and the eldest daughter rushes in to exclaim that, though he reacted strangely to the address, the wealthy philanthropist of the church of Saint Jacques is coming to see them. This information causes the father to make his home environment appear to be as poverty-stricken as possible in an attempt to arouse pity. He douses the fire, breaks the chair, tells his wife to get into bed and orders his youngest daughter to break one of the panes of glass in their window to allow the cold winter air into the apartment. She does this and cuts her hand in the task.
	Soon the philanthropist knocks at the door and Marius is astounded to see Monsieur Leblanc and his daughter enter the room. While the Jondrette father, in the guise of a failed actor called Fabantou, pleads his case, Marius is overcome at the sight of his beloved. He sees all that occurs and notices that Monsieur Jondrette seems to look oddly at the gentleman and whispers to his wife to take a special look at him. The girls look enviously upon Leblanc's daughters' rich clothes. Although the man gives Jondrette a bundle of clothing he claims that he needs sixty francs to pay back rent. Monsieur Leblanc gives him five francs and promises to return alone at 6pm to give him sixty francs. Jondrette is overjoyed by the news.
	Marius sets out in pursuit of the Leblanc's, but cannot keep pace. He tries to hire a cab to follow but the driver demands money up front and Marius, because he gave his last money to the Jondrette girl, lacks the funds. He is crestfallen and trudges home. On the way he notices the Jondrette father engaged in a hushed conversation with a man Marius knows to be a notorious bandit.
	Back at his apartment the elder Jondrette daughter pays him a visit and perceives that he is sad. She offers to help and Marius asks her to find the address of the man that visited her family that afternoon and she immediately, and somewhat sadly, realizes that he wants the address of the beautiful young lady. He promises her whatever she wants if she procures the address and she promises to locate it for him. She leaves but soon Marius overhears a conversation next door and raises himself to the hole in the wall. Monsieur Jondrette claims that the man that visited them is one the family met eight years before and that the daughter is also someone they know. The woman becomes very angry at the possibility but Jondrette assures her they will profit by the knowledge. He states that he is making plans that will ensure them wealth very soon and if the man refuses to pay they will execute him. Before he leaves to complete his plans he gives his wife the five francs from Marius, whom he refers to as their stupid neighbor and who he believes is out and will not return until his regular hour of 7pm. He commands his wife to have a charcoal fire ready and tells her not to spend the rest of the money on food because he will need it to purchase supplies at a hardware store. When he leaves it is 1pm.
	Without fully understanding what is to occur, Marius gleans that an ambush is being planned for Monsieur Leblanc and he decides to inform the police. On his way to the station he overhears two surly characters discussing a plan involving a group called ""Patron-Minette."" At the police station he is interviewed by an inspector who recognizes the address and, after hearing Marius' story, proclaims that Patron-Minette must have something to do with it. Marius relates the conversation he overheard on the way and the inspector develops a plan. He takes Marius' passkey and gives him two pistols. Marius is to watch the room and as soon as the plot has reached a boiling point he is to fire one of the pistols into the air. The noise will summon the inspector and his force. Marius agrees and before he leaves the inspector tells him that if he needs him before 6 o'clock he is to ask for him by name: Inspector Javert.
	By the time Marius returns to his room night has fallen. He sees that the Jondrette's have built a charcoal fire that burns red hot and makes their room look like a smithy. Jondrette prepares everything for the ambush and orders his daughters out to opposite ends of the street to stand sentry duty. Marius is nearly discovered when the eldest daughter enters his room to verify that he is absent. Later the wife comes to take chairs from his room but on both occasions he manages to remain undiscovered. Finally, Jondrette orders his wife to go to the bottom of the staircase to light the way for the philanthropist when he arrives.
	A chisel glows white hot in the fireplace and Marius perceives that Jondrette has also acquired a rope ladder and what appear to be some smith's tools. Marius removes one of the pistols and cocks it. Monsieur Leblanc arrives at exactly 6pm and puts the needed money on the table. Jondrette thanks him and the two sit and talk about the hard times that have befallen the family. While they talk several men enter the apartment and Jondrette tells his benefactor to ignore them. Jondrette attempts to distract Leblanc with a picture he wants to sell. Leblanc grows concerned about the men and when Jondrette asks how much he will pay for the picture, Leblanc observes that it is just a tavern sign worth about three francs. Jondrette demands a thousand crowns and at that moment three more men appear at the door armed with instruments of torture. Leblanc jumps to his feet and Jondrette explodes and wants to know if his guest remembers him. He proclaims that his name is really Thenardier, the innkeeper of Montfermeil, but Leblanc claims not to know him.
	Marius, on the point of firing the pistol is overwhelmed by the sudden knowledge that this despicable man is the one he has long sought for his dead father's sake. He is spellbound and watches in a state of painful indecision. Thenardier momentarily turns his back on Leblanc and the latter makes a desperate attempt to escape out the window but the robbers grab him. Marius is on the verge of firing the pistol when Thenardier calls out for them to do no harm to the prisoner. All of the robbers, except one who is passed out drunk, aid in tying the prisoner to the foot of the bed. Thenardier resumes his discussion in polite tones and points out that since the man has not cried for assistance he must not want the police involved. Thenardier demands two hundred thousand francs and for emphasis uncovers the chisel which glows hot in the stove. Thenardier has his prisoner write a letter to his daughter (whom Thenardier calls ""The Lark"") telling her to come immediately. The man claims that his name is Urbain Fabre and he signs U.F.
	Thenardier dispatches his wife and one of the robbers with the letter. His plan is to hold the daughter hostage while his prisoner gathers the two hundred thousand francs ransom. While they wait Marius resolves to free his beloved when she arrives but he soon learns that Thenardier intends to hold her at a separate location. Soon the Thenardiess returns with news that their prisoner has given them a false address. The prisoner, his bonds cut by a blade cleverly concealed in a hollowed out sou piece, springs from the bed and seizes the hot chisel. Though he is still tied by one leg to the bed he proclaims that none of them can make them do what they wish and he proves his point by burning his own arm with the chisel. Somewhat horrified the robbers resolve to kill him. Marius has a moment of desperate inspiration and throws into their midst the note scribbled earlier in the day by the eldest daughter (Eponine) that states: The Cognes are here. The Thenardiers and the robbers panic and are arguing over who is to flee by the rope ladder first when Javert enters.
	Javert had posted his men and ordered them to arrest the two girls. They had nabbed the youngest, Azelma but Eponine had escaped. Javert, with fifteen men in support, subdues the bandits. Thenardier tries to shoot Javert but the pistol misfires. The Thenardiess throws a large stone at Javert but he ducks and soon both Thenardiers are in handcuffs. Javert proceeds to name all the bandits, among which are some of the most notorious criminals of the Parisian underground. He orders the prisoner, the man Marius knows only as Monsieur Leblanc, untied but a moment later they realize that the prisoner has escaped down the rope ladder and Javert laments that he may have been the ""best one.""
	The following day a boy clad only in rags comes down the street singing a song at the top of his voice. He knocks furiously upon the door of the Gorbeau house but no one answers. An old woman approaches and berates the gamin who states that he has merely come to visit his family. The woman tells him that his family is all in prison and the child says ""Ah"" before singing his way back down the street.
	Analysis
	Book Eight develops the highlight of the ""Marius"" section when Thenardier plots to rob and kill Leblanc and Marius's discovers that his father's benefactor really is a crook. Hugo uses this chapter to reunite a number of different characters and he skillfully explains any questions the reader might have formulated up to this point.
	When Leblanc, (Valijean) is in danger, Marius is forced to make a decision as to where he should place his allegiance. As he is unable to completely turn his back on Thenardier because of his father's last wish, he still wants to save Valjean from being harmed. He does the next best thing and causes a commotion by throwing Eponine's letter into the room. This allows Valjean to escape.

Section 4 - Saint-Denis and Idyll of the Rue Plumet
	Book One - A Few Pages of History
	The narrator observes that the years between 1830 and 1832 mark some of the most striking events in history. The July Revolution of 1830 was a revolution of the bourgeoisie that sought to expand some freedoms while maintaining the status quo. The man who was made king, Louis Philippe, is described as a charming representation of the bourgeoisie class who carries an umbrella and had previously worked for his living. The ills of society continued unabated, however and by April of 1832 the extreme left wing thinkers and sympathizers, namely the students and workingmen, had become volatile and spoke of the necessity for a real revolution. The heart of this sentiment lay in the Fauborg Saint Antoine district of Paris where the wine shops and coffeehouses were used by secret societies to organize for the approaching conflict. Arms were gathered, ammunition manufactured, pamphlets distributed and leaders elected. At the Cafe Musain the ABC society meets and Enjolras appoints different members to go check on the readiness and willingness of various factions throughout the city. Much to everyone's surprise the ever cynical and usually drunken Grantaire volunteers to visit the artists of the Barriere du Maine and convert them to the cause. Enjolras has his doubts but allows Grantaire to take on the mission. Later Enjolras visits the smoking room where the artists of the Barriere du Maine gather and observes Grantaire engaged in a game of dominos.
	Analysis
	The causes and results of the July Revolution of 1830 are reviewed. It is evident that a lot of discontent still existed and that the extreme left wing thinkers are becoming stronger in numbers and more vocal. The sentiment that is being expressed is that a real revolution was necessary.

Section 4 - Saint-Denis and Idyll of the Rue Plumet
	Book Two - Eponine
	After Javert had left the Gorbeau house with his prisoners, Marius went to Courfeyrac's to spend the night. The next day he had his things moved to Courfeyrac's. He did not want to have to testify in court against Thenardier. He borrowed money from his friend in order to be able to send five francs a week anonymously to Thenardier in prison. Javert did not have Marius' name and had no way of being certain that he was even in the house at the time of the ambush. Months passed during which time Marius was uncertain concerning many things including the nature of Monsieur Leblanc and whether or not he was actually the father of the young girl. He had no way of finding them and walked daily in a place called The Field of the Lark because the name was also the only one he had for the girl.
	The raid upon the Gorbeau house failed to net the bandit Montparnasse, Eponine, and Monsieur Leblanc. Although Eponine was later picked up, on the trip from the house to the prison the bandit Claquesous escaped. The bandit Brujon was put in solitary confinement but managed to get a note to his comrade Babet concerning a possible robbery at a house in the Rue Plumet. Babet managed to get a note to Eponine whom, when she and her sister were released, scouted the location and sent back a biscuit which in the code of the prisons meant nothing to do. As such, the planned crime was not pursued.
	Meanwhile, Father Mabeuf had become increasingly more destitute and he had been forced to pawn all the plates for his book. One evening he tried to draw water from his well for his garden but found that he lacked the strength. Dejected and despairing he looked at the stars for pity and was surprised when a young girl jumped over his hedge and offered to water his garden. She drew three buckets of water and completed the task with ease. Father Mabeuf apologized that he was too poor to offer her any money but she asked only that he tell her where to find Marius. Somewhat confused but willing, Father Mabeuf told her to look in the Field of the Lark during the afternoon. She left as suddenly as she came.
	A few days later Eponine finds Marius daydreaming in the Field of the Lark. Marius is oblivious to her thinly veiled romantic feelings for him. She tells him that she can take him to the house where the young lady resides and he becomes very excited and happy. He makes her promise never to tell her father the address. When Eponine reminds him that he has promised to give her anything she wants if she provides him with the information, he gives her a five-franc piece which she sadly drops to the ground. She says, ""I don't want your money.""
	Analysis
	Marius was very upset when he realized that Thenardier, the man who had helped his father, was a crook. To avoid having to testify against him, he moves away and takes lodgings with Courfeyrac. Out of respect to his father, he sends money anonymously to Thenardier who has been imprisoned.
	Marius continues to try to find out the name of the mysterious girl of the park and refers to her as ""the lark."" He discovers a park called the Field of the Lark and spends time there as a means of consoling himself. He is so immersed with his own thoughts that he does not even realize that Eponine is interested in him and is trying to please him by even helping him find the girl.

Section 4 - Saint-Denis and Idyll of the Rue Plumet
	Book Three - The House on the Rue Plumet
	The house to which Eponine takes Marius was originally built in the 18th century as a secret home for the President of the Parliament of Paris' mistress. Situated on the Rue Plumet, the house was fronted by a concealing garden and an ironwork gate. The house was two stories with a small two-roomed outbuilding in the rear where a narrow winding passage was accessible through a masked door. The passage was flanked by high walls and artfully concealed by the landscape. Its terminus was a door nearly a third of a mile away. Jean Valjean had rented the house under the name Fauchelevent in 1829 when he had resolved to remove Cosette from the convent so that she could experience the outside world. He had hired two other residences as well but it was the house on the Rue Plumet that was their main home and it was there that they kept an old serving woman named Toussaint. Cosette and Toussaint lived in the house and kept it brightly furnished and Jean Valjean abided in the low out building which he kept austerely furnished. He had joined the National Guard during the large enrollments of 1831 and a few times a year he drilled with his company. He was happy for the extra veil of legitimacy that the Guard added to his concealment. The garden in the front of the house had grown unchecked for more than half a century and had become a place of mysterious beauty. When Cosette discovered that she had become very pretty she began wearing fine clothes and, much to Jean Valjean's despair, walking in the garden. For his part, Jean Valjean was horrified that Cosette had become beautiful, seemingly overnight, and he feared that he would lose her love. Her nice clothes made him anxious and he never walked in the garden but chose to remain in the concealed backyard.
	It was shortly after Cosette had begun to wear fine clothes and consider herself beautiful that Marius saw her for the second time at the Luxembourg and fell in love with her and, unknowingly, produced the same emotion in Cosette. She was baffled by the emotion and found that it made her a little sad but she could not resist her feelings and sought to conceal them from her father. Jean Valjean noticed Marius' attentions, however, and soon came to cordially detest the young man whom he feared might steal Cosette's love from him. He did not suspect, however, that Cosette had even noticed the young man. Soon after he discovered that Marius had been inquiring at their temporary residence he relocated to the house on the Rue Plumet. He noticed that Cosette became more silent and gloomy but could not discern the cause. Several months later he offered to take her to the Luxembourg which briefly made her happy but as Marius had discontinued his visits Cosette elected not to return and she became sad and quiet again.
	In the midst of these changes Jean Valjean received an unexpected shock. One morning while he and Cosette were watching the sunrise from a meadow on the outskirts of the city, seven carts full of miserable convicts being beaten by their guards came down the lane. A crowd gathered to watch and jeer the procession. Jean Valjean was terrified at the sight and recollected that he had traveled the same road on his way to the galleys. Cosette was equally horrified at the savage sight and asked her father if the convicts were still men to which he replied ""Sometimes."" That evening he overheard her tell Toussaint that if she should ever meet one of those men she would die just from his proximity to her. Time passes but the vision of the galley slaves does not leave Cosette's mind.
	Analysis
	The home where Valjean and Cosette live is very serene and picturesque, however Cosette is not happy. Her relationship with Valjean has become strained and she yearns for friends. She also misses the attention she was getting from Marius in the park.

	Though Jean Valjean and Cosette's life grows more somber they find distraction in their regular goodwill missions to take bread to the hungry and clothes to the cold. The day after the visit to the Jondrette's apartment Cosette notices a large burn wound on her father's arm but he makes light of it. The wound brings on a fever that confines him to his room for more than a month but he refuses to call a doctor. Cosette nurses him and eventually he recovers.
	One evening about this time hungry little Gavroche, the singing gamin, conceives of a plan to steal an apple from Father Mabeuf's garden. Before he could leap the hedge, however, he overhears a conversation between Mabeuf's serving woman, Mother Plutarch and her employer. She tells him that they have no money and no food and Father Mabeuf admits that he has no idea what to do. She leaves and Father Mabeuf sits and sorrowfully ponders his predicament. Gavroche climbs under the hedge and without being seen sits near Father Mabeuf and waits.
	Some time passes and Gavroche spots two figures coming down the lane. The first looked like an old bourgeois walking with a slow paced step. The second has the bearing of a dandy and Gavroche recognizes his acquaintance the robber Montparnasse. The robber attacks the old man but is soon brought to the ground by the man's superior strength. The old man, who is Jean Valjean, questions the younger but receives only sarcastic responses. He lectures the younger man on the perilous future that awaits him if he continues to pursue a life of crime. At the end of the lecture Valjean gives Montparnasse his purse and walks down the lane. While Montparnasse watches him, betraying no pity, Gavroche steals the purse and throws it over the hedge where it awakens Father Mabeuf.

	In early April, Jean Valjean goes away on one of his unexplained journey's that he would make when he needed money. These journeys would keep him away from home for a few nights.

When Jean Valjean returns she tells him of her experiences and he becomes anxious.

	One cold day that April, Gavroche is hungrily eyeing a cake of soap that he intends to steal from a barber's shop. He knows he can get good money for the soap and use it to purchase food. Two boys, one of about five years of age and the other about seven years old, enter the shop to beg for food and the barber angrily kicks them out. Gavroche takes pity on them and tells them to come with him. He leads them through the streets to a baker's shop where he produces a single sou piece, uses it to buy some bread and shares it with the boys. He leads them through the streets and they encounter Montparnasse whom Gavroche knows well. Montparnasse tells Gavroche that the robber Babet has escaped from prison and that they expect a scuffle with the police that night. He shows Gavroche the device he uses for changing the shape of his nose in order to disguise himself. Gavroche tells him that he is living in the elephant, which at first startles Montparnasse until he understands that Gavroche must mean the old statue of the elephant in the park near the Bastille. Gavroche explains that there is a hole between the two forelegs and that he can be found there if needed. They part ways and the two small boys follow Gavroche to the elephant where they are initially frightened to ascend the ladder into the beast's belly. Gavroche prods them, however, and soon all three boys are ensconced safe and warm in the elephant's interior. By candlelight Gavroche shows them to the elephant's belly where his bed is encased by mesh of wire netting stolen from the zoo. Once they are all nestled snuggly in the wool blanket, Gavroche blows out the candle and hundreds of rats descend upon the netting. The youngest boy is frightened but Gavroche assures him that the netting will protect him and holds his hand. Outside a storm rages, but soon all of them are fast asleep.
	In the hour before dawn Montparnasse comes calling and Gavroche joins him on the ground, leaving the two children sleeping inside the elephant. Montparnasse tells Gavroche that his assistance is needed and Gavroche follows without question. That night the robbers Brujon and Gueulemer had used the cover of the thunderstorm to effect an escape from their cell onto the roof of the prison. Using a handmade rope and some scaffolding left by workmen they had gradually worked their way to the ground where Montparnasse and Babet met them. Thenardier, who was in solitary confinement in the garret, had seen them on the roof. Though he was under observation and had weights attached to his legs he resolved to escape as well. Using a previously procured bottle of drugged wine he sedated the inexperienced guard, broke his chains and made his way onto the slippery roof where he found the broken rope left from Brujon and Gueulemer's escape. The rope is too short to lower him safely the three stories to the street and he is stuck atop a wall only ten inches wide. At four in the morning he hears sounds which tell him that his escape has been discovered. He is tormented by the thought: ""Dead if I fall, taken if I stay."" Four men gather below him and from their speech he determines that it is his comrades. They are about to give up hope for his escape and depart but he throws the broken rope at their feet and they see him stuck on the wall. Thenardier communicates that he is unable to lower himself because his hands have become numb but they are unable to climb three stories to rescue him. They see a flue that might be scaled in order to rescue Thenardier but it is too small to admit their bodies. At this juncture Montparnasse fetches Gavroche who agrees to climb the flue with the rope. As he is about to ascend, the first light of day illuminates Thenardier and Gavroche recognizes his father. Nevertheless, he performs his task and shortly Thenardier is safely on the street. As soon as he is safe Thenardier begins to speak of new crimes the group can commit and they discuss looking into the house on the Rue Plumet despite Eponine's negative report. None of them notice Gavroche who, sees that he is no longer needed and slips away.

	Book Eight - Enchantments and Desolations
	Throughout May of 1832 Marius comes to visit Cosette in the garden. Though they never repeat the kiss and neither conceives of anything but a chaste love, their meetings solidify their intense feelings for one another. They exchange many tender remarks and laugh often. Toussaint and Jean Valjean suspect nothing. On the second of June Marius encounters Eponine in the street and he is at first cold to her. She begins to ask a question but then breaks off the conversation and suddenly leaves.
	The next day she follows him and watches him enter the garden. She sits on a stone nearby to watch for him to exit. While she waits she sees her father and the gang of robbers approach the gate. She quickly steps in front of them and tries to persuade them not to enter the house. Her father shows her no affection and insists that the robbers will try their luck. She blocks their way and threatens to scream if they attempt to pass. In a dry, coughing voice she declares that she doesn't care whether she dies that night by the hand of her own father or a year later in a ditch from the cold. The men hold counsel and decide that she is in earnest. They leave to spend the night hiding in the sewer to which Thenardier has a key. Eponine secretly follows them to make sure they do not return.
	Meanwhile Cosette has tearfully told Marius that her father has told her that because of his business she should be ready to leave Paris and move to England within the week. Marius indicates to her that if she leaves he will die. She suggests that he travels to England as well but he explains that his poverty prevents it. He forms a desperate plan and tells Cosette not to expect him the following night but the next. She assents and he scratches his address on the wall in case something happens she might send word.
	The next evening Marius visits his grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand, who was then ninety-one years old and whose health has begun to fail. Though he outwardly maintains his displeasure with his grandson, inwardly he realizes that he dearly loves Marius and despairs that he might never see him again. The surprised old man receives Marius alone in his study and asks if his grandson has come to ask his pardon. Marius understands that he is being asked to denounce his father and he answers in the negative. The old man demands to know what Marius wants and the latter asks for pity. This causes the older man to rise from his chair and harangue the younger man. Marius promises to leave as soon as he has made his request. When Marius asks for permission to marry [because he is not twenty-five he must have his guardian's permission] the old man asks how he will support himself. When he learns that there is no dowry he refuses to give permission and Marius, in a fit of passion cries out ""Father!"" This word softens the old man a little and he draws Marius back into the room and asks for details. Marius tells him everything and when the old man learns where the object of his affections lives he says that he knows of the girl because Marius' cousin Theodule has claimed to have courted the same girl. He makes light of Marius' love and offers him money to show the girl a good time. He suggests that marrying her would be a mistake. Marius is shocked but the old man does not perceive this and says bluntly: ""Make her your mistress."" Deeply offended Marius declares that he shall never return and storms out of the room. Grief stricken, the old man calls for help and pleads for Marius' return but his grandson is already far away.
	Analysis
	Eponine self-sacrificing behavior is amazing considering her upbringing in an indifferent and selfish environment. She helps Marius find Cosette even though she is in love with him and protects Valjean's house when she stops Thenardier from breaking into the house.
	It is unfortunate that Marius' grandfather is incapable of showing his true emotions to his grandson and that he misconstrues Marius' intentions towards Cosette. By maintaining an upper-class attitude towards the poorer lower-class and suggesting that Marius should take Cosette as his mistress and not as his wife, he alienates his grandson even further and the rift between the two becomes even wider.

	Book Nine - Where Are They Going?
	On the afternoon of June 5th, 1832, Jean Valjean was sitting in a remote spot on the Champ de Mars pondering all the things that were making him anxious. He had seen Thenardier prowling about the neighborhood, Paris was in political turmoil, and the police were becoming more secretive and more active. He had recently discovered an address carved into the wall of the house. All these things had firmed his resolve to relocate to England if he could find some means of procuring a passport. In the midst of these thoughts a message fell into his lap that read simply ""Remove."" He turned and was just in time to see a small figure jump into the ditch and flee. He returned home full of thought.
	Marius' departure leaves his grandfather in despair. He does not give any heed to his grandfather's remarks about his cousin but is absorbed by the thought that Cosette will leave. He walks the streets until 2am and then falls asleep at Courfeyrac's, fully dressed. When he awakes Courfeyrac, Enjolras and other members of the ABC society are there. They ask him if he is going to the funeral of General Lamarque, an event bearing political importance but meaning nothing to Marius. When he leaves the apartment later in the day he takes the two pistols given him by Javert without knowing exactly why. He spends the day rambling in the streets biding his time until 9pm when he can see Cosette.
	Throughout the course of the day he hears strange sounds that seem to indicate fighting somewhere in the city. At 9pm he arrives as the garden but finds the house shut up and the occupants gone. In the midst of his despair he hears a voice that sounds like Eponine calling to him. The voice tells him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie.
	Meanwhile, Father Mabeuf, who in his innocence turned the purse into the police, has finally run out of money and things to sell. Despair takes hold of him. On the very day that Marius was waiting to meet Cosette, Father Mabeuf heard the sound of gunfire in the city and a passing gardener tells him that the fighting is concentrated near the arsenal. He takes his hat and goes out with a bewildered air.
	Analysis
	The author is setting the stage for the climax. The political situation is worsening in France and an uprising appears to be imminent. Problems of insurmountable proportions are brewing for many of the main characters. Marius' attempt to reconnect with his grandfather has failed; his visit to Cosette is futile because she has left with Valjean; Valjean feels that he is being watched and fears for his life and Cosette's safety; Father Mabeuf has no more money because he has brought the wallet that he found in his garden to the police and sold all of his books; Cosette is miserable because she knows that she will not be able to see Marius and does not want to leave France; Eponine is unhappy because she cannot gain Marius' affections; Monsieur Gillenormand realizes that he has lost his grandson because of what he said to him about Cosette.

	Book Twelve - Corinth
	The morning of July 5th, Bossuet (a.k.a. Laigle) and Joly had gone to the wine shop called Corinth for their breakfast. While they feasted upon oysters, ham, and cheese Grantaire joins them but begins his day by drinking wine. A small child comes with a message for Laigle from Enjolras that asks them to join the ABC group at the funeral procession. Grantaire announces that he cares more for breakfast than for a hearse and they all decide to stay in the wine shop. By two o'clock the table is covered with empty wine bottles. Laigle is leaning out the second story window of the shop wetting his back in the rain when he sees Enjolras, Courfeyrac and the others marching down the street. He calls to them to discover their purpose and learns that they are going to make a barricade. He suggests that they make one right there on the spot and Courfeyrac agrees that it is a good spot. In fact the streets converging on the Corinth formed the perfect location to construct a barricade. In short order the mob begins tearing up the paving stones, pulling iron bars from windows and stacking barrels until a wall the height of a man had been constructed. The residents of the street shut up their houses in horror and one old woman affixes a mattress to her window to stop the bullets. Bossuet liberates a passing carriage and adds it to the wall.
	Throughout all this destruction, the owner of the Corinth, the widow Huchelop, was beside herself with anxiety at the commandeering of her shop. Grantaire, for his part, continued to drink heavily and full of heady joy began to make inebriated announcements to the insurgents. Enjolras rebuked him for his disrespect and Grantaire immediately becomes somber and passes out at the table with his head in his hands.
	As the barricade and a smaller wall were being constructed the men, almost all bearing some specie of weapon, talked of their chances and resolved to die to the last if need be. They felt they could count on Paris to rise in support of their cause. In the kitchen of the Corinth all the pewter ware was being melted into bullets. In the midst of this activity Courfeyrac noticed that the young workingman who had come with a message for Marius had disappeared. Gavroche was a flurry of activity and words and directed the construction of the barricade with great enthusiasm. He had discovered that his ancient pistol lacked a hammer but much to his chagrin no one would give him a musket. When the two walls of the barricade were finished, with a small hole left at the extreme end to allow men to pass out, a red flag was raised above the larger wall. Courfeyrac produced the large box from his apartment and it proves to contain cartridges. Each man receives thirty.
	While the men wait for the soldiers to come they talk and sing songs. Night falls and the city is filled with sounds of intermittent gunfire. There are fifty men at the barricade and they expect the government to be massing sixty thousand troops. Gavroche finds a musket and while he is admiring it in the busy basement of the Corinth he notices a tall strange man come into the room and sit in deep meditation. At this moment Enjolras enters and asks Gavroche to go beyond the barricade and see what is going on in the streets. Gavroche agrees and then in a softer voice points out the strange man and warns Enjolras that he knows the man to be a police officer and most likely a spy. Enjolras gathers some strong men and asks the stranger who he is. The stranger disdainfully answers that he is an officer of the government and that his name is Javert. The strong men seize him and upon searching him find an identity card and a note that contains orders for him to examine the slope of the right bank of the Seine to see if robbers have resorts there once his political mission is fulfilled. They tie Javert to a post in the center of the room and inform him that he will be killed ten minutes before the barricade is taken. Javert contemptuously asks why they do not kill him immediately to which Enjolras observes that they are judges, not assassins. One of the members of the mob, a stranger to most but known as Le Cabuc, gets drunk and calls upon his fellow men to stave in the door of a nearby house so they can use the windows as a post from which they can fire. He begins to bang on the door with the butt of his musket and an old man, the porter, comes to the third story window and very politely refuses to open to the mob. Le Cabuc shoots the man in the head and his body slumps forward and hangs out the window. Enjolras seizes Le Cabuc and orders him to his knees. He gives Le Cabuc one minute to pray or think and at the end of one minute shoots him dead. The body is thrown over the barricade. Enjolras explains that he executed the man out of necessity for discipline and that they must be virtuous if their goals are to be taken seriously. He promises that he is committed to the death and the others pledge their fidelity. Soon afterward Courfeyrac notices that the slight young man that came calling for Marius has returned to the barricade.
	Analysis
	The construction of the barricade is described in detail as well as the barbaric behavior of the men who are involved in this endeavor. Enjolras attempts to establish some form of discipline but he also comes across as a brutal killer.

Before he makes himself knows to his friends he pauses to sit on the curb and ponder the life of his father, the soldier who spilled his blood for France on battlefields across the continent. Marius considers that this same blood flows in his own veins and then ponders the dignity of the civil war into which he is about to throw his life. After some consideration he comes to the conclusion that any war fought in the name of justice and freedom did honor to his father. He also comes to the conclusion that since Cosette knew he would kill himself if she left and she sent no message she must have stopped loving him.

	Before Marius can make himself known to his friends, however, the sound of Gavroche's singing comes from down the street and soon they see him running to join them. He tells them that the soldiers are coming and the whole barricade makes ready. They hear the sound of men approaching in the dark and a voice calls out ""Who goes there?"" to which Enjolras replies ""The French Revolution"" and a great eruption of gunfire answers back. The bullets are so thick that the staff supporting the red flag is cut and many of the bullets ricochet off the wall and wound some of the men inside the barricade. Courfeyrac orders the revolutionaries to conserve their ammunition and not fire until the soldiers are in the street and in sight. Enjolras asks who will return the flag to the top of the barricade but the men, somewhat humbled by the force of the musket fire, are silent. Enjolras pleads for a brave man to replace the flag and Father Mabeuf, who has sat in the cellar seeming to talk to himself and unresponsive to the other's pleas to seek safety, takes the flag and mounts the barricade. When he reaches the crest his shouts ""Viva la republique"" and is immediately cut down by a fierce burst of gunfire.
	Enjolras kisses the dead man on the forehead and removes his bloody coat pierced by numerous bullet holes. He announces that the coat will be their new flag. Father Mabeuf's body is carried reverently to the cellar and placed on a table. The soldiers make a rush on the barricade and close fighting results. Courfeyrac has fallen under a soldier's blows and is calling for help while Gavroche is about to be stabbed by a soldier's bayonet when shots kill both of their assailants.
	Marius steps into the fray having discharged two shots from his pistols. The soldiers are at the top of the barricade and the revolutionaries are at the point of being overwhelmed. Marius sees a keg of powder inside the basement door and as he turns toward it he notices a musket aimed at him. Before it fires, however, the young workingman who had come to Courfeyrac's with the message places his hand over the end of the musket and the bullet passes through his hand and he falls. Marius sees this but in the pell-mell of battle he continues toward the keg of powder. The revolutionaries and the soldiers fire simultaneously at extremely close range and everything disappears in a cloud of smoke. As both sides are reloading Marius calls out for the soldiers to retire or he will blow up the barricade. They notice him standing over the broken powder barrel with a flaming torch in his hand. He repeats his threat to destroy the soldiers and himself as well and the soldiers fall back. Marius is the hero of the moment and Enjolras appoints him the group's chief. A roll is taken and they determine that one of their dearest comrades, Jean Prouvaire, has been taken prisoner and they form a plan to trade Javert for their friend. At that moment, however, they hear the soldier's execute their friend and Enjolras tells Javert that he is doomed.
	Meanwhile, Marius is scouting the side streets when he hears a feeble voice that he recognizes call to him. He finds the young workman who stopped the bullet meant for him and discovers that this person is in fact Eponine. The musket ball has passed through her body and she is dying. She asks Marius to sit beside her. She lays her head in his lap and is comforted. She says that she knows that they will all die but she is glad to be dying before him. They hear the sound of Gavroche singing and she explains that the little boy is her brother and Marius thinks of the debt he owes to the Thenardiers. Eponine begins to fade and she gives Marius a letter she was supposed to have delivered earlier but that she kept for selfish reasons. She makes him promise to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead and then admits that she was a little in love with him. She dies and he kisses her on the forehead. He goes to the cellar and reads the letter. It is from Cosette who tells him that her father has removed them to new address and that in a week she leaves for London. Marius realizes that he must inform Cosette of his love and the manner of his death and also do his best to save Gavroche. He writer a letter that explains his failed plans to marry her and assures her of his love. On another sheet of paper he writes his name and directs the reader to carry his corpse to his grandfather's address. This paper he puts in his pocket. He takes the letter to Gavroche and orders him to sneak out and carry it beyond the barricade and in the morning to deliver it to the address. Gavroche is reluctant to leave but Marius insists. As Gavroche runs off he thinks to himself that the address is not far and that if he alters Marius' orders a little and delivers the letter immediately he can return before the action at the barricade resumes.
	Analysis
	The insurrection at the barricade is portrayed in vivid detail. Hugo describes a few heroic acts such as the replacing of the flag by Mabeuf and Eponine stepping in front of the bullet that was intended for Marius and thus saving his life. All along Hugo does that glorify the scene at the barricade and does not condone the killings that occur there.

	The book begins by relating the details of Jean Valjean, Cosette and Toussaint's removal from the house on the Rue Plumet. For the first time Jean Valjean and Cosette were at odds and they maintained a stony silence born of Valjean's anxiety and Cosette's sadness. She had succeeded in giving her note to what she believed was a young workingman who was lingering outside the gate. Nevertheless, she feared she would never see Marius again. Jean Valjean had allowed the women only to bring a few essentials. Cosette had brought her writing utensils and her writing blotter and Valjean had brought only the little trunk in which he kept the clothes he had first given to Cosette at the Thenardiers. Soon after they arrived at the stark lodging on the rarely traveled Rue de l'Homme Arme, Cosette retired to her bed with claims of a headache. Jean Valjean felt his anxiety fade and began to pace the room while pondering the best way to make possible their removal to England. He was so absorbed that he barely noticed when Toussaint told him that there is fighting in the city. He was happy because all he required for his happiness was Cosette.
	While pacing his gaze happened to fall upon Cosette's writing blotter reflected in the mirror and he sees Cosette's message to Marius. He is stunned and sinks into a chair. It seems to him that all the light has gone out of the world because it is obvious that Cosette has affections for another than himself. He feels betrayed. He knows immediately, without knowing his name, that the object of Cosette's affection is the young man from the Luxembourg. He feels hatred for this young man swell within him. He goes out to sit on the curb and listen to the sounds of the city.
	Gavroche approaches looking for the correct address to deliver the letter from Marius. Gavroche notices that the lights in the street are still working and throws a stone to break one. Jean Valjean asks what is the matter and Gavroche tells him that he is hungry. Jean Valjean takes pity and gives the boy a five-franc piece, an amount Gavroche has never seen. The boy refuses the coin, however, and insists that he would rather break lamps than have the money. Jean Valjean insists that he may take the money and continue to break lamps and Gavroche happily accepts. Gavroche informs him of the address he seeks and Jean Valjean gleans that he must have a letter from Marius to Cosette. Jean Valjean pretends to be expecting the letter and Gavroche turns it over to him. Through subtle questioning, Jean Valjean learns the location of the barricade where Marius is fighting. Gavroche leaves and Jean Valjean goes upstairs to read the letter. After perusing its contents he realizes that Marius will be dead by morning but the knowledge gives him no comfort. Soon afterward he leaves the apartment dressed in his National Guard uniform and bearing a musket.
	On his way back to the barricade, Gavroche steals a handcart from a drunken porter. His lamp carousing has not gone unnoticed in the otherwise peaceful quarter of the city and the local guard post hears the sound of his cart approaching. An officer stops him and demands to know where he is going but receives only sarcastic rebukes. Finally Gavroche shoves the cart into the officer's stomach which causes the man's gun to discharge. The whole barracks comes out in defense of their commander and begins firing at random but Gavroche has long since fled. He realizes that he is wasting time and resolves to head straight back to the barricade with no further distractions. The event becomes immortalized in the Quarter as the ""Nocturnal attack on the post of the Imprimerie Royale.""
	Analysis
	Both Marius and Valjean go to the barricade out of despair. They both feel that they have lost Cosette and that death is their only form of consolation. Gavroche is motivated to go to the barricade because he wants excitement and adventure. None of these men appears to be motivated to fight for a particular cause.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book One - War Between Four Walls
	The author begins this section with a description of the two great barricades that grew out of the uprisings of 1848. He then winnows back to the action of the novel (1832) and observes that Enjolras makes use of the night to strengthen the barricades and tend to the wounded. Four national guardsmen are found among the dead and Enjolras has their uniforms laid aside. The revolutionaries are out of food and Enjolras forbids them to drink the wine and brandy. There are thirty-seven of them left. They still retain hope that the city of Paris will rise up against the government and that by sundown a revolution will have begun. Enjolras, however, tells the group that the whole army has been raised and that they have little to hope for. One of the revolutionaries proclaims his belief that they must fight to the death for the republic and all jubilantly agree. Enjolras insists that those who have wives and children must use the four captured guard's uniforms to escape before the next attack. No man wants to leave the barricade but Marius supports this assertion and eventually five men step forward. As there are only four uniforms the arguments begin anew as to who can stay and who must go. Marius is asked to choose which of the four men will be required to leave and at that moment a fifth uniform is thrown in with the others. Marius raises his eyes and sees the man he knows only as Monsieur Fauchelevent standing before him. The others are suspicious but Marius says that he knows the man and he is permitted to stay. Enjolras delivers a stirring speech to the group and asks them to imagine the happy future that their sacrifice will make possible.
	Afterward they move Javert to a table and in the process Javert recognizes Jean Valjean and states: ""It is very natural."" At dawn a ration of brandy is distributed to all the defenders. The soldiers wheel a small artillery piece into place and amid the defender's heckling discharge a shot. The cannonball only succeeds in damaging a bit of the barricade. Gavroche returns to the barricade and warns the men that they are surrounded. Marius accosts the gamin for returning to the danger. Gavroche feels vaguely guilty about not having delivered the letter directly to the addressee but tells Marius that the porter will deliver it shortly. Marius asks Gavroche if he knows the man who has joined them, Monsieur Fauchelevent, but Gavroche who only saw him in the darkness of night answers in the negative and Marius is satisfied. The soldiers renew their attack upon the barricade by firing a canister of grapeshot from their artillery piece. The grapeshot strikes the wall and ricochets causing the death of several revolutionaries. Enjolras shoots the handsome young commander of the artillery, a man that he and Combeferre agree could be their brother, which delays another shot for some minutes. The defenders of the barricade determine that they need a mattress to absorb the grapeshot and Jean Valjean, who has remained silent and not fired his weapon, asks to borrow Enjolras' double-barreled carbine. He shoots the ropes that hold the mattress hung by the old woman above her garret window and it falls into the street between the soldiers and the revolutionaries. Under heavy fire Jean Valjean goes into the street and returns with the mattress which is strategically placed against the wall where it succeeds in absorbing the grapeshot.
	Meanwhile, Cosette wakes up from a dream in which Marius was coming to her surrounded by a halo. It is very early in the morning and she believes that her father is still asleep. She opens the shutters hoping to catch a glimpse of Marius coming to her but she can see only gardens. She hears a distant jarring sound that she believes comes from people shutting porte-cocheres at an unaccountably early hour. The sound is in fact the artillery piece hammering the barricade.
	At the barricade, the defenders hold their fire to preserve their ammunition. The soldiers continue to pound the barricade with canon fire but it has little effect. The defenders notice that the soldiers have placed an observer with a casque on a nearby roof. Jean Valjean dispatches him and an officer who follows him by shooting their casques. When Bousset asks why he did not kill the men Jean Valjean remains silent. Soon the soldiers bring up another more powerful artillery gun that begins to dislodge pieces of the barricade. Enjolras gives the order to fire upon the artillerymen and nearly two-thirds of them fall. Though the pace of the guns is slackened, they continue to be serviced and Enjolras observes that the insurgents will soon be out of ammunition. Gavroche overhears this comment and goes into the street and begins to fill a basket with the cartridge boxes from the slain soldiers. Soon the soldiers begin to fire upon him. Gavroche stands up, begins to sing at the top of his voice and continues to gather the cartridge boxes. Shots fall all around him but Gavroche continues to sing and gather cartridges until, finally, a shot strikes him in the face. He falls, rises to his feet and again bursts into a song but it is cut short when a second bullet finds his body and kills him.
	Meanwhile in the garden of the Luxembourg the two children whom Gavroche had sheltered in the elephant (and who are really his brothers) were looking for something to eat. They had crept into the gated garden and the overseer, distracted by the fighting in the city, had not seen them. The Luxembourg was beautiful and washed by rain that morning. Near a large water basin used by the swans they perceived a man and his child carrying a large bread bun coming down the path. The man, who is a bourgeois, notices the two dirty children clothed in rags standing near the swan house but he has nothing but disdain for them. His son begins to cry because he is no longer hungry and the father commands him to throw his bun to the swans. Before the swans can eat the loaf, however, the sky darkens and the sound of cannon fire increases. The bourgeois leads his child away. The older homeless child fishes the soggy bun out of the water. Mimicking Gavroche, he gives a large portion to his brother and says ""Stick that in your gun.""
	Meanwhile, back at the barricade, Combeferre and Marius have retrieved the basket of cartridges. Marius receives a wound to his head from a musket ball that grazes it and Courfeyrac binds it with a caravan. Once the cartridges are distributed each man is left with fifteen shots. Jean Valjean refuses any cartridges. Enjolras notices that the soldiers are massing for an assault and he hurriedly directs the men to use paving stones to block up the windows of the Corinth but to leave room for muskets to fire out. Enjolras directs all the men as to how to comport themselves once the charge comes and orders the manner in which they will fall back into the shop and fight until the last man. He also gives orders that the last man to leave the basement is to take Javert behind the smaller wall next to the large barricade and execute him.
	At this point Jean Valjean enters and requests permission to kill Javert himself. Enjolras grants permission and Jean Valjean leads Javert to the place of execution. Nobody sees Jean Valjean cut the cords that bind Javert and tell him that he is free. Jean Valjean tells Javert that he doesn't expect to survive the barricade but he gives the address where Javert can find him in case he does. Javert goes a few steps then turns and asks Jean Valjean to shoot him but the latter refuses and once he is gone Jean Valjean discharges his pistol into the air. Meanwhile Marius, who saw Jean Valjean lead Javert to his execution, recollects where he knows Javert from and thinks to intervene but before he can stop the execution he hears the pistol shot and Jean Valjean states that the deed is done. The assault begins and the soldiers are like waves breaking against the cliff of the barricade. Marius fights exposed above the barricade and the dead bodies pile up around him. Ten assaults are made upon the barricade and the defenders begin to run out of ammunition. Marius is hacked by numerous wounds, particularly about his head, and Enjolras alone remains untouched.
	Finally the center of the barricade is breached and the insurgents fall back fighting to the wine shop. Enjolras keeps the soldiers at bay long enough for the surviving insurgents to enter the shop before he slips in and the defenders close and bar the door against the soldiers. Marius, however, has fallen from a shot that has broken his shoulder blade. He feels himself being caught by strong hands before he passes out. The soldiers begin to lay siege to the wine shop and a bloody battle ensues that concludes with all dead in the upstairs room except for Enjolras who is cornered. The soldiers recognize him as the leader and resolve to shoot him. Enjolras throws down the butt of the spent carbine he was using as a weapon and bears his chest to soldiers and commands them to shoot. Silence envelopes the room and the soldiers hesitate in the face of one who is so willing to die well. Twelve soldiers quietly prepare to execute him and before the officer gives the order to fire Grantaire, who has been passed out drunk from a mixture of absinthe-stout-alcohol since the previous day, awakes and perceives what is about to happen. He shouts ""Vive la Republique"" and crosses the room to join Enjolras. He asks the other man's permission to die with him and Enjolras responds by taking Grantaire's hand before the soldiers fire killing them both.
	During the attack Jean Valjean had caught Marius and carried him unseen to the same sheltered spot where Eponine had died. With perhaps only a few minutes before he would be discovered and certainly killed, he looked desperately about for a way to escape. His gaze rested upon an iron grating in the street that opened to a sort of flue below the surface. Using his old prison escape instincts, Jean Valjean freed the grating, put Marius over his shoulder, used his hands and knees to lower himself and replaced the grating in a matter of minutes. He found himself in a long underground passage with the fading sounds of battle above.
	Analysis
	Throughout the chapter, Valjean acts nobly and with valor. He shows forgiveness to those he hates even if it means risking his own life. He offers to be the one to execute Javert and secretly frees him instead. Even though he hates Marius for having taken Cosette's love away from him, he does not allow him to die and saves him by carrying him out of the barricade and escaping with him through the sewer.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Two - The Intestine of Leviathan
	The book begins with the observation that every year the city of Paris throws valuable fertilizer into the sea by way of its sewers. The author argues that it is a waste of money to let this resource go unutilized and observes that nothing is gained but pollution of the water and sickness. He notes that the Parisian sewer system is an imitation of the Roman sewer system and is similarly complex. He describes the layout from a bird's eye perspective. A historical sketch of the importance of sewers follows and includes the observation that ""the history of men is reflected in the history of cloacae."" Historically sewers have been used as shelters for the homeless and persecuted. The author characterizes the sewer as the ""conscience of the city"" because it is the place where all the city's secrets are gathered. The sewer tells the history of what humanity doesn't want.
	In the sixteenth century Henry II mounted an exploration of Paris' sewer which failed owing to the fact that the sewer had been left to itself since the Middle Ages and it had come to be a labyrinth. Unmanaged it occasionally flooded and did so famously in 1802. It became known as the Stink-Hole. No one dared to explore it until 1805 when a man named Bruneseau, who was characterized by his superior as the bravest man in Napoleon's empire, received permission to explore the sewer. He mounted a twenty-man expedition and they fought their way through subterranean caverns and passages overgrown by fungi, sinkholes and deadly vapors. Along the way they made maps and measured passages and openings. They discovered such things as ancient dates scratched into the rock, medieval dungeons and the skeleton of an orangutan that had escaped from the zoo five years prior.
	The sewer at the time of the story is much improved. Owing to the peculiar quality of the Parisian soil, however, there are still many parts of the sewer where sinkholes have developed as well as deposits of quick sand. Each government since Napoleon has worked to enlarge and maintain the sewer and many workers died from asphyxia and typhus. At the time of the story there were thirty miles of sewer beneath the city. The unhealthy air produced by so much polluted water is the taint of the city. The author reiterates his assertion that the cloacae should be used as fertilizer.
	Analysis
	In order to better understand the environment into which Valjean has gone in the hope of escaping the soldiers, the chapter is devoted to a description and a historical discussion of the intricate sewer system of Paris.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Three - Mire, But Soul
	Jean Valjean drops with Marius into the Paris sewer. He does not know if the young man is alive or dead and at first can see nothing. He feels that the passage is narrow and that the floor is solid but slippery. Eventually his eyes adjust to the feeble light from the grating. He perceives that behind him is the termination of the branch and in front absolute darkness. Fearful of discovery he plunges into the darkness. After fifty paces he comes to the end of that passage where it runs into a transverse passage. Jean Valjean understands that to follow the descent of the ground would take him to the river and he would emerge in full daylight and be captured. He chooses to take the ascending right fork. As he walks he feels Marius' blood running over him and he hears his feeble breath against his ear.
	The narrator observes that the section of sewer in which Jean Valjean was walking was confusing and presented numerous opportunities for misdirection. Jean Valjean notices that the water is now flowing in a direction that indicates he is moving downhill. He is confused but continues going forward. The narrator interjects that Jean Valjean was then walking toward the massive belt sewer. At every branch he chooses the larger opening, reasoning that smaller passages must terminate without an outlet. At one point during his groping travel he is surprised by an ominous red light behind him that reveals the shadowy outline of ten forms. These are police scouting the sewer for those who have fled the uprisings. Jean Valjean hugs the wall and the police hold a council and decide that they were wrong in believing they heard footsteps from the direction of the belt sewer. The police continue in a different direction but not before blindly discharging a shot down the corridor in which Jean Valjean stands. The shot grazes the stone above Valjean's head but causes him no harm.
	At that moment another policeman on the banks of the Seine near the Point de Invalids was ""spinning"" a thief, which is to say, he was following a known criminal with the object of snaring his comrades. This policeman, according to orders, had a coach following him on the road above to aid in the tracking process. The criminal eventually reaches a point on the river where he must either stop or dive into the river. He slips out of sight over a small hill of rubbish and the police officer rounds this pile with the belief that his prey is trapped only to find him inexplicably gone. A sewer grating is nearby but it proves to be firmly locked. He concludes that the man must have a key to the sewers. He posts himself outside the grating and waits to see what will transpire.
	Jean Valjean presses on through the sewer but his strength begins to wane. At about 3pm he arrives in the belt sewer and is surprised by the sudden enlargement of the space. The Grand Sewer is 8ft wide and 7ft high. He comes to a branching and decides that he must risk capture or expire in the sewer so he chooses to descend toward the river. At one of the branchings he notices there is a little more light and lays Marius down to inspect him. He eats the bread from his pocket and memorizes the address written upon the paper in Marius' pocket. He binds up his wounds as best he is able and then looks upon the young man with absolute hatred. He picks up Marius and resumes his journey. At one point he realizes that the pavement is giving way beneath him and that he has entered a quicksand bog but he cannot go back and presses on hoping the liquid will not rise above his head. By degrees Jean Valjean, with Marius on his back, is submerged until he must throw his head back to get air.
	At the moment beyond which he will surely drown, his foot strikes a solid surface and he begins to ascend from the mire. Exhausted but resolute he presses on. Soon he perceives the white light of day ahead and he makes the final effort to reach the opening. He finds the end of the passage blocked by a locked iron work gate. It is about half-past eight in the evening and the sky is getting dark. He lays Marius on the ground and tries to shake the bars loose to no avail. He drops to his knees in dejection and thinks of Cosette. At this moment he is surprised to hear someone say: ""Go halves."" Jean Valjean looks up to see Thenardier before him. Thenardier does not recognize Jean Valjean and believes that he is a robber who has killed the young man and dragged him into the sewer to go through his pockets. Thenardier shows Jean Valjean that he has the key to the gate and approves of the supposed assassin wanting to use the Seine to drown the corpse.
	Throughout his questioning Jean Valjean remains more or less silent. Thenardier demands to see the money and searches both Jean Valjean and Marius but finds nothing more than thirty francs. In the process of searching Marius he tears, unnoticed by Jean Valjean, a bit of cloth from Marius' coat so as to be able to identify the corpse and assassin at a later date. Thenardier takes the whole thirty francs and opens the grate before disappearing into the sewer. Jean Valjean exits the sewer only to find Javert waiting for him. He tells Javert that he will submit to arrest if Javert will allow him to take the young man to the home of his grandfather. Javert recognizes Marius from the barricade. Though Jean Valjean insists that he is alive, Javert believes him to be dead. He calls for the coach and they set off toward Monsieur Gillenormand's house. When they arrive at the house everyone is asleep. Javert calls the porter who calls Aunt Gillenormand who receives Marius. Nobody wakes the grandfather. While the Aunt calls for the doctor Javert and Jean Valjean slip outside. Inside the carriage Jean Valjean asks for permission to stop by his house and Javert orders the driver to that address. Jean Valjean's intention is to see Cosette one last time and tell her Marius' whereabouts and condition. At the entrance to Jean Valjean's street, Javert dismisses the carriage and the driver exacts a fine for the bloodstains on the interior. Javert pays out of his own pocket. He leads Jean Valjean to his door and orders him to go up. Jean Valjean goes up the stairs and happens to look out the window and sees, to his surprise, that Javert is gone.
	At the Gillenormand's, the doctor examines Marius and determines that while he is still alive he has several serious wounds that will take much time and luck to heal. Chief among these is the dislocated broken shoulder blade and numerous cuts to the head. The grandfather enters the room and believing Marius to be dead begins to recant his treatment of his grandson. He declares that he had gone past holding a grudge and that Marius has gotten himself killed out of revenge. He calls to mind Marius' childhood and bemoans the death of his only beloved grandson. The physician, afraid that the old man will feint and perish, says nothing. At this moment Marius opens his unfocused eyes and the grandfather, perceiving that he is alive, falls on his knees and begs him to recover.
	Analysis
	Valjean's flight for safety within the sewer, carrying Marius on his back, is very difficult and dangerous. When he finally reaches a possible opening, he finds the grating to be locked and Thenardier on the other side. Thenardier does not recognize Valjean and thinks that he is a robber who has just killed his victim for money. After a brief bartering scene wherein Valjean offers him whatever money he has, he opens the grating and disappears. Valjean's safety is short lived as Javert suddenly arrives and arrests him. Valjean pleads to be permitted to bring Marius to his grandfather and also to go his own home before going with Javert and the latter agrees.
	It is quite surprising to see this change in Javert's behavior toward Valjean. The biggest surprise occurs when Valjean realizes that Javert has gone and Valjean is free. One can only surmise that Javert is paying back his debt to Valjean.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Four - Javert Off the Track
	After leaving Jean Valjean's door, Javert had walked slowly down the silent streets with his head down and his arms behind his back. He had never walked with his head down or his arms behind his back until that night. His whole person bore the mark of anxiety. He stopped at a police station and wrote a letter to his superior suggesting some improvements that could be made to the established police procedures.
	He then walked to a point of the Seine near the Point Note Dame where two bridges make the water wild and dangerous. Javert had only ever known one path in life and that was to do his duty. But since Jean Valjean had spared his life and he had returned the gesture by allowing the convict to remain free, his sense of duty had been trumped and he no longer knew by what principles to live his life. He had been astonished that Jean Valjean had spared him but he was petrified that he, Javert, had in turn spared Jean Valjean. He felt that the right thing to do was to have Jean Valjean arrested but something inside him prevented him from taking the action. But by not taking action Javert realized he was setting himself above the law. He had never aspired to be humane, great or sublime, but merely to be irreproachable and he has failed even in that. He felt he no longer had reason to exist. After a few moments of consideration he mounted the parapet and cast himself into the water.
	Analysis
	Javert has come to a turning point in his life. He has always followed the law and knew exactly what to do and what was considered to be right and wrong. By allowing Valjean to walk away as a free man, he has done something contrary to the law and is no longer able to function and live. The only left for him to do is to commit suicide.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Five - Grandson and Grandfather
	One of the men captured in the raid on the Jondrette house was Siuer Boulatruelle who, since he was passed out drunk, was freed since the police could not determine whether he was a robber or a victim. He returned to the woods surrounding Montfermeil to repair the roads and drink wine. He remained convinced that there was buried treasure in the woods. One day very early in the morning, soon after the events related in the preceding book, he saw the back of a figure entering the woods. He believes he recognizes the figure and resolves to follow him. The path becomes difficult to follow and Boulatruelle climbs a tree for a better view. He sees the figure glide into a distant glade that Boulatruelle knows contains a great heap of stones and a wounded chestnut tree bandaged by a zinc plate. Boulatruelle is overjoyed to think he has discovered the treasure's hiding place but he has a great deal of trouble making his way through the thickets to reach the spot. Forty minutes later Boulatruelle arrives at the spot and is embittered to find a fresh hole in front of the tree with an abandoned pick lying nearby. The hole is empty. Boulatruelle shakes his fist at the sky and cries ""Robber!""
	Marius lies hovering between life and death for many weeks. His grandfather sits beside him though the ordeal and many nights Marius repeats the name ""Cosette"" in his delirium. Everyday a white haired man drops off a package of lint for Marius' dressings. Four months after the battle of the barricade the physician pronounces Marius out of danger. Fortunately, the state has forgotten about him and he does not face charges or arrest. As Marius' health improves his grandfather became more lighthearted and gay and even begins calling Marius ""Monsieur The Baron"" and was heard once to cry out in favor of the Republic. Since no one had noticed the man who brought Marius home and since Marius has no memory of leaving the barricade he is completely dumfounded as to how his salvation had been effected. He thought of nothing but Cosette and had a vague suspicion of his grandfather's improved mood and behavior. He believes that as soon as he broaches the subject of Cosette his grandfather will return to his old ways. He resolves to expose his wounds and injure himself if his grandfather refuses him Cosette.
	One afternoon he decides to press his case and states that he wishes to marry. Much to his surprise his grandfather readily consents, admits that he has learned a great deal about the lovely girl and that she comes everyday in the form of an old man bearing the lint bandages she makes. Marius and his grandfather are reunited in love and Marius demands to see Cosette that very day.
	Cosette arrives with Monsieur Fauchelevent who carries a slightly moldy looking package. The grandfather formally requests permission for Cosette to marry Marius and Monsieur Fauchelevent assents by slightly bowing his head. At that, Marius and Cosette fall into rapt conversation while gently holding hands. The grandfather is overjoyed and expresses his regret that when he dies they will not have any money because he only subsists on his pension. Monsieur Fauchelevent announces that Cosette has nearly six hundred thousand francs. Fauchelevent, who had remained silent and motionless, then opens the package and reveals it to be full of banknotes. All are astonished and happy.
	The wedding is planned for the month of February only two months later. Those months pass in delirious joy and Jean Valjean seeks to appease Cosette's happiness by trying to show as much joy as Cosette herself. He clears up the problem of her birth by establishing that she was the daughter of the real Fauchelevent and that he is her uncle. The confused nuns at the convent back up this story and Cosette's disappointment that the man she thought of as her father was really her uncle is lessened by the excitement of the approaching wedding. She continues to call Jean Valjean ""Father."" Monsieur Gillenormand showers Cosette with rich gifts from his home including many fine ladies dresses that were the height of fashion during his younger days and have since come back into vogue. Marius' Aunt Gillenormand is impressed by the six hundred thousand francs and decides to leave her own considerable fortune to the pair.
	Marius and Cosette decide that they will live in the Gillenormand house after they are married and the library will serve as Marius' law office. Cosette comes to visit with her father everyday. Marius is uncertain how to feel about Monsieur Fauchelevent whom he regards as a condition to his marrying Cosette. For his part, Monsieur Fauchelevent is austere and cold and resists any commentary on the subject of the barricade. Marius hires people to find Thenardier, whom he knows to be a scoundrel but also his father's savior at Waterloo. Thenardier's wife, however, has died in prison and his only remaining daughter, Azelma, has vanished with him. Marius question the driver of the coach that brought him home but only learns that he was carried out of a sewer opening by someone who was immediately arrested. He was brought to the house and that later the officer and his prisoner left the carriage. Marius can think of no man sufficiently devoted to him to have carried him through the sewer. He preserves the coat he had worn that night, which he notices to be oddly ripped, in hopes it might yield some clues. One night while discussing the mystery with Monsieur Fauchelevent, Marius grows passionate and exclaims that he would give all of Cosette's money to find that man. Jean Valjean remains silent.
	Analysis
	It is rewarding to see the reunion between Marius and his grandfather. Even though the old man has not changed his political views, his love for his grandson allows him to overcome that obstacle and help Marius in all of his endeavors. Even Valjean hides his sorrow of having lost Coseete's love to Marius and feigns happiness over the couple's forthcoming marriage and gives them a very sizeable present.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Six - The White Night
	A few days before the wedding Jean Valjean appears with a bandage on his right hand and claims that he has hurt his right thumb. He refuses medical treatment and Monsieur Gillenormand must sign for him on the legal papers. Marius and Cosette are married on February 16th, 1833. It is a rainy day but the two lovers hardly notice the weather. On the way to the church their carriage is held up by Mardis Gras traffic. It so happened that an older man dressed in a Spaniards costume and a young girl, who coughs and laughs in her velvet mask, pull up opposite the carriage in which Jean Valjean sits with Monsieur Fauchelevent, Marius and Cosette. The old man swears to the girl that he knows that man and orders her to discover who they are. When she protests that the task will be difficult he states that since he can't afford to be seen she, whom he calls Azelma, must try to do it for him.
	The wedding comes off well and the entire party returns to the Gillenormand home for the celebration. Jean Valjean remains aloof and when the party sits for dinner the servant tells them that Monsieur Fauchelevent has returned home on account of his sore hand but will come by in the morning. Fauchelevent's absence cools the party for a moment but the inertia of the day sweeps them along and soon everyone is gay again. Monsieur Gillenormand gives a romantic speech on the importance of love and later they dance a little and laugh a lot. Jean Valjean returns to his empty apartment and lights a candle. He uses his right hand as though nothing were the matter with it. From the small valise that he has carried for so many years he pulls all the clothes that he brought to Cosette when he rescued her from the Thenardier's. The sight of the clothes brings back a flood of happy memories of the time when she had nobody else in the world but him. He begins to sob.
	Jean Valjean spends the entire night wracked by his conscience. Though he knows that he has brought about Cosette's happiness he also knows that she no longer belongs to him. Like the night before the Champmathieu trial he is unable to make up his mind. He realizes that if he loses Cosette he is worse than back in prison, he is nothing. He also knows that he has no right to intrude upon her happiness and cannot now figure a way to limit his involvement so that it might not cause her harm if his identity is discovered.
	Analysis
	The marriage has no glitches and Cosette marries under the name of Fauchelevant, the name of an extinct family. By not signing the document, Valjean has ensured the legality of the procedure.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Seven - The Last Drop in the Chalice
	The day after the wedding Jean Valjean arrives at the Gillenormand house and has the servant call for Marius but tells him not to reveal his identity. Most of the house is still sleeping, on account of the previous evening's festivities. Marius greets him as ""Father"" and expresses that he and Cosette desire that Jean Valjean should come live with them. Without any preamble Jean Valjean informs Marius that he is a former convict, that he faked his thumb injury so his illegal signature would not be added to their license and that he is currently in breach of his ban. Marius is shocked and repulsed. He tells the young man that his real name is Jean Valjean and reassures the terrified young man that Cosette is not related to him. Marius asks why Jean Valjean has revealed himself and the former convict answers that it is from honor and conscience and so that he will not be a pretender in their household. Marius offers to have his grandfather try to arrange a pardon but Jean Valjean refuses on the grounds that the authorities believe him to be dead which is better than a pardon. The awkward moment is interrupted by Cosette's entrance. She assumes that the two men have been talking politics and becomes very cross when Marius insists she leave so they can continue their conversation in private. After she leaves Jean Valjean beseeches Marius not to tell Cosette the truth of his identity and Marius promises to keep his secret. Although Marius at first suggests that it would be best if Jean Valjean never saw Cosette again Jean Valjean humbly begs the right to see her in the evenings in the basement room of the house where he will not intrude into the house's day-to-day life. Marius assents, but after Jean Valjean has left, he regrets his decision.
	Analysis
	It is almost unbelievable that after all that has happened and with no one around to reveal his identity, Valjean feels the need to tell Marius about his past and who he really is. Even though he knows that it can only hurt his relationship with his new son-in-law, he feels he must tell him everything out of ""honor"". It is unfortunate that Marius lacks understanding and compassion and becomes revolted instead.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Eight - The Twilight Wane
	Jean Valjean calls the following evening and is shown to the dusty basement where two chairs have been placed near a cozy fire. Cosette arrives and orders her father to come upstairs and dine with them. He obstinately refuses and instructs Cosette, whom he calls ""Madame"" to call him ""Monsieur Jean."" Cosette is hurt and cannot understand what she has done to offend her father. Overcome by emotion, Jean Valjean hugs her and calls her ""Cosette"" but soon recants his moment of weakness and leaves. The next evening he comes to visit and receives Cosette in the same manner and she asks no more questions.
	The household adjusts to this new arrangement easily and dismisses it to the eccentricities of old Fauchelevent. Although Cosette persists in loving the man she knows as her father his attempts to separate from her are mostly successful and she becomes less outwardly affectionate over time. Jean Valjean notices the frugal manner in which Marius orders the household's economy and asks Cosette why they do no live more comfortably with their wealth. She answers that Marius had recently asked her if she would be content on the money from Monsieur Gillenormand and she answered that she would be happy so long as he remained her husband. Jean Valjean gleans that Marius is suspicious of the money he provided for Cosette's dowry. Jean Valjean also notices that the fire is no longer lit and that the chairs are occasionally misplaced and finally, one spring evening, entirely missing from the basement room. He takes the hint, says goodbye to Cosette and does not return the following evening. He sends word that business is keeping him away and Cosette, used to her father's occasional departures, thinks nothing of it. The shopkeepers on the street where Jean Valjean resides notice him start out every evening but then see him return to his apartment. Eventually his outings barely take him off his own street. He seems oblivious to the elements and the laughter of the children who heckle him.
	Analysis
	It is quite sad to see what has befallen on Valjean and the deterioration of his body and soul. One wonders how the twopeople who owe their lives to this man, allow this to occur and don't show compassion.

Section Five - Jean Valjean
	Book Nine - Supreme Shadow, Supreme Dawn
	Jean Valjean eventually stops leaving his apartment and then a whole day passes where he does not eat or leave his bed. His landlady becomes very worried and has a doctor come see her lodger. The doctor agrees that the man is very sick but suggests that since he seems like a man who has lost a dear friend there is little he can do. One evening Jean Valjean finds that he has great difficulty rising from his bed. Nevertheless he gets up and with much effort dresses himself and lays out Cosette's clothes. Perspiring from the effort he lights two candles in the silver candlesticks given to him by the bishop so many years before and begins to write a letter to Cosette in which he tries to explain the manner in which he made the money. Before he can finish he breaks down in tears at the thought that he is about to die without ever seeing Cosette again. There is a knock at the door.
	That same day Marius is in his office when the servant brings him a letter from a man waiting to see him. Marius recognizes the letter as one of Thenardier's ruses but is surprised when he does not recognize the man who enters. The man insists that he is a member of Society who has fallen on hard times and has some information to sell. Marius is curt but allows the man to continue. The man reveals that the person known as Monsieur Fauchelevent is actually the convict Jean Valjean. Marius surprises his guest by coolly answering that he is already aware of those facts. Moreover, Marius has seen through the man's disguise and after he gives him five hundred francs Thenardier reveals himself. Marius reveals that through inquiries he has learned some of Jean Valjean's history, namely that he robbed a man named Madeleine, and states that he knows him to be the murderer of the police officer Javert. Here Thenardier surprises him by using newspaper clippings to prove that Jean Valjean was Madeleine and that Javert committed suicide. Marius is overjoyed to discover that Jean Valjean was essentially a good man but Thenardier cautions that he can still prove the man to be a robber and murderer. Amid Marius' rising interest, Thenardier relates the story of encountering Jean Valjean in the sewer with a corpse that he desired to rob and describes the extreme effort the man must have exerted to bring the corpse that far. To prove his story, Thenardier shows Marius the piece of torn cloth from the murdered man's coat. Marius is jubilant at having discovered his savior's identity and accuses Thenardier of being a scoundrel. He tells the astonished man that he knows of his crimes and could have him put in jail for the rest of his life. He remembers his father's letter, however, and angrily gives Thenardier several thousand francs and orders him to leave the country and go to America at which time he will send him twenty thousand francs never to return. The narrator relates that two days later Thenardier and Azelma left for America where Thenardier eventually became a slave trader.
	Once Thenardier has left the house, Marius retrieves Cosette from the garden and in wild haste orders a carriage to take them to Jean Valjean's apartment. They enter the poor man's room just as his strength has failed and he is despairing of never seeing Cosette again. Cosette immediately embraces her father but Marius, overcome by emotion, leans in the doorway. Soon, however, he bursts forth with his knowledge of all that has passed and Jean Valjean feebly insists that he kept everything secret to avoid embarrassing the family. Marius insists that Jean Valjean will be living with them from then on and Jean Valjean counters that he will not be at their house nor his own the next day. They misunderstand his meaning and Cosette describes all the pleasant things he will experience at their house. Jean Valjean smiles at the sound of her voice and admits that he will die in a few moments. Cosette and Marius beg him to live. The physician enters and intimates to Marius that he and Cosette were what the old man needed but they are too late to save him. Jean Valjean explains where the money came from and begs Marius to use it to make Cosette happy. The landlady enters and asks if Jean Valjean wants a priest but he answers that he already has one. He means the long dead bishop and indicates a point in the air. He calls Marius and Cosette near and shares memories of the happy times that he and Cosette knew in the past and insists that his gravestone be simple and have no name. He tells Cosette that her mother's name was Fantine and that she suffered much so that Cosette could be happy. He dies.
	The narrator notes that in a secluded spot in the Pere-Lachaise cemetery there is a stone that bears no name. At some point there was once a verse written in pencil that has since faded but when legible read:
He is asleep. Though his mettle was sorely tried,
	He lived, and when he lost his angel, died.
	It happened calmly, on its own,
	The way night comes when day is done.
Analysis
	It is satisfying to realize that all the misunderstandings between Valjean and Cosette and Valjean and Marius are resolved and that his behavior is finally understood by the ones whose love he so desperately needs. He is now finally able to forgive himself and dies in peace.

377,Divine Comedy: Summary: Inferno section 1- Inferno section 5,"Inferno section 1: Dante's journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Heaven (Paradiso) takes place in 1300, at the midpoint of his life.  Dante sets himself as the narrator and main character of this epic poem.  His flight through Hell begins in a dark and unknown forest.  As Dante wanders through the woods he comes to a hill above which shines the first sunlight that he has encountered in the forest.  But as Dante begins to climb the hill a leopard blocks his path.  As Dante retreats, a lion and a she-wolf join the leopard in driving Dante back into the dark valley.  Rushing terrified down the hill Dante encounters a shadowy figure.  The figure reveals itself to be the spirit of Virgil, the master poet from Mantua who lived during the reign of Julius Caesar, before the coming of Christ.  Directing Dante to take a path around the beasts on the hillside, Virgil becomes Dante's teacher and guide through Hell and parts of Purgatory.
	Inferno section 2: Night begins to fall on Virgil and Dante as they begin their journey.  Invoking the Muses with, ""O Muses, o high genius, help me now,"" Dante wonders whether or not he is worthy to take such a momentous trip.  Comparing himself to others-Aeneas and St. Paul-- who have journeyed into the underworld, Dante does not feel he is up to the task.  Virgil comforts Dante and quells his misgivings by telling him that Beatrice, sent by the Virgin Mary, asked Virgil to rescue Dante from his wanderings and to be his guide for her sake.  After Virgil asks Dante, ""Why do you resist? Why does your heart host so much cowardice? Where are your daring and your openness,"" Dante gathers his resolve and the pair move on.
	Inferno section 3: Dante's first encounter with Hell is the inscription over its gates, ""Through me the way into the suffering city, through me the way to the eternal pain, through me the way that runs among the lost.Abandon every hope, who enter here."" Virgil reminds Dante to have courage and leads him into Hell, a dark and starless abyss filled with terrible noise.  Virgil explains that the cries that Dante hears are those of the uncommitted, souls who were neither rebellious against God nor faithful to Satan.  These souls occupy the Vestibule, a portion of Hell outside the formal First Circle.  Neither Heaven nor Hell would take these souls so their punishment is to spend eternity running through the Vestibule behind a banner while wasps and horseflies sting them and worms at their feet feed on their blood and tears. 
	Dante and Virgil continue to the river Acheron, the border between the Vestibule and the First Circle.  Many souls wait on the shores of the river for the boatman, Charon to carry them across.  Charon does not want to help Dante because he is still alive but Virgil, as he will often do during this journey, commands the underworld guardian to let Dante pass because his mission was willed in Heaven.  As they cross the river, Virgil tells Dante that the sinners on the shores are compelled by ""celestial justice"" to cross the river into Hell.  As the poet finishes his discussion of Charon and the river, violent winds and fires from the ground accompany the tremors of a giant earthquake.  Terrified by the chaotic rumblings, Dante faints away.
	Inferno section 4: Loud thunder stirs Dante from his sleep.  Dante finds himself in a new place, on the edge of an abyss the bottom of which he cannot see.  As Virgil and Dante descend into the First Circle, Limbo, they hear quiet sighs and moans of sadness.  Virgil explains that the souls that make these pitiful sounds belong to humans who led blameless lives but were never baptized.  Virgil, who died before Christianity, lives in Limbo where his punishment is to never be able to see God.  Dante expresses sorrow because the souls he meets in Limbo belong to great men.  As Virgil and Dante walk, Dante sees a fire around which the most honored souls rest.  As they approach the fire, Dante recognizes the shades (spirits) as Homer, Horace, Lucan, and Ovid, great classical poets.  The group salutes Dante as one of them as the stroll toward a castle with seven walls surrounded by a stream.  Upon entering the enclosed area, Dante finds more masters of ancient philosophy and mathematics-Plato, Cicero, Socrates, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and ""the master of the men who know"" (Aristotle).  Dante and Virgil move from this hallowed, calm place to a place ""where no thing gleams.""
	Inferno section 5: As Dante and Virgil descend in the Second Circle they meet Minos whose job it is to judge condemned souls.  Minos wraps his tail around his body to indicate the number of the circle in Hell to which the soul must fall.  Again, Virgil commands Minos to let Dante pass because his journey was commanded in Heaven (although Virgil does not use the word ""Heaven"" because to do so in Hell would be blasphemous).  Once Minos lets the poets pass they encounter a pit filled with shrieking and moaning spirits that flail about in the winds of an eternal storm.  The Second Circle houses the souls that were lustful on Earth.  Dante pities these souls and asks to speak with one of them.  Meet Francesca, a woman whose husband kills her and her beloved Paolo for succumbing to one lustful kiss.  Paolo stands by as Francesca tells their story.  Moved by pity and sadness, Dante faints.

Inferno section 6: Dante awakens to find himself in the Third Circle where rain, snow, and hail fall endlessly to the stinking ground.  Here, the Gluttons run around the pit eternally trying to avoid the sharp claws of the three-headed guardian of this Circle, Cerberus.  As Virgil throws dirt into the monster's mouth to silence him, Dante notices a shade that, unlike the other spirits, does not lie on the ground.  This spirit belongs to Ciacco, a citizen of Florence who Dante knew in life.  Ciacco, well known for his gluttony, prophesies that war will occur and one party will be expelled from the city.  The two Florentines commiserate over the plight of their city and discuss the fates of other citizens who, Ciacco says, were banished to lower parts of Hell for their heinous crimes.  As Virgil and Dante move away, Virgil explains to Dante that Ciacco will stay as he is in this Circle until Last Judgement.  Although these souls will never reach Heaven, they will be nearer to it and feel more pleasure and more pain after Last Judgement.
	Inferno section 7: Plutus, who has swelled to an enormous size, blocks the poets' path as they try to descend into the Fourth Circle.  But when Virgil explains that their journey is willed in Heaven, Plutus falls weakly to the ground and the Virgil and Dante pass unharmed.  In the Fourth Circle, two groups of shades roll giant weights in opposite directions.  At the end of their semi-circular paths the two groups crash into each other and continue their torment again in the opposite direction.  Every time the two groups crash, one yells, ""Why do you hoard?"" While the other group yells, ""Why do you squander?"" These two groups, the avaricious and the prodigal, continue this sorry task for all eternity.  Virgil explains that most of the spirits in this realm belong to popes, priests, and cardinals who mismanaged worldly goods whether with avarice or with prodigality.  Virgil also warns Dante against being greedy for the goods of Fortune.  Dante asks him to explain Fortune and Virgil responds, ""She is the one so frequently maligned even by those who should give praise to her-they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.  But she is blessed and does not hear these things; for with the other primal beings, happy, she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss.""
	With that, Virgil beckons Dante to follow him into the next Circle.  As they descend, they approach the river Styx and find the souls of the Wrathful and Sullen bobbing in the slimy murk.  The Fifth Circle of Hell belongs to the Wrathful shades who lash out at each other, tearing ""each other piecemeal with their teeth."" Alongside the Wrathful live the Sullen shades who, because they ""had been sullen in the sweet air that's gladdened by the sun,"" must spend eternity stuck below the dark, festering mud of Styx.  Virgil and Dante continue their trek around the river until they come to the base of a tower. 
	Inferno section 8: Dante and Virgil spy two flames in the distance as they near the tower.  These flames signal the approach of Phlegyas, the oarsman who takes the poets across the river.  As the three cross Styx, a shade rises from the mud and tries to attack Dante.  At first Dante does not recognize the shade but when he finally realizes that the spirit is that of Filippo Argenti, Dante curses the shade and sends him flailing back into the water.  Virgil praises Dante for his actions and explains that the city of Dis lies ahead of them.  Dis stands as the entrance to the lower part of Hell, reserved for the worst violent and fraudulent sinners.  Fallen angels angrily block the path into Dis.  They refuse to speak with Dante so Virgil proceeds alone to convince the fallen angels to let them pass.
	Inferno section 9: The fallen angels refuse to let Virgil and Dante pass through the gates so Virgil returns to Dante and explains that help has been promised to them so they must wait for that help to arrive.  Frightened by their situation, Dante tries to gather courage by asking Virgil about other mortals who had taken the journey through Hell.  Virgil reveals that he himself was sent to summon a spirit in a Circle far below the one in which they now stand.  Dante has little time to comfort himself as three bloody and terrifying Furies appear before the poets.  Their heads covered in snakes, the Furies, Erinyes, Megaera, and Allecto summon Medusa to turn Dante into stone.  Dante and Virgil cover Dante's eyes but do not cower long because a great noise announces the arrival of a spirit who crosses Styx without touching the water.  The heavenly messenger arrives at the gates of Dis and admonishes the fallen angels for not allowing the poets passage.  The messenger opens the gates and abruptly turns to leave.  Dante and Virgil enter Dis and see a field covered with flaming sepulchers.  Dante hears mournful cries emanating from the coffins and Virgil explains that the cries belong to the arch-heretics whose tombs lie here.
	Inferno section 10: Dante asks to speak to one of the spirits lying in its tomb.  Virgil allows him to speak to Farinata, a former Ghibelline who fought against Dante's ancestors.  A spirit in a nearby tomb interrupts Dante's conversation with Farinata to inquire about his son, Guido.  Dante uses the past tense to describe Guido so, thinking his son is dead, the shade crashes back into his tomb before Dante can finish his sentence.  Farinata resumes his discussion with Dante, telling him that he will have difficulty returning to Florence from his exile and asking him why their two political parties hate each other so much.  In turn, Dante asks Farinata to explain why spirits can see into the past and into the future but they cannot see the present.  Farinata explains, ""We see, even as men who are farsighted, those things.that are remote from us; the Highest Lord allots us that much light.  But when events draw near or are, our minds are useless; were we not informed by others, we should know nothing of our human state."" As Dante moves away, he asks Farinata to tell Guido's father that his son is not dead.  Hearing Virgil call, Dante returns to his master and the two poets move into a new, accursed valley.

379,Divine Comedy: Novel Summary: Inferno section 11- Inferno section 15,"Inferno section 11: Still in the Sixth Circle, Dante and Virgil pause behind the tomb of Pope Anastasius to acclimate to the vile stench that now surrounds them.  To pass the time, Virgil instructs Dante on what lies ahead.  Virgil explains that the next Circle (Seven) holds sinners who were violent against their neighbors, against themselves, and against God and Nature.  Sinners who committed ten different types of ""ordinary"" fraud live in Circle Eight while traitors who committed treacherous fraud-against kindred, country, guests, and masters-live in Circle Nine closest to Satan.  Dante wonders why the sinners guilty of incontinence (Circles Two through Five) live outside the walls of Dis.  Virgil reminds Dante of Aristotle's Ethicsin which the author explains why incontinence is less offensive to God than fraud because people commit acts of incontinence without malice.  The poets' discussion then moves to the subject of usury. When a man tries to evade the labors necessary to live by nature and by his own art, he commits usury, an act that violates God's plan.  Virgil closes the discussion by asking Dante to follow him down the cliff into the next Circle.
	Inferno section 12: Upon descending the rocky cliff, Dante and Virgil come to an opening that is guarded by the Minotaur.  In a great rage, the Minotaur can do nothing to stop this journey.  The poets descend through the opening quickly.  As they climb down, Virgil instructs Dante to look below to view the river of boiling blood where the violent sinners live.  Dante sees that centaurs stand at the banks of this river, launching arrows at the shades in the river who act out of order.  The centaurs spy the poets and send three of their own-Nessus, Chiron, and Pholus-to meet them. Chiron speaks first, noting that the rocks move under Dante's feet indicating that Dante is still alive.  Chiron sends Nessus to carry Dante across the river of blood.  As they glide across the river, Nessus explains that the sinners sunk deepest were tyrants and murderers on Earth.  Once they reach the ford over the river, Nessus leaves Dante and explains that the river grows deeper on the other side of the ford where major tyrants like Attila reside.
	Inferno section 13: Still in the Seventh Circle, Dante and Virgil enter a dark and foreboding forest.  Dante notices that the trees in this wood have strange black leaves on misshapen branches and poison sticks rather than fruit.  Harpies nest in the barren branches.  Virgil explains that this second round of the Seventh Circle houses people who committed suicide.  For their punishment, these sinners have been turned into trees.  Pulling a branch from one of the trees, Dante is surprised when the tree-spirit responds in agony from the pain of losing its branch.  Dante feels pity for the spirit and asks it to tell its story.  The spirit belongs to the man who served as a faithful aid to Fredrick II.  But when Fredrick turned against him he could not stand to be out of his master's favor so he killed himself.  Virgil asks the spirit to explain how the suicides become trees.  The sad shade describes that when a soul is ripped from its body by suicide it is sent to this Circle by Minos where it sprouts roots and grows from the fetid soil.  The trees then spend eternity feeling horrible pain as Harpies eat their leaves.  As the tree-spirit finishes its story, the poets hear a great rumble thundering through the forest.  Chased by black bitches as fast as greyhounds, two spirits belonging to Lano and Jacopo da Santo Andrea seek cover behind a spirit-bush to no avail.  The dogs easily catch the spirits and tear it to shreds.
	Inferno section 14: Dante and Virgil move into the last round of the Seventh Circle where those who were violent against God (blasphemers) spend eternity.  A vast and desolate plane sprawls before the poets as they behold numerous souls lying, crouching, and wandering across the desert.  The desert floor burns as flakes of fire continuously scorches the sand.  Dante turns to one spirit lying in the sand that seems undaunted by the rain of fire.  This soul, Capeneus, defied gods in ancient times and was struck down by Zeus.  Yet Capeneus still thinks of himself as unconquered and, therefore, still blasphemous despite his horrendous punishment.  Virgil admonishes the spirit and calls Dante to move on.  Dante and Virgil come to a deep red river and realize that they must use it as a path through the desert.  As they follow the river, Virgil describes the legend of a great creature that lives in the island of Crete.  From this creature flow the tears that collect in Hell and form the great rivers: Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon.  The river that they now follow will lead them to Cocytus (Satan) at the very bottom of Hell.  In response to Virgil's description, Dante asks, ""But if the rivulet must follow such a course down from our world, why can we see it only at this boundary?"" Virgil replies that as they have descended into Hell (which is shaped like a circular cone) they have traveled to the left and have not yet made a complete circle.
	Inferno section 15: Still walking along the river in the Seventh Circle, Dante enters the area of Hell reserved for those who were violent against God-the Sodomites.  As the poets walk across the burning plain, a group of shades approaches them.  Dante recognizes one of the spirits as that belonging to Ser Brunetto.  After Dante explains how Virgil found him and brought him to Hell, Brunetto prophesies Dante's fame and gives him details of his exile.  Brunetto was one of Dante's mentors in life so upon meeting him in Hell, Dante feels sorrowful and speaks to his friend with kindness and gratitude.  As they conclude their conversation, Dante asks Brunetto who else dwells in this part of Hell.  Brunetto mentions a few, all-renowned scholars who were guilty of sodomy (although Brunetto does not identify this crime by name).  Another group of spirits approaches Dante and Brunetto.  Brunetto runs off because he is not allowed to be with those spirits.

Inferno section 16: Dante and Virgil approach a waterfall cascading into the lower regions of Hell.  As they approach the falls, three spirits leave a group of spirits because they recognize Dante's garb as Florentine.  The three spirits belong to Guido Guerra, Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, and Jacopo Rusticucci-all notable patriarchs of Florence who belonged to Dante's political party.  The spirits wish Dante much fame and ask if Florence has changed.  Dante responds with regret, ""Newcomers to the city and quick gains have brought excess and arrogance to you, o Florence, and you weep for it already!"" As they retreat, the spirits ask Dante to speak of them when he returns to Earth.  Dante and Virgil make their way to the waterfall.  Virgil asks Dante to give him the coil wrapped around his waist.  Virgil tosses the coil into the waterfall to signal the beast that will carry Dante into the depths below.
	Inferno section 17: ""Behold the beast who bears the pointed tail, who crosses mountains, shatters weapons, walls! Behold the one whose stench fills all the world!"" Dante announces as Geryon, the monster summoned by Virgil to escort Dante past the waterfall, appears.  Dante describes Geryon in vivid terms: the face of an old man with gracious features, the trunk and tail of a serpent, two paws, and hair up to his armpits.  Virgil instructs Dante to talk to a group of spirits sitting by the waterfall while he convinces Geryon to be their escort.  Dante pauses to talk to the spirits who occupy a separate zone of the Seventh Circle, set aside for those who were violent against Nature and Art (Usurers).  The Usurers also suffer from the flakes of falling fire but the also wear pouches around their necks.  On each pouch sits a different crest.  These crests are the only things that differentiate one spirit from another because their faces are indistinguishable.  The Usureers do not treat Dante kindly.  One spirit sticks out its tongue at Dante who retreats quickly to rejoin Virgil.  Dante mounts Geryon who takes him on a terrifying flight to the landing below.  Upon setting the poet down, Geryon flies away like an arrow.
	Inferno section 18: ""There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, made all of stone the color of crude iron, as is the wall that makes its way around it."" Thus, begins Dante's journey through the lower regions of Hell.  Malebolge means ""evil pouches."" Ten pouches, aligned in concentric circles, make up the Eighth Circle where ""ordinary fraud"" is punished.  Dante and Virgil first see a deep valley where sinners who were panderers or seducers walk constantly in both directions as horned demons flog and torment them.  Dante recognizes one sinner and calls him by name, Caccianemico.  This sinner tells of how he arranged for the seduction of his own sister.  Dante and Virgil continue across the first chasm and come to the second chasm where flatterers are sunk in excrement.  Dante recognizes Allessio Interminei who explains that he is sunk to the top of his head because in life he could never stop his flattery.  Upon seeing the woman, Thais, who flattered her lover extravagantly, the poets move away into the next area of Malebolge.
	Inferno section 19: The third chasm of the Eighth Circle holds the Simonists, clergy members who trade the favor of the church for money.  Deeply opposed to papal interference in public life, Dante takes this opportunity in the book to rail against these sinners.  The Simonists must spend eternity upside down in holes.  Protruding from holes, the legs and feet of these shades burn with flames.  Dante sees one spirit suffering from more pain than the others.  He approaches the spirit to find that it belongs to a pope (Nicholas III).  Dante reproves Nicholas by recounting the story of Jesus and Peter who asked for no money when they chose Matthias to take the place of Judas.  Virgil, pleased by Dante's tirade against the pope, carries Dante across this chasm to a bridge above the next valley.
	Inferno section 20: In the fourth pouch of the Eighth Circle, Dante finds the Diviners, Astrologers, and Magicians who all tried to foretell the future-a sin against God's plan.  With their heads placed backwards on their bodies, these shades must spend eternity walking backwards.  Dante meets Manto, the sorceress who founded the city of Mantua, Virgil's birthplace.  Manto tells the long story of the founding of Mantua.  Virgil points out other shades in this realm: Eurypylus, Michael Scott, a writer of occult sciences, Guido Bonati, Asdente, and numerous women who became women.  Virgil hurries Dante as the moon sets.

Inferno section 21: Virgil and Dante come to the center of the bridge that crosses the fifth pouch of the Eighth Circle where they find the Barrators-those who profited from their positions in public office-mired in a river of boiling pitch.  Malebranche (Evil Claws) demons approach the poets with a new spirit from the city of Lucca who they throw into the chasm below.  Virgil tells Dante to hide from the demons while he secures their guidance across the river.  The demons start to attack Virgil but he holds them off by asking to talk to one of them.  Malacoda (Evil Tail) steps forward to ask Virgil why he wishes to speak to them.  Virgil explains that the demons cannot hurt Dante because their journey was willed in Heaven.  Malacoda orders the other demons not to attack and instead calls ten of his sidekicks forward to escort the poets to the next chasm while they prod and torment the sinners in the pitch to ensure that they do not escape.  The rebellious demons taunt Dante but do as they are told.  The group proceeds to the next pouch.
	Inferno section 22: As the noisy party marches up the river, Dante's attention turns to the sinners in the pitch.  He notices that most of the sinners stay submerged but some leap out like dolphins while others sit like frogs with only their heads breaking the surface of the sludge.  As the demons approach, all but one sinner dives beneath the surface.  The demon Graffiacane hooks the remaining sinner and drags him to shore.  The demons flog and claw the shade.  Dante asks to know the name of this unfortunate soul.  The hapless shade replies that he was from Navarre and served King Thibaut.  He reports to Dante that he used his position to sell political favors and now must suffer the consequences in Hell.  As the demons attack the Barrator from Navarre, Dante asks if any Latian sinners reside here.  The tormented shade replies that both Friar Gomita of Gallura and Don Michel Zanche from Sardinia lie below.  Continuing to claw and jab at the spirit, the wild demons begin to quarrel amongst themselves.  The shade from Navarre seizes his opportunity to escape by diving back into the pitch.  Furious, two demons fly after him.  One demon pulls up just as it reaches the surface of the pitch.  Angry with his compatriot for missing the shade, the other demon attacks his colleague and the two battle like birds of prey in midair.  As the demons fight they too fall into the pitch and cannot fly.  Dante and Virgil walk quietly away from the chaotic scene. 
	Inferno section 23: Dante feels uneasy as he and Virgil leave the demons.  He fears that the demons will blame them for their fight and pursue them as a hawk would pursue a mouse.  In fact, the demons are chasing them so Virgil quickly scoops Dante into his arms and descends down to the sixth pouch.  The demons cannot leave their realm so they watch helplessly from above as their prey escapes.  In the sixth pouch, Dante and Virgil find spirits walking very slowly.  Cloaked in hoods and garments that appear dazzling but are lined with lead, these shades-the Hypocrites-must spend eternity bearing these deceptively beautiful instruments of torture.  Dante crosses paths with spirits who belonged to Jovial Firars, men who were supposed to govern Florence.  The Friars discuss the rationale behind some of the punishments bestowed upon their brethren.  Virgil asks where they will find a bridge to cross this chasm.  The Friars respond that all the bridges were destroyed at the same time.  Realizing that Malacoda had lied to him about the bridges, Virgil storms angrily away.
	Inferno section 24: Somewhat stunned by Virgil's anger, Dante follows his master downcast and wary.  Virgil puts his pupil at ease, though, when he turns to him wearing a calm and benign expression.  Virgil finds a place where they can climb out of this chasm.  Since he is weightless, Virgil pushes Dante from behind as he struggles up the rocky and treacherous cliff.  When they reach the top, Dante falls to the ground in exhaustion.  Virgil implores him to keep moving so the two travelers continue to the next chasm-seventh pouch.  This new chasm holds the Thieves who must spend eternity running naked through the darkness as serpents chase them.  Dante spies a gruesome sight: thrust through the loins of a shade, the head and tail of a serpent clasp in a knot about the body of the shade while the rest of the serpent's body coils around the shade's hands behind its back.  Another serpent sinks its fangs into the neck of the shade that then turns to ashes, only to take shape again and repeat its misery.  Dante finds that this spirit belongs to Vanni Fucci of Pistoia, a man who robbed the sacristy of a church.  Vanni prophesies that Dante's White party will lose a battle at Pistoia.
	Inferno section 25: Vanni Fucci curses God and makes an obscene gesture.  To silence him, a serpent wraps itself around Vanni's neck and Dante believes that the sinner has gotten what he deserves.  Chased by a horrible monster, Vanni runs away.  Virgil identifies the monster as Cacus, the creature that was killed by Hercules for stealing his cattle.  Five Florentine Thieves approach Dante-three of them humans and two of them serpents.  Of the encounter, Dante writes, ""As I kept my eyes fixed on those sinners, a serpent with six feet springs out against one of the three, and clutches him completely.  It gripped his belly with its middle feet, and with its forefeet grappled his two arms; and then sank its teeth in both his cheeks.Then just as if their substance were warm wax, they stuck together and they mixed their colors, so neither seemed what he had been before; just as, when paper's kindled, where it still has not caught flame in full, its color's dark though not yet black, while white is dying off."" Dante vividly describes this metamorphosis as snake and human become one being and then trade forms.  He goes on to describe other similar scenes including that of a reptile creating smoke by biting one of the human spirits.

Inferno section 26: Still in the seventh pouch of the Eighth Circle, Dante opens here with an invective against Florence, ""Be joyous, Florence, you are great indeed, for over sea and land you beat your wings; through every part of Hell your name extends!"" The travelers now move to the eighth pouch where the evil counselors dwell.  Numerous flames spread across the darkness like fireflies.  Virgil explains that these flames hold the spirits of the sinners.  Dante sees a divided flame and asks Virgil to whom this fire belongs.  Virgil explains that Ulysses and Diomede share this flame because together they plotted the invasion of the Trojan horse and they also separated Achilles from Deidamia, who died of a broken heart.  Dante approaches Ulysses who eagerly recalls the dramatic story of his death at sea. 
	Inferno section 27: A flame near the flame of Ulysses tries to speak in unintelligible tones.  Finally, once it has controlled itself, the flame asks to speak politely and wonders if anyone knows whether there is war or peace in his former Latian land.  A Latian himself, Dante jumps into a discourse about the past and present situation in the cities that make up his home region: Ravenna, Romagna, Cervia, Forli, Montagna, and Cesena.  According to Dante, most of these cities are misruled.  Dante asks for the name of the spirit who eagerly reveals that he was a soldier who became a brother of the order of St. Francis.  St. Bonafice asked the spirit, Guido da Montefeltro, to devise a plan to make war against other Christians and absolved Guido for this sin in advance.  The war plan was successful but when Guido died a demon claimed his soul because the absolution made by Bonafice was not valid.  Guido ends his story and moves away as the poets advance to the next bridge.
	Inferno section 28: Here in the ninth pouch of the Eighth Circle dwell the Sowers of Scandal and Schism.  Dante warns his readers of the gruesome details that are to follow.  As the poets cross this chasm, they first cross paths with Mohammed.  Mohammed, disemboweled, speaks of his successor, Ali, who is likewise mangled and circling the chasm for eternity.  Mohammed explains that when their wounds heal, a demon wounds them with a sword again and the process starts again.  As Dante and Mohammed talk, a large group of spirits crowds around to listen.  Mohammed asks Dante to tell one of his living brethren, Fra Dolcino, to supply himself with food so that the Novarese will not be victorious when the winter snows fall.  A different spirit to carry the message to Messer Guido and Angiolello that they will be drowned at sea.  Yet another shade, whose hands are cut off, enters the discussion.  This spirit belongs to Mosca, a leader whose bad counsel began the rivalry between the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Florence.  Dante speaks harshly to Mosca who, pained by Dante's comments, sulks away.  Finally, a headless sinner approaches the group.  This spirit belongs to Bertrand de Born, an evil counselor whose scandal caused a father and son to become enemies.  He must now spend eternity pacing the depths of Hell with his brain, that which created the plot, severed from his body.
	Inferno section 29: Dante weeps sorrowfully as he leaves the Sowers of Scandal behind.  He laments that he had been looking for an ancestor of his whose murder had not yet been avenged.  Virgil reveals that he saw Dante's ancestor, Geri del Bello, crouching under a bridge while Dante spoke to the group of shades.  Geri, Virgil explains, was so angry about the fact that his death has not been avenged that he refused to speak.  Dante still feels sorry for his ancestor but continues to the ninth pouch.  At the bridge over this chasm, Dante hears tremendous wails and smells a stench that reminds him of rotting human limbs.  Dante and Virgil move to a spot where they can better view the resting place of the Falsifiers.  Most of these sinners lie in a grotesque and diseased heap while others crawl about aimlessly.  Dante notices two shades furiously scratching scabs off one another as if they were both scaling fish.  Dante asks the shades for their names and their stories.  The first spirit identifies himself as an alchemist from Arezzo.  Minos sent him to this Circle because alchemy is a form of falsifying.  The second spirit proudly identifies himself as Capocchio, another famous alchemist.
	Inferno section 30: Dante opens this canto with a recount of ancient Greeks who had gone insane as a preface to the following scene: ""But neither fury-Theban, Trojan-ever was seen to be so cruel against another, in rending beasts and even human limbs, as were two shades I saw, both pale and naked, who, biting, ran berserk in just the way a hod does when it's let loose in its sty.  The one came at Capocchio and sank his tusks into his neck so that, by dragging, he made the hard ground scrape against his belly."" The remaining shade from Arezzo explains that the two shades that attack Capocchio belong to Gianni Schicchi and Myrrha.  Schicchi and Myrrha reside in the part of Hell reserved for Counterfeiters of Other Persons (another type of falsifying) because they both pretended to be other people.  After all of these shades retreat, Dante looks around at other miserable souls.  He sees the soul belonging to Master Adam, swollen with dropsy.  Master Adam was a counterfeiter of coins in Florence.  Dante asks Adam for the names of other sinners nearby.  As Adam begins to reveal the names of those around him, one of the shades, insulted by the conversation, attacks Adam.  The two start to quarrel while Dante listens quietly.  Virgil admonishes Dante for listening to the fight and urges him onward.

Inferno section 31: As Virgil and Dante climb to the crest of the next chasm, the Ninth Circle, they hear a thunderous horn.  Dante looks in the direction of the sound and sees huge towers in the distance.  Taking Dante by the hand, Virgil explains that the towers that he sees are actually the silhouettes of giants mired in mud.  As the poets approach, Dante gets a better view of the entrance into the final pit. The giants, anomalies of Nature, encircle the pit like a turret.  As Dante describes these monstrosities, one of them begins to yell gibberish.  Virgil tells the giant that he is stupid because he must use the horn that hangs around his neck to vent his frustration.  This giant, Virgil explains, is Nimrod, the builder of the Tower of Babel.  Dante and Virgil approach the next giant, Ephialtes, who is wrapped with a chain.  Dante wishes to see the giant Briareus but Virgil explains that he too is tied with chains, so the poets will only see Antaeus who can set them on the bottom of the pit because he is not tied in chains.  Virgil greets Antaeus by recalling all of the giant's deeds on Earth.  He tells Antaeus that Dante will bring him great fame if he helps the poet descend.  The giant gingerly stoops to lift Dante then sets him down in the pit where Judas and Satan live.
	Inferno section 32: Dante and Virgil emerge in the Ninth (and final) Circle of Hell.  Before them lies a frozen wasteland that defies description.  Dante invokes the Muses to help him find the language to speak the truth about this abyss.  The poets begin to move through the first ring, Caina, where Traitors to their Kin are immersed in ice.  A voice warns Dante not to step on the spirits who are sunk to their chin in the crystal clear ice.  Dante looks down at his feet and sees two brothers immersed together.  As the brothers weep, their tears freeze, binding them closer together.  Dante continues on his journey and accidentally kicks the face of a frozen spirit.  This spirit wails in pain and sorrow and demands to know how Dante can walk through Antenora, the second circle, kicking shades.  Antenora holds the Traitors to their Homeland or their Party so Dante wants to know the name of the shade with which he now speaks.  The shade refuses to give its name so Dante begins to pull at the spirit's hair.  The two tussle until another spirit reveals that the feisty shade belongs to Bocca.  Angrily, Bocca starts to name other traitors confined to Antenora as Dante moves away.  On his way past these traitors, Dante notices a spirit feeding on the head and neck of another sinner lying nearby.
	Inferno section 33: Dante tells the carnivorous shade that he will bring it fame on Earth if it reveals its story to him.  Weeping, the shade replies that it will gladly tell its story because in doing so it will reveal the name of the shade upon which it feeds.  The first spirit belongs to Count Ugolino while the second one belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri.  Ruggieri captured Ugolino and put him to death.  Dante already knew that Ruggieri had killed Ugolino but he was not aware of the cruel details of Ugolino's death.  Ugolino recounts that he when he awoke in prison he heard his sons asking for food.  Rather than bringing the men food, Ruggieri's henchmen nailed the doors of the prison shut and let all five die of starvation.  One by one, Ugolino heard his sons die then he himself died from hunger.  The story saddens Dante because although Ugolino betrayed the locations of strongholds in Pisa, his sons had done nothing wrong and did not deserve to die in such a tormented manner. 
	Dante and Virgil move to the third ring (Ptolomaea) where Traitors against Their Guests jut out of the ice, their eyes frozen shut by their tears.  One of the shades calls to Dante to take the ice from its eyelids.  Dante agrees to do so if the shade reveals its name.  The spirit agrees and states that it belongs to Friar Alberigo, a man who murdered his younger brother.  Dante did not know that this man was already dead.  He believes that his spirit must have descended into Hell while a demon occupies Alberigo's body on Earth.  Dante finds his hypothesis to be true when he notices the spirit belonging to Branca d'Oria resting nearby.  Alberigo implores Dante to remove the ice from his eyes as he had promised.  Dante refuses, believing rudeness to be a grace in Hell.  Instead, Dante curses the Genoese because the body of one of their countrymen currently walks the Earth inhabited by a demon.
	Inferno section 34: Virgil and Dante finally arrive at the fourth ring of the Ninth Circle (Judecca) where the Traitors against their Benefactors lie fully covered in ice.  Carefully stepping across the encased spirits, Dante emerges from the wind and mist in full view of Satan (Dis).  Frozen up to his breast in the ice of Cocytus, Satan stands larger and more ominous than any creature Dante could imagine.  His arms are greater than the height of one of the giants that they had just passed and three gigantic pairs of wings fanning the wind that freezes the pit.  Satan has three heads-red, black, and yellow-and from his six eyes streams continuous tears.  In each of its mouths, Satan gnaws on the worst of the traitors: Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.  Virgil abruptly tells Dante that they must leave.  Virgil pulls his pupil onto his back and begins to climb down Satan's hairy body.  Virgil continues to climb until they come to a point where Satan's legs stand upright in a dark cave.  Virgil explains that when they climbed down Satan's side, they passed the center of the center of the earth so that they now stand just below the Southern Hemisphere.  Satan stands where he was planted when he originally fell from Heaven.  Dante quickly scrambles to climb back to Earth and as he does he sees stars above him for the first time since his journey began.
	Purgatorio section 1: ""To course across more kindly waters now my talent's little vessel lifts her sails, leaving behind herself a sea so cruel; and what I sing will be that second kingdom, in which the human soul is cleansed of sin becoming worthy of ascent to Heaven."" Thus, Dante opens his journey into Purgatory where he will use kinder words to describe the ascent.  To prepare himself, Dante calls upon the Muses including Calliope, the Muse of poetry.  Dante and Virgil arrive at the island where the Mountain of Purgatory stands on Easter morning.  Dante notices a constellation of four stars that have not been seen by humans since Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden.  The guardian of the region, Cato, emerges and demands to know how Dante escaped Hell.  Virgil explains that a lady in Heaven asked him to save Dante's soul before it is lost by guiding Dante through Hell.  Virgil was also directed to show Dante how the souls under Cato's charge are purged and prepared for Heaven.  Cato consents to the journey and allows the poets to pass.  Before they can pass, however, Dante must wash the dirt from Hell off of his face and he must pluck a rush from the shore to gird himself.  After Dante performs these rituals, the poets set off to find the path up the Mountain.

Purgatorio section 2: As the sun rises on Purgatory, Dante spies a ship sailing across the sea toward the island at a great rate.  Virgil instructs Dante to kneel and fold his hands because it is an angel that guides the boat and propels it with its wings.  The brightness of the angel's face blinds Dante.  As the ship approaches, Dante hears the voices of hundreds of spirits aboard the boat singing a psalm.  When the spirits land on the island they ask Dante and Virgil for directions to the path.  Virgil explains that they too are new arrivals and the spirits realize that Dante is still alive because they can see him breathing.  Meanwhile, a spirit, Casella, recognizes Dante.  Dante tries to embrace Casella three times but because she is a spirit, she has no mass and Dante's arms close around air.  Casella put some of Dante's poems to music so Dante asks her to sing a song for him.  The other spirits gather around to listen to the sweet song but Cato ends the diversion by reminding everyone that their mission to climb the mountain is urgent.  The spirits disperse and begin their journey.
	Purgatorio section 3: When the travelers enter Ante-Purgatory Dante suffers a moment of fear when he notices that he is the only one who casts a shadow.  Virgil explains that he casts a shadow because he is alive.  Many great thinkers have tried to understand why spirits can be seen but do not have mass or cast shadows.  Virgil explains that this phenomenon is one of God's mysteries and is beyond human comprehension.  Virgil then explains the same phenomenon to a group of approaching spirits that are shocked to see Dante's shadow.  One of the spirits in the group approaches Dante.  This spirit belongs to Manfred, the illegitimate son of Fredrick II.  Manfred begs Dante to tell his daughter that he repented before he died and that he regrets that his body did not get a proper burial.  Manfred explains to Dante that even people who repent at the last minute are granted salvation but they must stay in Purgatory thirty times as long as the length of their rebellion against the Church.  Manfred hopes that his daughter's prayers will take some time off of his stay in Purgatory.
	Purgatorio section 4: Dante's conversation with Manfred has made Dante lose track of time.  He uses this incident to contradict the notion of the plurality of souls doctrine.  Virgil and Dante come to a cleft in the rocks where they begin their climb toward the summit.  Dante finds the climb through the First Spur, where the Late-Repentant due to negligence dwell, extremely difficult and must stop at a ledge to rest.  While they rest, Dante notices that although they face the sun, the sun appears on his left.  Virgil explains that Purgatory stands on the opposite hemisphere from Jerusalem and since scientists believed that the world only had one hemisphere, this geography made perfect sense to Dante.  As the two begin their ascent once again, Virgil comforts Dante by telling him that the climb will become increasingly easier as they approach the summit.  As they climb, Dante encounters one of his friends, Belaqua, whose sarcastic taunting prompts Dante to tell his friend that he will no longer grieve for him.  Virgil urges his pupil to hurry on.
	Purgatorio section 5: Dante and Virgil move to the Second Spur where the Late-Repentant who died by violence spend their time in Purgatory.  As they walk, a large group of spirits approach them singing a psalm.  Once they realize that Dante is alive they beg him to send news to their loved ones on Earth.  These spirits did not receive the sacrament because they died by violence so prayers from their friends and families will make their time in Purgatory shorter.  Various spirits from this group including Jacopo del Cassero and Buonconte da Montefeltro tell their tales of death in battle.  Buonconte reveals that an angel and a demon fought over his soul after he died but the angel finally took possession of him because of a little tear that appeared in his eye.  Finally, the spirit belonging to La Pia, a lady from Siena, asks Dante to remember her when he returns to Earth.
	Purgatorio section 6: Dante compares his situation in Purgatory to that of a gambler who has won: ""When dicing's done and players separate, the loser's left alone, disconsolate-rehearsing what he'd thrown, he sadly learns; all of the crowd surrounds the one who won-one goes in front, and one tugs at his back, and at his side one asks to be remembered."" Nearly every spirit that he meets urges Dante to ask for prayers on its behalf.  Virgil once wrote that prayers from loved ones do not help souls in Purgatory.  Dante questions him on this opinion and Virgil explains that the passage that he wrote referred to a pagan who would not be helped by prayers; Christians do, however, leave Purgatory earlier when God's heard prayers on their behalf.  Virgil also admits, though, that Beatrice will give him the final answers to all of his questions so Dante is eager to continue their journey.  Virgil and Dante encounter a spirit named Sordello from Mantua along their path.  Virgil, who is also a Mantuan, embraces Sordello.  Dante uses this opportunity to illustrate how people from the same city used to stay connected while people today act like strangers to each other.  Dante delivers a scorching invective against the people of Italy then he turns his anger to the Florentines who, he believes, have become especially bad neighbors.

Purgatorio section 7: The scene returns to Virgil and Sordello, fellow Mantuans.  Sordello asks Virgil to identify himself.  Struck with awe that he has encountered the great poet, Sordello bows down and exclaims that Virgil has brought great honor to the city of Mantua.  Sordello wonders where Virgil now lives.  Virgil explains that he dwells with other virtuous pagans who practiced the cardinal virtues but did not practice the three holy virtues.  Finally, Virgil once again asks Sordello for directions up the mountain.  Sordello leads the travelers to a beautiful valley filled with sweet flowers.  Sordello points out some of the notable figures that dwell in this valley: Henry of Navarre, Peter III of Aragon, and Charles I of Anjou.  These shades give the valley its name, Valley of the Rulers.  The spirits are consigned to this spot because they too neglected to repent.  Dante uses this example to show that one's character is not necessarily noble even when one comes from a noble line of birth-an issue hotly debated during Dante's time.
	Purgatorio section 8: Darkness falls on the Valley of the Rulers.  The spirits begin to sing an evening devotion, ""Te lucis ante."" Two angels take posts in the Valley to stand guard for the night.  Although Dante cannot see their faces because they are so bright, he sees that the angels hold flaming swords and that their wings are green.  Dante and Virgil take spots among the spirits for the night.  One spirit, Nino Visconti, recognizes Dante and begs him to ask his daughter to pray for him because his wife no longer cares about him.  Dante notices that three twinkling stars overhead have replaced the constellation of four that he had seen at dawn.  Sordello spots a serpent snaking through the grass but the sound of angels wings, like those of a falcon, scare the serpent away.  Visconti's companion, Conrad Malaspina asks Dante for news from his native land, Val di Magra.  Although Dante has never been to this place, he has heard of it because its rulers are well known.  Conrad prophesies that Dante will visit Val di Magra before ""the sun [has] rested seven times.""
	Purgatorio section 9: As Dante sleeps in the Valley of the Rulers, he dreams of an eagle plucking him from Mount Ida.  He and the eagle soar toward the sun and as they catch fire, Dante awakens from his dream.  Virgil comforts his startled friend by explaining that while he slept St. Lucia carried him up the steep mountain to the gates of Purgatory (until now they had been in Ante-Purgatory).  An angel bearing a sword guards the gates of Purgatory.  Once the angel hears that Dante travels by divine design, he bids the poet to him.  Dante climbs three gleaming stairs: white marble, dark purple, blood-red porphyry.  The angel marks seven P's with his sword on Dante's forehead.  Each P represents a level of Purgatory and will be removed as Dante passes each level.  The angel opens the gates of Purgatory with a silver and a gold key and warns the poets to never look back.  As they enter, Dante hears beautiful voices singing "" Te Deum laudamus.""
	Purgatorio section 10: Dante and Virgil make a difficult climb up a zigzag path to the First Terrace where the Prideful dwell.  Beautiful carvings of scenes depicting acts of humility adorn the marble cliff adjacent to the First Terrace.  The scenes include: the Annunciation, King David dancing before the Ark, and a woman begging Emperor Trajan to avenge her son's death.  A sorrowful group of spirits approaches the poets.  Hunched low to the ground by huge rocks slung about their shoulders, these spirits must contemplate their pride until they have served their appropriate penance.  Dante berates these souls by saying, ""O Christians, arrogant, exhausted, wretched, whose intellects are sick and cannot see, who place your confidence in backward steps, do you not know that we are worms and born to form the angelic butterfly that soars, without defenses, to confront His judgment?""
	Purgatorio section 11: The Prideful spirits recite a long version of the Lord's Prayer.  Moved by their sincere solemnity, Dante believes that the living ought to help these spirits with their prayers.  Virgil asks for directions and one shade, Omberto Aldobrandeschi, responds.  Omberto describes how his unwarranted pride of ancestry caused the downfall of his kinsman and his own death.  Another spirit, belonging to the artist Oderisi of Gubbio, explains how the pride he took in his talents landed him on this Terrace in Purgatory.  Oderisi claims that artists such as him should not strive for fame because their fame is so transient-as an example, he notes how Giotto surpassed Cimabue.  Oderisi identifies one of his companions, the leader Salvani from Siena.  Surprised to see that Salvani bypassed a lengthy stay in Ante-Purgatory, Dante asks how Salvani came to the Terrace so quickly.  Oderisi explains that Salvani performed a momentous act of humility at the height of his power when he begged in the streets to get money for the ransom of a friend.  Salvani's quick ascent into Purgatory shows that great acts of humility can mitigate late repentance.

Purgatorio section 12: Still on the First Terrace, Virgil urges Dante to hurry because he has been keeping pace with Oderisi who walks stooped low to the ground.  Virgil also points out the scenes of pride carved into the ground so that the stooped spirits will contemplate the consequences of pride as they walk.  The first scene depicts Satan's fall from Heaven.  Twelve scenes alternating between Biblical and classical mythology follow: Briareus, the Giants, Nimrod, Niobe, Saul, Arachne, Rehoboam, Eriphyle, Sennacherib, Cyrus, Holofernes, and Troy.  As Dante and Virgil begin their ascent from the First Terrace, an angel brushes Dante's forehead with its wing.  Dante finds the climb out of the Terrace easy and Virgil tells him that because the angel erased one of the P's from Dante's brow, the climb has become easier.  Dante compares the stairway that he and Virgil now mount with the stairway that leads to the church of San Miniato on the hilltop overlooking Florence.
	Purgatorio section 13: Dante and Virgil emerge on the Second Terrace where the Envious serve their penance in Purgatory.  Although the ledge seems deserted, Dante hears voices singing the praises of fraternal love-the opposite of envy.  The first voice sings ""Vinum non habent"" (the words of Mary's appeal to Christ when the wine ran out at the wedding feast in Cana).  The second voice: ""I am Orestes"" (the words Pylades said to pretend to be his friend so that he, rather than the real Orestes, would be killed).  The third voice: ""Love those by whom you have been hurt."" Virgil directs Dante's attention to a group of spirits seated against the wall.  Nearly indistinguishable from the rock, these spirits wear haircloth cloaks that are the same color as the rocks and lean against each other like beggars.  Envious souls, these shades spend their time in Purgatory weeping because their eyes are sewn shut.  Dante meets Sapia, a woman from Siena who took pleasure in the misfortunes of others.  Sapia tells her story and asks Dante to pray for her when he returns to Earth.
	Purgatorio section 14: Curious about his conversation with Sapia, two other spirits, Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli, approach Dante and ask him who he is and where he is from.  Dante responds that he is from a town on the banks of the river that begins in Mount Falterona.  Guido realizes that Dante speaks of the river Arno and that Dante hasn't mentioned it by name because he is ashamed of his hometown.  The shade responds by delivering a blistering speech against the people that live along the Arno.  Guido compares the people from the upper regions of the Arno to the lower regions as follows: hogs, curs, dogs, and wolves.  Guido prophesies that his grandson will someday slaughter the people that live in the region of wolves.  Guido reveals that in life he was envious of anyone who appeared to be happy.  Finally, Guido laments the moral downfall of his Rinieri's descendants and the moral degradation of the Romagna region.  Moving away from these envious spirits, Dante hears voices singing examples of envy.  Virgil instructs Dante that these words should remind men of the glories of Heaven but instead Satan tempts humans to think only of life on Earth.
	Purgatorio section 15: A strong light forces Dante to cover his face.  The light, however, persists and Virgil reminds Dante that his mortal senses are powerless against the approach of an angel.  The angel arrives and directs the travelers to the next terrace where the Wrathful reside.  As the poets leave the Envious, they hear the Fifth Beatitude, ""Beati misericordes"" (Blessed are the merciful).  Dante asks Virgil to explain this remark made by Guido when they were on the last terrace: ""Sharing cannot have a part."" Virgil explains that the value of material possessions decrease with sharing while the value of spiritual possessions increases with sharing-God pours out more love to everyone as more souls love Him.  A fuller explanation, Virgil concludes, will come from Beatrice.  As they reach the next terrace, Dante experiences several ecstatic visions in which he sees examples of virtue opposite the sin of wrath.  In the first vision, Dante sees a mother treating her son gently after she finds him amidst a crowded temple.  In the second vision, Dante sees a mother beg her husband to punish a boy who has embraced their daughter.  The father calms his wife by saying, ""What shall we do to one who'd injured us if one who loves us earns our condemnation?"" In his third vision, Dante sees a crowd stoning a man and shouting ""Kill!"" As the victim falls dead to the ground he prays to God to forgive his attackers.  Dante regains consciousness after the visions and Virgil reminds him that these visions are meant to deter him from wrath.  As the travelers eagerly continue their journey, a smoky cloud emerges before them.
	Purgatorio section 16: The cloud of smoke burns Dante's eyes and irritates his skin.  Although Dante cannot see anything in the murky smoke he can hear the Wrathful souls asking for forgiveness and praying to God for peace by chanting ""Angnus Dei."" Hearing Dante and Virgil in conversation, the spirit of Marco Lombardo approaches and consents to guide the poets along this terrace.  Dante asks Marco about the cause of human corruption, ""The world indeed has been stripped utterly of every virtue; as you said to me, it cloaks-and is cloaked by-perversity.  Some place the cause in Heaven, some, below; but I beseech you to define the cause, that, seeing it, I may show it to others."" Marco responds that while some corruption can be blamed on the stars, men must take responsibility for their actions.  Men understand good and evil and have the free will to choose their path in life.  Thus, men must be held accountable for both their good and bad deeds.  Marco explains that men, born innocent and inexperienced, need guidance from their rulers through laws.  Rome once had two rulers-one that governed spiritual life while the other governed political life.  Marco blames the present state of moral decay in Italy on the fact that only one ruler governs both spheres of life.  Marco names three men who embody examples of ancient virtue: Currado da Palazzo, Gherardo, and Guido da Castello.

Purgatorio section 17: The poets emerge from the smoky cloud near sunset.  Again, Dante receives visions of wrath: Procne (who killed her son), the execution of Haman, and Lavinia (who discovered the body of her mother who had hanged herself).  After the visions pass, an angel beckons Dante to mount the stairs to the Fourth Terrace where the Slothful reside.  The angel brushes another P from Dante's forehead.  As Dante climbs the stairs he hears the Seventh Beatitude, ""Beati pacifici"" (Blessed are the peacemakers).  Night has fallen when the travelers reach the next level so the two rest.  To pass the time, Virgil outlines the design of Purgatory.  Virgil explains that all action, good and evil, stems from some form of love.  There are two forms of love, instinctual love and chosen love (love that stems from one's mind).  Natural (instinctual) love is perfect in the eyes of God but chosen love emerges from man's free will and is, therefore, prone to error.  Love that aims to hurt others takes form in pride, envy, and wrath-the sins found on the first three terraces.  Love directed toward a worthy end but with insufficient zeal, sloth, is punished on the Fourth Terrace.  The three upper terraces punish sinners who loved earthly objects excessively.  Virgil does not reveal the sins punished on the three upper terraces.
	Purgatorio section 18: Virgil continues his discussion of love and free will: ""The soul, which is created quick to love, responds to everything that pleases, just as soon as beauty wakens it to act.Then, just as flames ascend because the form of fire was fashioned to fly upward, toward the stuff of its own sphere, where it lasts longest, so does the soul, when seized, move into longing, a motion of the spirit, never resting till the beloved thing has made it joyous."" However, while instinctual love is natural, like the flames of a fire, men exert free will.  Free will can pervert natural love and men are judged by their acts of free will.  Virgil states, ""Now that all other longings may conform to this first will [instinctual love], there is in you, inborn, the power that counsels [free will], keeper of the threshold of your assent: this principle on which your merit may be judged, for it garners and winnows good and evil longings."" As Virgil concludes his explanation, the poets hear a group of spirits approach.  In great haste, the spirits recite examples of zeal (the opposite of their own sin, sloth) as they hurry by.  Virgil asks the souls for directions to the next terrace as Dante falls asleep.
	Purgatorio section 19: In a dream, Dante encounters a Siren that sings to him sweetly and tries to tempt him as she tempted Ulysses.  Virgil rips the clothes off of the Siren to expose her ugliness and corruption.  Startled, Dante awakens from his dream as an angel approaches to lead the poets to the next level.  The angel pronounces the Third Beatitude, ""Qui lugent"" ([Blessed are] those who mourn).  As they climb to the next plain, Virgil explains to Dante that the Siren caused the sins of those who reside above on the mountain.  To guard against the Siren's seductions, men must ""fasten [their] eyes upon the lure that's spun by the eternal King"" (men must keep their eyes on Heaven).  On the Fifth Terrace-reserved for the Avaricious and the Prodigal, Dante finds numerous spirits lying face down on the ground singing ""Adhesit pavimento anima mea"" (My soul has adhered to the ground).  Dante questions a nearby spirit who explains that he was avaricious (he loved earthly possessions) until he became a pope.  Since he did not turn his eyes toward Heaven until late in life, he must spend his time in Purgatory groveling for penance face down in the dirt.  Dante bows out of respect for this former pope but the spirit admonishes him to stand because in the spirit world everyone is an equal servant of God. 
	Purgatorio section 20: Dante and Virgil stay close to the wall as they move along this terrace because so many souls crowd the ground.  Dante calls avarice a ""she-wolf"" which has claimed the most souls of any sin.  Dante hears a voice citing the poverty of Mary as an example of virtue opposite avarice.  The voice continues by citing two more examples: Fabricius, a Roman counsel who rejected a bribe, and St. Nicholas, who saved his sisters from degradation by earning dowries for them.  Dante finds the spirit whose voice he just heard and learns that it belongs to Hugh Capet, the founder of a grand French dynasty.  In a long and specific list of the crimes committed by French royalty, Capet denounces the sins of his children and kinsmen and prophesies future treachery.  Capet tells Dante that the penitents on this ledge recite examples of poverty and generosity during the day and decry examples of avarice during the night.  Capet gives several examples of Avarice: Pygmalion, Midas, and Heliodorus.  As the poets leave Capet, Dante feels a tremendous earthquake.  The spirits cry ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" then continue their recitals with more zeal than before.
	Purgatorio section 21: Still on the Fifth Terrace, Dante dwells on the source of the earthquake that he just experienced.  A spirit approaches the travelers from behind and demands to know whey Dante has come to Purgatory.  Virgil explains that their journey was designed in Heaven and that although he is consigned to Limbo, Virgil must act as Dante's guide.  In response to Dante's query about the earthquake, the spirit explains that Purgatory quakes every time a spirit completes its penance and rises to Heaven.  Each time this happens, the remaining spirits praise the Lord.  The spirit, calling himself Statius, claims that the last quake signaled his own deliverance from Purgatory.  Without recognizing Virgil standing before him, Statius remarks that his inspiration in life was the great poet.  Dante reveals the name of his guide and Statius bows down before Virgil in great reverence and awe.

Purgatorio section 22: After brushing another P from Dante's forehead, an angel directs the poets to the next level.  As they move toward the Sixth Terrace where the Gluttonous dwell, Virgil and Statius discuss the Aeneid.  Statius admits that he was so moved by this passage in Virgil's epic poem that he became prodigal: ""Why cannot you, o holy hunger for gold, restrain the appetite of mortals?"" Opposite sins, prodigality and avarice, are punished in the same circle of both Hell and Purgatory.  Virgil asks Statius how he became a Christian.  Again, Statius reveals that a passage in one of Virgil's poems that prophesized the coming of a new faith led Statius to his religion.  However, Statius kept his conversion to Christianity a secret and had to repent for his sloth as well.  Virgil names Roman and Greek poets who reside with him in Limbo: Plautus, Terrence, Antigont, and Ismene.  As the travelers reach the Sixth Terrace, Dante encounters a strange tree that bears sweet fruit and tapers at the bottom rather than the top.  Dante hears voices reciting examples of temperance: Mary, the women of ancient Rome (who only drank water), Daniel (who was granted the power to interpret dreams because he would not eat the king's meat), and John the Baptist who ate only honey and locusts when he lived in the wilderness.
	Purgatorio section 23: Still on the Sixth Terrace, the three poets hear a spirit singing ""Labia mea, Domine"" ([Open] my lips, O Lord [and my mouth will proclaim your praise]).  As the voice sings praises, Dante sees numerous pale spirits hurrying past him.  The spirits appear hollow and emaciated from hunger.  Dante meets an old friend, Forese Donati, a fellow Florentine poet, who explains that the tree and the water the feeds it purify the gluttonous sinners who must spend their time in Purgatory without food and water.  Dante asks Forese to explain how he was able to pass Ante-Purgatory so quickly.  Forese responds that the prayers of his virtuous widow helped him leave Ante-Purgatory early.  His widow, Nella, stands in stark contrast to current Florentine women who are immodest and appear in public with their breasts exposed.  Forese notices Dante's shadow and asks for an explanation.  Dante reminds his friend that he has led a reckless life and that Virgil was sent to rescue him and will be Dante's guide until he meets Beatrice.
	Purgatorio section 24: Forese points out other gluttonous penitents: a pope who loved eels cooked in wine, Ubaldino dalla Pila, Bonafazio, and Marhese, a man who was never satisfied despite his constant drinking.  One of the Gluttons, the poet Bonagiunta, asks Dante if he wrote the poem, ""Ladies who have intelligence of love"" and Dante replies that he writes about love when he is moved by love.  Bonagiunta believes that it is this inspiration that sets Dante apart from other poets.  With the exception of Forese, the spirits that have gathered around the poets disperse.  Dante tells Forese that he hopes to return to the terrace soon because his city has become so corrupt.  Forese prophesizes that the man responsible for the downfall of Florence will be killed violently and descend to Hell shortly.  As Forese bids farewell to his friend, the poets move to another fruit tree.  A voice from within the branches of the tree tell the travelers to keep moving and remember these examples of gluttony: the centaurs who had to fight Theseus when they were drunk, and the soldiers who were rejected by Gideon for being drunk.  The angel of temperance descends and erases another Pfrom Dante's forehead.  Glowing like molten glass, the angel directs the poets to the next level as it recites the last part of the Fourth Beatitude: ""Blessed are those whom grace illumines so, that, in their breasts, the love of taste does not awake too much desire-whose hungering is always in just measure.""
	Purgatorio section 25: Statius, Dante, and Virgil climb the stairs to the Seventh (and final) Terrace where the Lustful serve their penance.  As they travel, Dante asks Virgil to explain how shades can suffer from hunger when their bodies are made of air and, therefore, have no need for food.  Virgil cites the example of Meleager, who starved because of a prophecy of the Fates, to suggest that Dante consider supernatural phenomenon as the explanation.  Virgil then turns to Statius for a more detailed response to Dante's question.  Based on a medieval understanding of reproduction, Statius' answer begins with the act of procreation.  Statius explains that refined blood passes from man to woman and creates a human being.  The fetus (although he does not use this term) goes through three stages of development: vegetative, sensitive, and intellective.  God creates the complete soul by endowing babies with the intellective faculty at birth.  At death, the soul leaves the body but retains its intellect, memory, and will.  When the soul reaches either Acheron (entrance to Hell) or Tiber (entrance to Purgatory) the soul assumes a body without mass that takes attributes of its former body.  The shades, therefore, see, hear, speak, and weep.  The poets reach the Seventh Terrace and find a river of fire.  Voices from within the flames chant ""Summae Deus clementiae"" (O God of supreme clemency).  After each hymn, spirits recite examples of chastity such as Mary's words during the Annunciation, and the banishment of Helice from the woods of Diana.  The shades also list names of men and women who were chaste during their lifetimes.
	Purgatorio section 26: Dante's shadow attracts the spirits' attention.  As Dante begins to explain his situation, two groups of spirits moving in opposite directions pass each other.  As they pass, the shades greet one another with quick kisses and one group shouts ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" while the other group cries that Pasiphae has turned into a cow to attract a bull.  Once the groups pass, the first group resumes its hymn-chanting.  Dante explains that he still lives as a mortal and asks the spirits to identify themselves.  One spirit reveals that the souls in the group yelling ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" were guilty of the unnatural vices for which Caesar was called ""queen"" while the other souls in the other group were guilty of natural lust.  The spirit identifies itself as Guido Guinizelli.  Dante expresses his admiration for Guido who he considered a preeminent writer of love poetry.  Guido, however points to another spirit, that of Arnaut Daniel, writhing in the flames as a better poet than himself.  Dante greets Arnaut who responds in the Provencal language.

Purgatorio section 27: As the angel of chastity descends to greet the poet it sings ""Beati mundo corde"" (Blessed are the pure in heart).  The angel urges the travelers to cross through the river of fire because there is no other way up the mountain to the Earthly Paradise.  Terrified that he will be burned alive, Dante at first refuses to enter the flames.  Virgil, however, encourages Dante by reminding him that Beatrice waits for him above.  At the mention of Beatrice, Dante enters the river and writhes in pain from the incredible heat.  Angelic voices urge the poets out of the flames.  Darkness falls as the poets, safe from the fire, lie down on the steps to rest until daybreak.  In his dream, Dante sees Leah who, picking flowers, tells Dante that she prefers to spend her time weaving her flowers into garlands while her sister, Rachel, prefers to look at her own beautiful eyes in a mirror.  After Dante awakens, the three poets resume their climb.  Although Dante will soon attain true happiness, Virgil explains that he has brought Dante as far as he can as his teacher.  Virgil states that having passed through Hell and Purgatory, Dante can now be his own guide.  Virgil's final words to his pupil: ""I crown and miter you over yourself.""
	Purgatorio section 28: Dante and Statius enter the divine forest of the Earthly Paradise.  Sweet odors, soft breezes, and chirping birds fill the air as Dante approaches a lovely stream followed by the spirits of the ancient poets.  Dante spies a beautiful woman picking flowers and singing across the river.  The lady nears the stream and Dante muses, ""No sooner had she reached the point where that fair river's waves could barely bathe the grass, than she gave me this gift: lifting her eyes.  I do not think a light so bright had shone beneath the lids of Venus when her son pierced her in extraordinary fashion."" The lady, Matilda, tells Dante that she will answer any questions that puzzle him.  Dante asks her to explain how breezes and flowing streams exist in this place.  Matilda replies that the breezes in the Earthly Paradise are created by motions of Heaven which always flow in the same direction.  A fountain created by the will of God feeds two streams: Lethe, and Eunoe.  Matilda concludes by instructing Dante to remember that the poets of the Golden Age had an understanding of this region where man first lived in innocence.
	Purgatorio section 29: Matilda resumes her singing as she moves along the banks of Lethe.  Dante keeps pace with her until they come to a sharp bend in the river.  Matilda stops and urges Dante, ""My brother, look and listen."" A great light sweeps across the forest as Dante hears music so lovely that it causes him to regret Eve having caused the casting out of humankind from Eden.  Dante invokes the Muses to help him describe this experience because he struggles to put his sentiments into words.  Dante sees seven lighted candlesticks in the distance.  Followed by twenty-four elders crowned in white lilies, the candles move slowly forward.  Four creatures each with six wings covered with eyes follow the elders.  With a head of gold and a body of red and white, a gryphon pulls a chariot amidst the four beasts.  Three ladies, red, green, and white, dance at one of the chariot's wheels while four ladies dressed in purple dance at the other wheel.  Two old men, one a physician and the other carrying a sword, follow the chariot while four humble men follow them.  Finally, one figure trails brings up the rear of the procession.  The procession halts at the sound of thunder.
	Purgatorio section 30: As the procession halts, the elders cry ""Veni, sponsa, de Libano"" (Come bride from Lebanon) and a group of angels drop flowers over the chariot as they sing ""Benedictus qui venis"" (Blessed are you who come).  A lady crowed with an olive garland and wearing a white veil emerges from the mist.  Dante recognizes Beatrice at once even though he cannot see her face.  Dante turns to express his happiness to Virgil but finds that his teacher has left.  Dante begins to weep but Beatrice tells him that he will soon weep for a different sorrow.  Beatrice tells the angels about Dante's sinful ways.  Dante recoils in shame.  Beatrice explains that although Dante has great talent and loved her faithfully while she was alive, he has strayed from God's plan after her death.  Although she tried to save him from Heaven, Beatrice realized that she had to bring him on this journey so that he could see the torment and torture of lost souls for himself so she went to Limbo to beseech Virgil to be Dante's guide. 
	Purgatorio section 31: Beatrice asks Dante if her accusations are true, ""tell, tell if this is true; for your confession must be entwined with such self-accusation."" Fraught with shame, Dante responds affirmatively.  Beatrice urges Dante to reveal the pitfalls that made him stray from his virtuous path.  Dante tries to explain that after Beatrice's death, he took pleasure in earthly vanities.  After this confession, Beatrice tells Dante that his memory of her should keep him from ever straying again.  Still hanging his head in deep shame, Dante stands across the river from Beatrice as she asks him to lift his eyes to gaze up her immortal beauty-something that will cause him more suffering.  Dante realizes that, even through her veil, Beatrice is ""seemed to surpass her former self in beauty as, here on Earth, she had surpassed all others."" Overcome with remorse, Dante faints.  As he revives, Dante finds Matilda standing over him.  Matilda leads Dante across Lethe where he can wash away his sins.  On the opposite shore of the river, the four women in purple greet Dante and usher him to Beatrice.  The three other dancing ladies urge Beatrice to raise her veil and look upon the poet who has traveled so far.  Beatrice raises her veil and Dante cannot find words to describe his experience thereafter.

Purgatorio section 32: Transfixed by Beatrice's gaze, Dante emerges from his trance only by the dancing ladies.  Dante compares his vision to that of a person who has looked directly at the sun.  As the procession begins to move again, Dante and Statius take positions with Matilda at the wheel of the chariot.  The marchers circle a tree and, after Beatrice steps to the ground, they connect the chariot to the tree.  Bursts of beautiful blossoms spring from the tree.  As the marchers begin to sing a hymn, Dante falls asleep under the tree.  When he awakens, Dante finds himself alone with Beatrice and her maids.  Guarding the chariot, Beatrice tells Dante to watch what is about to happen with care and to write about it when he returns to Earth.  An eagle emerges from the sky and attacks the tree, dropping feathers on the chariot.  Beatrice scares off a fox that tries to enter the chariot then a dragon emerges from the ground and breaks the chariot.  Feathers cover the remains of the chariot that sprouts seven horned heads.  A whore takes a seat upon the chariot then a giant joins her.  The giant kisses the harlot passionately but then beats her when he sees her attention turn to Dante.  Angrily, the giant pulls the chariot away and into the woods.
	Purgatorio section 33: Beatrice's maids weep over the destruction of the chariot but Beatrice tells Dante, Matilda, and Statius to follow her.  Dante tells Beatrice that he won't ask her any questions because she already knows what is proper for him to understand.  Beatrice admonishes Dante to dismiss his shame and fear.  Beatrice prophesies that God will instruct an avenger who will slay the whore and the giant.  Beatrice assures Dante that her words will soon become clear.  Dante vows to tell his story with clarity.  Beatrice asks Matilda to lead Dante to the river Eunoe.  As Dante and Statius prepare to enter Heaven, Dante states, ""From that most holy wave I now returned to Beatrice; remade, as new trees are renewed when they bring forth new boughs, I was pure and prepared to climb into the stars.""
	Paradiso section 1: Dante has seen God in all His glory but finds it difficult to articulate his experience as he begins the last of his three canticles on Heaven.  Dante invokes the assistance of Apollo to help him in this task.  The sun stands at high noon during the vernal equinox when Dante and Beatrice make their ascent from Purgatory to Heaven.  Beatrice and Dante turn to look directly into the flaming sun.  Dante can barely endure the brightness as he turns to face Beatrice.  As he gazes upon his beloved he becomes ""transhumanized""-he loses his physical body.  Upon reaching the Sphere of Fire, wonderful music and extreme brightness surround the travelers.  Beatrice explains that Dante's soul moved toward God so quickly because everything has a natural tendency to return to the point from which it came. 
	Paradiso section 2: Using a nautical metaphor, Dante advises his readers to follow him closely on this journey through Heaven.  Dante and Beatrice arrive in the Sphere of the Moon as quickly as an arrow.  Dante wonders how he can enter the opaque mass that surrounds them in this sphere.  After deliberating on the subject, Dante decides that this phenomenon may help explain Christ's incarnation.  Dante asks Beatrice to explain the cause of the dark spots on the moon.  Beatrice responds by asking Dante to first assert his own theory on the topic.  Dante proposes that the density of the moon varies across the surface.  In refuting Dante's theory, Beatrice raises several detailed and complex counterpoints and proposes an experiment using mirrors to refute Dante's variable density idea.  Instead, Beatrice explains that the energy and light emitted by God travel through the universe uniformly but hit heavenly bodies differently depending on the nature of the mass.  Thus, Beatrice asserts, the differences depend on quality rather than on quantity, as Dante had argued.
	Paradiso section 3: The cloudy faces of seven spirits appear in the haze and motion that they wish to speak with Dante.  One of the spirits identifies herself as Piccarda Donati and explains that God assigned to this realm the spirits, such as inconstant nuns, that broke their vows with God.  However, she continues, all the spirits in Heaven remain content regardless of their position relative to God.  Dante asks the spirits if they ever hope to ascend in Heaven.  Smiling, the spirits reply that they are happy with the station assigned to them through divine love.  Dante learns that although God's grace shines on souls in varying degrees, all souls that enter Heaven feel perfectly blessed.  Piccarda explains that she came to this station because her brother forced her to leave her convent to marry.  Another spirit, Constance, confirms that her story resembles Piccarda's story.  As Piccarda fades into the haze singing Ave Maria, Dante turns to Beatrice whose face has increased in brightness and beauty.

Paradiso section 4: Puzzled by two questions regarding Constance and Piccarda, Dante idles but does not broach the subjects with Beatrice.  Reading his thoughts, Beatrice first addresses Dante's question about whether souls return to the sphere of Heaven from which they were born or if all spirits live in the Empyrean (the highest level).  Beatrice explains that all spirits live in Empyrean but show their faces to Dante in the sphere with which they are associated.  The human intellect, Beatrice states, must perceive spirits in this manner because men need to see things to believe them.  Beatrice concludes her discourse by explaining why Plato was wrong in asserting that spirits return to the stars from which they came.  Next, Beatrice responds to Dante's question about the fairness of blaming people for actions that are forced against them.  Beatrice explains that fault lies in the acceptance of an act rather than in the act itself.  Piccarda and Constance, for example, failed to return to their convents when they were free to do so.  Dante wonders if people can pay for breaking vows by doing good deeds.  Beatrice directs her dazzling gaze on Dante who must turn away because of the brightness of her eyes.
	Paradiso section 5: Beatrice explains that her beauty and brightness increase as they ascend in Heaven because her joy increases.  Beatrice finds joy in Dante's spiritual enlightenment.  Beatrice then responds to Dante's last question by explaining that good deeds can never fully compensate for broken vows because when people break vows they exercise their most precious gift from God, free will, against God.  Additionally, although a vow cannot be withdrawn, the things that one promises can be replaced by other things in the ratio of six (replacement deeds) to four (deeds originally promised).  Beatrice then insists that all Christians must follow both the Old and New Testament when they make vows.  As Dante and Beatrice rocket to the next sphere, Beatrice's increased radiance causes the whole sphere to brighten.  Dante's heart leaps with delight in response to his beloved's beauty.  Dante finds himself amidst a thousand souls.  Dante begs the spirits to tell him who they are and how they came to this sphere.  One spirit begins to glow more brightly as it begins to speak to Dante.
	Paradiso section 6: The spirit addressing Dante here in the Sphere of Mercury belongs to Justinian, a sixth-century emperor.  Best known for codifying Roman law, Justinian dives into a canto-long discussion of the Roman Empire-its history and the symbolism of the eagle.  Some of the historical points raised by Justinian include: the establishment of Troy in Italy by Aeneas, the defeat of Hannibal, several important wars, Augustus, Tiberius, Titus, and Charlemagne.  Justinian concludes by remarking on the evil of those (the Guelphs) who wish to replace the eagle (the symbol of the Roman Empire) with the lilies of France while the Ghibellines hope to claim the eagle as a symbol for their faction alone.  Dante asks Justinian to discuss the nature of the spirits that appear in this sphere.  Justinian responds that these spirits belong to people who were virtuous in life but neglected God because of their desire for fame and honor.  A new spirit identifies himself to Dante as Romeo.  Romeo states that although he served his master well, he was driven to a life in exile by jealous courtiers.
	Paradiso section 7: Still in the Sphere of Mercury, Justinian's spirit rejoins the other lights in the sky.  Confused by an issue raised by Justinian, Dante wishes he could ask Beatrice to answer his questions but refuses to ask her because of her reverence for her.  Beatrice, however, can read Dante's unspoken thoughts so she gladly addresses Dante's question about the nature of vengeance.  Dante wonders why it was just for Titus to destroy Jerusalem if the Crucifixion was just vengeance for the sins of man.  Beatrice reminds Dante of the dual nature of Christ-human and divine.  The Crucifixion of the human side of Jesus was just punishment for the sins of man but the Crucifixion of the divine side of Jesus was a sacrilege.  Thus, the destruction of Jerusalem was just punishment for that sacrilege against God.  Beatrice then responds to Dante's second question about why God chose Crucifixion as the way to redeem man.  Beatrice explains that mankind was perfect when God first created humans but fell from grace because of Adam's sins.  Redemption for these sins could only come through divine mercy and there is no example of greater divine mercy than Christ's sacrifice at the cross.  Finally, Beatrice explains why men are incorruptible.  Her explanation justifies the notion that bodies and souls will be resurrected at Judgment Day.
	Paradiso section 8: Upon seeing Beatrice's beauty grow again, Dante realizes that they have ascended to the Sphere of Venus.  A spirit approaches and identifies himself as a great ruler (Charles Martel) who was loved by Dante.  Martel regrets the downfall of his family at the hands of poor rulers among its ranks.  Happy to see his friend, Dante asks Martel to explain how his brother could be such a poor ruler while his father was so great.  Martel explains that society must have diverse characters such as judges and mechanics.  Differences between father and son are created by God according to a divine scheme and any irregularities in families are due to Providence.  It is bad for society for men to overturn Providence so men who are born to be clergy members must become clergy members while men born to be warriors should become warriors.

Paradiso section 9: Charles Martel prophesies that great ill fortune will befall his family.  A new spirit approaches Dante.  The spirit identifies herself as Cunizza.  Cunizza states that the fame of the spirit next to her will last for five hundred years but she does not identify the nearby spirit.  Cunizza then criticizes the cruelty and mean spiritedness that prevails in her native land, Treviso.  The outspoken Cunizza predicts that her neighbors will soon meet misfortune.  As Cunizza departs, the famous but unnamed spirit steps forward.  The spirit identifies himself as Folco.  Folco reports that although he burned with desires during his lifetime, those memories cause him no pain now.  Folco identifies another nearby spirit as Rahab, the harlot of Jericho.  Despite her sinful life, Rahab earned salvation because she helped Joshua take Jericho.  Folco censures Florence for its corruption but predicts that Rome will soon free itself from the vices that have befallen Florence.
	Paradiso section 10: At this point, Dante urges his readers to think about the perfection of the universal plan.  Dante points out the movements of the sun and of the stars that create the seasons on Earth.  If the revolutions of the sun or of the stars strayed off path then everything on Earth would die.  Suddenly, Dante realizes that he and his guide have entered the Sphere of the Sun, a realm filled with intense brightness.  In that moment, Dante's consuming love for God surpasses his love for Beatrice.  Beatrice and Dante find themselves encircled by a crown of dancing, glorious lights that sing a beautiful melody.  A voice calls out from the crown that he will identify the spirits that surround the poet: Albert of Cologne, himself (St. Thomas Aquinas), Gratian, Peter of Lombard, and several others including Isadore of Seville, and Bede.  The twelve figures again begin to dance around Dante and Beatrice in perfect harmony.
	Paradiso section 11: Dante opens this Canto by musing on the senseless acts of mortals who pursue wealth and power.  How trivial their pursuits seem in comparison to his journey with Beatrice.  The dancing lights stop circling when St. Thomas addresses Dante.  St. Thomas declares that to ensure the union between the Church and Christ, Providence appointed two pious leaders.  The first leader, St. Francis of Assisi, gave up his wealth to devote himself to poverty.  St. Francis attracted disciples who followed their leader by accepting poverty in their hearts and in their behavior-they walked barefoot and wore ragged clothing.  St. Francis preached Christianity in Egypt and received the stigmata before he died.  The second leader, St. Thomas instructs, was St. Dominic who instructed his followers in humility and service to God. Many of Dominic's followers, however, became greedy and now few people in the Dominican order remain faithful to St. Dominic's guidance.
	Paradiso section 12: Still in the Sphere of the Sun, Dante notices a new ring of spirits encircle the first ring.  The two rings sing and move in harmony.  A voice from the second circle tells Dante that he too must extol the virtues of St. Dominic because St. Dominic and St. Francis were appointed by Christ to lead Christians back to God.  The spirit then goes on to detail the life story of St. Dominic.  Dominic was born in Calahorra where his mother had a prophetic dream about his greatness before he was born.  Dominic became a great teacher and traveled great distances to preach his message.  Dominic appealed to papal authority so that he could fight heretics.  The spirit then turns to a discussion of St. Francis.  He laments that factions within the Franciscan order are causing division.  The speaker finally identifies himself as the Franciscan, Bonaventura, then names all twelve spirits in the second circle.
	Paradiso section 13: Dante asks his reader to imagine the astronomical delights that surround him.  We are asked to think of the twenty-four brightest stars that we know arranged in a double crown.  The crowns circle in opposite directions as they sing about the glories of God and the dual nature of Christ.  St. Thomas Aquinas reads the question about the wisdom of Solomon lingering in Dante's mind.  Dante believes that both Adam and Christ had perfect wisdom so they should be placed above Solomon.  St. Thomas explains that one cannot compare Adam and Christ to Solomon because they were created directly by God while a minister of God created Solomon.  Solomon's wisdom, therefore, must be compared to the wisdom of other human rulers.  St. Thomas admonishes Dante for coming to an uniformed conclusion and cites incorrect philosophers and sacrilegious teachers as examples people who did not practice sound judgment.

Paradiso section 14: Beatrice asks the spirits to explain whether or not the spirits will retain their radiance after Resurrection when they rejoin their bodies.  The spirits sing a hymn to the Trinity three times then the voice belonging to Solomon responds.  According to Solomon, spirits will retain their radiance because it is an expression of their inner joy.  All bodily organs will develop the strength to withstand the extreme brilliance.  When body and soul meet again at Resurrection, the spirit will attain infinite and perfect glory.  A third crown surrounds the inner two and intensifies the brilliant light surrounding Dante.  The poet must look away to avoid blinding himself.  Beatrice comforts Dante and when he raises his eyes again, he realizes that they have entered the Sphere of Mars.  Dante observes two beams of light that intersect to form a cross.  Radiant spirits perform an intricate dance while they sing something that Dante cannot comprehend within the light beams.  Overcome with joy, Dante states that this experience surpasses all of the pleasures he has known.  However, Dante does make it clear that he had not yet viewed the beauty of Beatrice since they had ascended to the new sphere.
	Paradiso section 15: The music in the Sphere of Mars stops abruptly as the light of a spirit blazes down from the cross to approach Dante.  The cordial spirit expresses his delight at seeing his blood relative. Dante's ancestor speaks about issues too profound for Dante's comprehension then urges Dante to voice his questions.  Dante expresses his gratitude for the spirit's cordial greeting and asks him to identify himself.  The spirit is Cacciaguida, Dante's great-great-grandfather and the father of Alighiero, the family namesake.  Cacciaguida explains that when he lived in Florence the city was modest and honorable.  He was baptized in Florence and went on to serve Emperor Conrad II on a crusade.  He died in battle as a martyr.
	Paradiso section 16: Through his conversation with Cacciaguida, Dante realizes that ancestors must continually strengthen and bring honor to their bloodline if they hope to maintain the nobility of their blood.  Dante urges his great-great-grandfather to tell him when he was born and to identify the other families that lived in Florence during his time.  Cacciaguida indicates that he was born around 1100 A.D.  Cacciaguida, however, does not want to enumerate on the lives of his contemporaries.  Instead, he tells Dante that had the Church not fought against the Empire then Florence would not have captured towns in Tuscany from which refugees flooded into Florence.  In conclusion, Dante's elder lists numerous families that were thought to be noble during his time but have lost their strength now.  For some of the families, Cacciaguida notes the reason for their fall from grace.
	Paradiso section 17: Dante asks his forefather to tell him what his future holds.  Cacciaguida tells Dante that although God sees the future, He does not interfere with man's free will.  Dante's great-great-grandfather then tells Dante that his exile from Florence will be the result of a plot concerning the pope.  Cacciaguida prophesies the trials and tribulations that Dante will face in exile-that he will break from his fellow exiles, that he will find refuge with della Scala of Verona, and that he will meet Can Grande della Scala who will perform great deeds that relate to Dante.  Dante asks his elder if he should report what he has learned when he returns to Earth. Cacciaguida urges Dante to reveal all that he has learned even if it hurts or angers people.  Cacciaguida reminds Dante to be fearless and to let his poetic mission be his guide.
	Paradiso section 18: Dante turns to Beatrice while Cacciaguida concentrates on his own reflections.  Overcome by his beloved's radiant beauty, Dante doubts that he can properly describe the love that he feels from her.  Beatrice prompts Dante to turn his attention back to Cacciaguida when the elder's expression seems to change.  Cacciaguida decides to reveal the names of other spirits that dwell in the cross from which he came: Joshua, Judas Maccabaeus, Charlemagne, Roland, William of Orange, Renouard, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Robert Guiscard.  As Cacciaguida names each heroic soldier, the corresponding light in the cross shines with greater brilliance.  As Dante observes Beatrice's increasing beauty, he realizes that they have moved to the Sphere of Jupiter.  The souls in this realm wheel through the air like birds, flying in formation to spell a message: ""Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terram"" (Love justice, o you who judge the Earth).  Only the 'M' remains as the spirits fly away and rejoin the 'M' to form first a lily then an eagle.  Dante prays to understand earthly justice through divine justice then he denounces the papacy, specifically indicting Pope John XXII.

Paradiso section 19: Still in the Sphere of Jupiter, the spirits forming the emblem of the eagle speak to Dante in unison.  The eagle symbol states that it left piety and justice on Earth.  When Dante asks for clarification, the spirits state that divine justice is so complex that not even Lucifer could understand it.  Man, therefore, cannot hope to comprehend divine justice.  Dante wonders how it is just that a man in India who has never heard of Christ could be denied a spot in Heaven.  The eagle retorts that men can only accept the authority of the Scriptures to understand such issues. However, the eagle also explains that some non-Christians will find themselves closer to God on Judgment Day than will Christians who committed horrible sins.  The eagle concludes by berating evil rulers.
	Paradiso section 20: The spirits in the Sphere of Jupiter sing a glorious song then turn back to their discourse with Dante.  The eagle reveals that the most honored spirits form the eye of the eagle.  David stands at the very center of the eye while other great heroes such as Emperor Trajan, Hezekiah, Emperor Constantine, William II of Sicily, and Ripheus surround the eye.  The eagle reads Dante's confusion about the fact that two pagans, Trajan and Ripheus, occupy such honored positions.  The eagle explains that St. Gregory pulled Trajan out of Limbo through his prayers and that Ripheus knew about the coming of Christ and, believing in Christ, was baptized by the Christian virtues: faith, love, and hope.  The eagle admonishes mortals for coming to hasty judgments while the souls of Trajan and Ripheus glow with pleasure.
	Paradiso section 21: Beatrice's incredible beauty indicates to Dante that they have ascended to the Sphere of Jupiter.  Dante sees a golden ladder upon which spirits move up and down.  Dante asks one approaching spirit to explain why there is no singing in the sphere.  The spirit responds that Dante's mortal ears cannot hear the singing and that he has descended down the ladder to make Dante happy.  Dante asks why this spirit was nominated to greet him.  The spirit glows and spins with glee because ""Light from the Deity descends on [him]."" However, the spirit cannot fathom why he was chosen to meet Dante and he urges Dante to tell mortals not to bother trying to resolve questions of predestination and other divine mysteries.  The spirit identifies himself as St. Peter Damian and tells his holy story.  St. Peter Damian concludes his discourse with a strong censure of degenerate prelates.  Other spirits descend the ladder and join Damian in a clamorous shout that overcomes Dante.
	Paradiso section 22: Beatrice explains that the thunderous shout of the spirits expresses the admonishment of the clergy for its deterioration.  A brilliant light among the spirits on the ladder speaks to Dante.  The spirit belonging to St. Benedict relates the story of how he founded a Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino.  He then points out two other spirits that devoted their lives to contemplation, St. Maccarius and St. Romualdus.  Dante begs to see Benedict in his physical form and the saint replies that his wish can only be granted when he ascends to the highest level of Heaven.  Benedict then rails against the current monastic life, calling monasteries ""dens of thieves."" Benedict then returns to his fellow spirits who mount the ladder in unison.  Dante and Beatrice follow the saints up the ladder and arrive in the House of Gemini (Dante's own Zodiac sign).  Dante turns to look downward and takes pleasure in how small and insignificant the Earth appears.  After admiring the beautiful planets that circle below him, Dante turns his gaze to Beatrice once again.
	Paradiso section 23: As Beatrice and Dante ascend to the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, Beatrice, her face aflame, gazes expectantly toward Heaven.  As Dante's beloved announces the approach of Christ, Dante notices a great light surrounded by numerous smaller lights in the distance.  At first Dante must lower his eyes from the shocking brilliance but with a smile that sends Dante into ecstasy, Beatrice urges her companion to view the divine scene.  Dante sees the light of Christ rise above him, the Rose (Empyrean) that represents Mary, and the lilies that represent the apostles.  A spinning light, representing Gabriel, circles the Rose and fills the air with sweet hymns devoted to Mary.  Mary follows Christ's light to heights beyond Dante's perception.  As she rises, spirits sing their adoration and call out her name.  In praise of the righteous apostles, Dante exclaims, ""Oh, in those richest coffers, what abundance is garnered up for those who, while below, on earth, were faithful workers when they sowed! Here do they live, delighting in the treasure they earned with tears in Babylonian exile, where they had no concern for gold.  Here, under the high Son of God and Mary, together with the ancient and the new councils, he triumphs in his victory-he who is keeper of the keys of gold.""

Paradiso section 24: Beatrice begs the gathered spirits to help teach Dante.  The spirit belonging to St. Peter detaches from the group and begins to examine Dante on his understanding of faith.  When St. Peter asks, ""What is faith?"" Dante cites Paul and replies, ""faith is the substance of the things we hope for and is the evidence of the things not seen; and this I take to be its quiddity."" Pleased, St. Peter presses Dante to elaborate on the uses of ""substance"" and ""evidence"" in this context.  Dante responds that faith alone supports the belief in the divine ideas and images that have been revealed to him on this journey.  This faith is ""called a substance"" and from this faith man must reason and make deductions that apply to the mortal world.  In this way, faith is also ""called an evidence."" St. Peter accepts Dante's answer and asks the poet how he came to understand these issues.  Dante replies that he learned about faith from the Holy Scriptures.  In conclusion, Dante states his belief in the Trinity.  St. Peter circles Dante three times to express his satisfaction and delight in Dante.
	Paradiso section 25: Dante expresses his hope to return to Florence to be crowned a poet in the Baptistry.  The spirit of St. James approaches and Beatrice asks the apostle to test Dante on the virtue of hope.  St. James asks, ""What is hope?"" Beatrice interrupts Dante before he can respond by telling St. James that there is no man more hopeful than Dante and his journey to Heaven proves such.  In response to St. James' question, Dante states, ""Hope is the certain expectation of future glory; it is the result of God's grace and of merit we have earned.  This light has come to me from many stars; but he who first instilled it in my hear was the chief singer of the Sovereign Guide (the psalms of David)."" Dante goes on to elaborate on the promises of hope as explained in the Bible.  A third light descends and dances joyfully with St. James and St. Peter.  Beatrice explains that this light belongs to St. John.  Following Beatrice's lead, Dante stares at St. John until the light blinds him.  St. John teases Dante as a hush falls over the realm.  Dante turns to Beatrice but cannot see her.
	Paradiso section 26: St. John comforts Dante by reminding him that Beatrice can heal his blindness.  Then, examining the poet on love and charity, the saint asks Dante who inspired him to seek such lofty goals.  Dante replies that he found inspiration in John's gospels, God's words to Moses, and in the writings of Aristotle.  The spirit then asks Dante to explain the force that binds him so closely to God.  Dante confirms that Christ's sacrifice strengthens his love for God and that he loves all of God's creatures.  Beatrice exclaims, ""Holy, holy, holy!"" and restores Dante's sight.  A fourth spirit belonging to Adam greets Dante as he emerges from his blindness.  Adam explains that God did not banish him from the Garden of Eden because he ate the forbidden fruit.  Instead, God sent Adam away because he disobeyed God.  Adam then reveals that he spend thousands of years in Limbo before he ascended to Heaven.  Adam reports that he lived in Eden for only six hours and that the language that was spoken there was lost even before the Tower of Babel.
	Paradiso section 27: ""'Unto the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, glory!'-all Paradise began, so that the sweetness of the singing held me rapt.  Whet I saw seemed to me to be a smile the universe had smile."" Still in the Sphere of Fixed Stars, Dante stands enraptured by the beautiful singing of the blessed.  The light of St. Peter glows brilliantly compared to the lights around him.  St. Peter denounces the modern papacy as degenerate and corrupt.  Of the recent popes, St. Peter states, ""He who on Earth usurps my place, my place, my place that in the sight of God's own Son is vacant now, has made my burial ground a sewer of blood, a sewer of stench, so that the perverse one who fell from Heaven, here above, can find contentment there below."" St. Peter warns that punishment for these sins will soon come and urges Dante to speak out strongly against papal corruption when he returns to Earth.  All of the spirits of the apostles, saints, and prophets ascend into the higher levels of Heaven as Dante gazes upon the Earth below.  Dante turns to Beatrice as they move to the next level, the Primum Mobile.  God's love powers this sphere which in turn controls the movement of all of the lower spheres.  Beatrice points out that time begins in this sphere then she launches into a discourse about how the world has strayed.  Beatrice remarks that men are not evil by nature.  Children, she explains, display innocence and faith but turn vicious as they grow-especially now because no one governs well.  However, Beatrice does believe that the world will find redemption.
	Paradiso section 28: In Beatrice's eyes, Dante sees God in relation to his angels.  When Dante turns from his beloved's eyes, he faces a tiny pinpoint of great brilliance surrounded by nine concentric circles of light.  Beatrice explains that the center light is God and that the surrounding spheres that are closer to God derive more energy than do the spheres farther away.  This pattern does not resemble the planetary system in which the outer spheres move faster.  Beatrice explains that God lives beyond the planetary system and, thus, creates the contradictory phenomenon.  Beatrice identifies the order of angels starting with the sphere closest to God: Seraphim, Cherubim, the Thrones, the Dominations, the Virtues, the Powers, the Principalities, the Archangels, and the Angels.  While all of the angels gaze upward toward God, their powers are channeled down to the appropriate spheres in the universe.  In conclusion, Beatrice reflects that Dionysis, a notable author who discussed angelic order, had been correct in his assertions.

396,Divine Comedy: Novel Summary: Paradiso section 29- Paradiso section 33,"
	 
Paradiso section 29: Reflecting on the center light of God, Beatrice pauses for a moment before she responds to several questions on Dante's mind.  Beatrice explains that God created angels in his own reflection.  God combined pure form and pure matter to create angels.  Thus, St. Jerome's assertion that God produced angels before spirit and matter existed, was incorrect.  After a band of angels was cast out of Heaven, the rest of the angels remained, circling the Heavens forever.  Beatrice censures theologians and preachers who idly speculate about such matters as the nature of angels.  These teachers contemplate divine mysteries at the expense of spreading and teaching the Gospel.  Beatrice concludes her discussion of angels by pointing out that their diversity reflects the diversity of God's love for them: ""The First Light reaches them in ways as many as are the angels to which It conjoins Itself, as It illumines all of them; and this is why (because affection follows the act of knowledge) the intensity of love's sweetness appears unequally.""
	Paradiso section 30: Of Beatrice's growing beauty, Dante writes: ""If that which has been said of her so far were contained within a single praise, it would be much too scant to serve me now.  The loveliness I saw surpassed not only our human measure-and I think that, surely, only its Maker can enjoy it fully."" Again, as Beatrice's beauty increases, she and Dante ascend to the next level of Heaven, the Empyrean.  Beatrice tells Dante that he will see angels and saints in their human form as they will appear at Resurrection.  Momentarily blinded, Dante regains his sight to see a river of light flowing past him.  Sparks fly out of the river and land on the flowers that line the banks.  Beatrice prompts Dante to touch his eyes to the river.  As he touches the light, the river turns into a sea and the sparks of the river transform into the shape of a giant rose.  A thousand tiers form the petals of the rose and a great light shines from the center.  Beatrice points to the few seats in the rose petals that are unfilled, one of which has been reserved for Emperor Henry VII.  Beatrice explains that Henry will attempt to free Italy.  The pope, Clement V, will stop Henry but find his punishment in Hell alongside Boniface VIII.
	Paradiso section 31: Dante describes the angels swarming throughout the great Rose: ""just like a swarm of bees that, at one moment, enters the flowers and, at another, turns back to that labor which yields such sweet savor, descended into that vast flower graced with many petals, then again rose up to the eternal dwelling of its love."" Overcome with joy, Dante quietly gazes upon the fiery faces of the blessed.  However, when Dante turns to question Beatrice, he finds that his beloved no longer stands beside him.  Instead, St. Bernard instructs Dante to turn his attention to the seat in the Rose where Beatrice now sits.  Dante expresses his profound gratitude to Beatrice who turns to him and smiles sweetly.  St. Bernard tells Dante to look at the highest tier to gaze upon Mary who sits enthroned in light and surrounded by thousands of angels that sing joyously.
	Paradiso section 32: St. Bernard explains the arrangement of the tiers of the Rose and points out several notable characters surrounding Mary: Eve, Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and Ruth.  These Old Testament women form a dividing line between Christians who believed in Christ before he was born and those who believed in him after he took human form.  Opposite the line of women, sit the male saints: St. Francis, St. John the Baptist, St. Benedict, and St. Augustine.  Adults occupy the upper tiers of the Rose while infants sit in the bottom tiers.  St. Bernard again asks Dante to gaze upon Mary whose brilliance will prepare him to lay his eyes on Christ.  As Dante turns to Mary the entire assembly of angels sings ""Ave Maria"" with tremendous joy.  St. Bernard points out more important figures gathered around Mary: Adam, Peter, John the Apostle, Moses, St. Anne, and St. Lucy.  Dante's guide instructs him that he must earn Mary's grace before Christ will be revealed to him.
	Paradiso section 33: St. Bernard prays to Mary on Dante's behalf.  St. Bernard beseeches the mother of Christ to grant Dante a vision of God and the power to recount his journey on his return to Earth.  Pleased by St. Bernard's pious words, Mary turns her gaze toward the center light and St. Bernard prompts Dante to follow Mary's lead.  Dante looks up into the light and receives a glorious vision that he cannot fully recount because he has lost memory of it.  He still feels the emotion of the experience but he cannot recall the details of the encounter.  He invokes God to help him recall the scene so that he can tell the world about it.  Dante writes that he gazed into the light until he saw ""substances, accidents, and dispositions"" of the universe bound together by love into a single volume.  Dante reveals that he saw within the Eternal Light, three circles of different colors reflecting each other.  In one of the circles he saw a human face that puzzled him completely.  Finally, a great flash of revelation brought his desires and will into alignment.  The revelation, Dante reports, was caused by God's love, the love ""that moves the sun and the other stars.""

Throughout the man's speech, he addresses a formal audience he calls ""distinguished gentleman""-more out of sarcasm than respect.
	Yet this Underground Man's soliloquy is far from an elegant and polished masterpiece-much of it is confusing and almost incoherent.  The UM himself admits that some of this confusion is a result of his life's confusion-a life that swarms with ""contradictory elements"" that torment him constantly.

	Part 1 Chapter 2: In this chapter we learn that the UM's illness is more than physical: he asserts that he has a psychological disease-he has too much consciousness.  He admits that day after day he would rush home to hide in his ""corner,"" only to anguish and ""gnaw"" at himself, reconsidering the actions he had taken that day.  At the same time, however, he finds a kind of pleasure in the humiliation and even despair caused by this ""overly acute consciousness.""

Part 1 Chapter 3: The UM now uses an analogy to make his point.  He describes the normal, ""stupid"" person as an enraged bull rushing headlong into a wall at the slightest impulse.  He likens himself, one who possesses a hyperconsciousness, to a mouse-the antithesis of a normal man, he says.  While the bull acts on its rather simple mental reasoning, the mouse cannot act because its overly sophisticated mental processes perpetually plague it with doubt and vacillation, rendering him unable to do anything, save ""creep ignominiously back into its mousehole."" This hole, this underground, is the home of the UM and those like him.
	At the end of the chapter, the UM elaborates on the wall concept.  The wall represents, he explains, ""the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science and mathematics."" The wall also embodies such ideas as evolution, which Dostoevsky largely equated with atheism and socialism.  While the man of action readily accepts the wall and its implications, the UM (and Dostoevsky) can't come to grips with the concept of the stone wall, the idea that ""two times two makes four,"" because it makes man out to be an animal-a mere phenomenon of science, lacking the human component of free will.
	Part 1 Chapter 4: To advance his previous point that one can find pleasure in suffering, the UM uses the example of a toothache.  He explains that though there is absolutely no rational motive for finding enjoyment in one's pain, realizing that one can make such an irrational decision is in and of itself a cause for certain satisfaction.

Part 1 Chapter 5: Here we delve deeper into the mind of this deeply disturbed individual.  The UM, explaining what it was like to grow up, says that he could never find any virtue or justice in his world, and therefore could only use spite or conscious deception to find reasons to act.
	Part 1 Chapter 6: Here, the Underground Man sidetracks himself, explaining how if he were a sluggard then he would truly respect himself.  He muses about how his life would be different if only he could call himself a lazy drunk who devoted his life to the ""beautiful and sublime."" In fact, he mentions and quotes the words ""beautiful and sublime"" so often in this chapter that the words quickly become a sardonic attack on the utopian ideals Dostoevsky and his UM so despised.

Part 1 Chapter 7: The UM more clearly focuses his assault on Chernyshevsky's ""golden dreams"" in this chapter, where he asserts that man is an inherently irrational creature (he cites human history, including the American Civil War, which was in progress during the time he was writing), and therefore does not always act in his own self-interest.  Indeed, the Underground Man asks, ""And what if it turns out that man's advantage sometimes not only may, but even must in certain circumstances, consist precisely in his desiring something harmful to himself instead of something advantageous?"" Freedom to act against the laws of nature, against the crystal palace of reason, is the advantage the UM sees above all others.  The UM goes on: ""Man needs only one thing-his own independentdesire, whatever that independence might cost and wherever it might lead.""
	Part 1 Chapter 8: Next, he confronts the counter-argument that man's ""free will"" is just an illusion-just a scientific formula of biological chemicals.  The UM says that if this were ever the case, man would cease being human altogether and become an organ stop.  Later, he even suggests that this liberty of choice, this freedom to be stupid, is a right.

413,Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 9-Part 1 Chapter 10,"Part 1 Chapter 9: Next, the UM uses the analogy of the road to present his conclusion that man is afraid of completing his goal.  Man, he argues, loves the act of building, or constructing the road, but not the final product of the finished road.  It then follows that humans fear the law of determinism-that two and two makes four.  The UM dreads the prospect that humans will find this reason-this crystal palace, because then there will be nothing left for mankind to seek, nothing else for which to strive, nothing else for which to live.
	Part 1 Chapter 10: In this chapter, the Underground Man explains his refusal to accept the crystal palace, for the very reason that he wouldn't be able to stick his tongue out at it.  He would much rather live in his self-acclaimed underground.

Part 1 Chapter 11: The UM begins this chapter by proclaiming: ""The final result, gentlemen, is that it's better to do nothing! Conscious inertia is better! And so, long live the underground!"" Yet quickly he admits that he's lying, that he doesn't truly prefer the underground, but ""something different, altogether different, something that I long for, but I'll never be able to find!""
	He also says that he doesn't believe a word that he has just said, which makes the reader wonder about the man's sanity.  Yet this is all part of the psychology of the underground, and with some personal musings about why he has just written this ""speech"" down on paper, the Underground Man launches into part two-Apropos of Wet Snow.
	Part 2 Chapter 1: The Underground Man flashes back to when he was only twenty-four years old.  He explains that even at that early age (remember the first part was written when he was forty) his life was ""gloomy, disordered, and solitary to the point of savagery."" Speaking about his work environment, he admits that he hated all of his co-workers, though he probably despised himself even more so.  The attack against the man of action in part one is resurrected in this chapter, when the UM explains that ""only asses and their mongrels are brags, and even then, only until they come up against a wall.""
	Though he wishes to interact with others and perhaps even have normal relations with his fellow human beings, the UM's hyperconsciousness, as in part one, makes this impossible.  He spends most of his time reading, hoping it will keep his mind busy working on external problems.
	One night he passes a tavern, only to see some men quarreling and one even being tossed out of the window.  Though he meekly tries to get into a fight himself, hoping to be thrown out in the same way, he isn't successful and leaves the establishment unsatisfied.  But he takes great pains to explain that he left not out of cowardice, but out of vanity.  He wasn't afraid of being physically humiliated, indeed he longed for it.  What he feared was that he wouldn't be understood, that his supreme ""literary"" genius wouldn't be recognized or respected, and that he would be treated as the insignificant little fly that he considers himself.  He remembers the officer who ignored his presence when he tried to start the fight, however.  He stalks this man, finding out all about him, hoping to challenge him to a duel.  Every day he imagines that as the two of them pass each other on the street, he will intentionally bump the man, instead of yielding to him as he always does.  One day the UM finally does find the resolve to carry out his mission, and the two bump shoulders.  Though the officer pretends that he doesn't notice the incident, the UM knows that he does notice, and he declares victory for having ""publicly placed [himself] on an equal social footing with him.""

Part 2 Chapter 2: Dreaming is the only method the UM now finds to escape his life of ""debauchery"" and enter the world of the ""beautiful and sublime."" He says that he dreamt for three months straight, and this dreaming was quite satisfying and even intoxicating, he admits.  He explains that he would go from considering himself to be a hero (in his dreams), to believing himself to be nothing but dirt, shifting from dominating over others to being dominated by them.  In these fantasies, he finds a love for humanity, and soon he wants to exhibit this love in the real world.  So growing restless of this dream-life, he decides to enter society, meaning he plans to visit an old schoolmate named Simonov.
	Part 2 Chapter 3: Visiting Simonov at his apartment, the UM also encounters two of his other former classmates-Ferfichkin and Trudolyubov.  Apparently the men are discussing the party for their friend, Zverkov, for the following evening.  The men completely ignore the UM as he enters, contributing to his notion that he is nothing but an ""ordinary house fly."" Finally after all the preparations have been made, the UM invites himself to their gathering, much to their chagrin.
	That night he has horrible dreams about his childhood school experiences, where he is alienated from his classmates-by conscious choice of course.  These dreams set up an important contrast to the previous ""beautiful and sublime"" dreams he had been having over the previous three months.  Though he had imagined that mankind would embrace him and show him the love he found in his dreams, his overly acute conscious realizes that such fantasies will not be found in the real world, that society will not show him the love he desires.

	The UM is fascinated by her, however, and tries to philosophize to her, rebuking her for making herself into a slave and imploring her to give up the loathsome profession and get married.  Soon he also tells about himself and how he didn't have a family growing up.  This, he says, is why he has become ""so unfeeling."" Eventually he even launches into one of his underground speeches, telling her about selfless love.  Afterward, she crushes him with the sarcastic comment that he sounds ""just like a book.""
	Part 2 Chapter 7: Their conversation continues, and the UM remains very serious with her.  Indeed the whole tone of the Notes has shifted dramatically, becoming much more catastrophic and heartbreaking.  He begins detailing what it will be like when she dies, on old, wretched woman not loved by anyone.  He tells her, ""That'll be the end of your memory on earth; for other women, children will visit their graves, fathers, husbands-but for you-no tears, no sighs; no remembrances.""
	Over the course of the whole conversation, the UM maintains a very pompous, superior tone over this woman.  As in his ""beautiful and sublime"" dreams, he has become the hero before her, the one with all the answers.  Unfortunately, if she ever comes to visit him (since he gave her his address), she will realize that in reality, he is nothing more than a spec of dirt.  This haunts the UM to no end.

	Chapter 2: Mrs. Shelby raised Eliza from girlhood with a good education, which was unusual for a slave.  She was a favorite to the family, and the Shelbys allowed her to marry a handsome Mulatto man on the next plantation named George Harris.  They had a Christian wedding in the Shelby home, and a large celebration.  George's master, Mr. Harris, hired him out to work at a nearby factory.  George invented a machine that helped there, and when his master found out, he became jealous of George's success. He thought that his slave had begun to look better than him, so he pulled him away from the factory and gave him the most grueling farm labor he could find.
	Chapter 3: Eliza's husband George came to the Shelbys to visit her that day, and told her he was fed up with the way his master treated him.  His master said that he should get a wife on his plantation, and since the law did not recognize slave marriages, he could do this.  Eliza was upset, and George told her that he was going to try to runaway to Canada.  If he made it, he intended to buy Eliza and their son Harry.  They said goodbye, and Eliza promised to pray for him because she was extremely pious.

	Chapter 5: That night while preparing for bed, Mrs. Shelby asked why Mr. Haley came to dinner.  Mr. Shelby told his wife that he had business with the man.  Mrs. Shelby then addressed what she and Eliza talked about that day, and Mr. Shelby told her that he had sold Tom and Harry to the man.  Mrs. Shelby was horrified and angry, saying that slavery itself was wrong and that they had promised Tom his freedom. Mr. Shelby told her that it was the only thing he could do because if he did not, they would lose everything.  While the conversation was going on, Eliza was in the closet listening.  She slipped out, and went to her room.  While there, she gathered a few things and her son, and left a note saying that she had to leave.  She thanked Mrs. Shelby for the kind upbringing but she had to try to save her son.  After Eliza left the house, she went to Uncle Tom's cabin, and told him about the sale.  Aunt Chloe told Tom he should go too, but he refused saying that it would be better for everyone else if he was sold because it would save the farm.

	Chapter 18: Miss Ophelia took over management of the house and spent the first few days looking at and rearranging all of the various regions to make them more efficient.  In the kitchen however, the slave Dinnah reigned supreme, and Miss Ophelia had a hard time getting the old servant to change her unsystematic ways.  One day while in the kitchen, an old slave who brought the bread, Prue, came in and the servants in the St. Clare household began to make fun of her for her drinking.  Tom was in the kitchen at the time, and when the woman left, he went to help her carry her basket.  She told him her sad story about losing all of her children either by death or to traders, and Uncle Tom told her the story of Jesus.  After making her rounds one afternoon, Ophelia went to St. Clare and told him her opinions and he said that he expected the servants to be dishonest because of the way they were raised.  He also said that servants as honest and as pious as Tom were rare.  As time went on, St. Clare gave Tom the charge over his money and business matters because the slave was so honest and good.

	Chapter 20: To prove a point to Ophelia about how to raise black children, Augustine brought a young much abused slave girl named Topsy into the household.  St. Clare gave her to Ophelia, and at first, the woman was horrified.  She tried to train her, but to no avail.  The other children adored Topsy, but though she was extremely bright and quick to learn, she plagued anyone who made her angry.  St. Clare thought she was funny, so anytime she got into trouble he would protect her. Ophelia thought that the New England way of raising children was the best through learning to read, sew, and whipping anytime they lied, but none of this worked on Topsy.  One day while the trials with Topsy were going on, St. Clare came upon Eva trying to help Uncle Tom write a letter to his family.  He was touched and offered to write the letter for him. He did so, and by the end of the evening, the letter was mailed. 
	Chapter 21: Back up at the Shelby household in Kentucky, Mrs. Shelby began asking if the family would ever get out of debt enough to redeem Tom.  Mr. Shelby told his wife that she knew nothing about business, and that they would probably never get Tom back.  Aunt Chloe later talked to Mrs. Shelby about hiring herself out in Louisville to a confectioner, and Mrs. Shelby agreed saying that any money that Aunt Chloe made would be put towards redeeming her husband.  Aunt Chloe was extremely happy and grateful and planned to leave the next morning on a boat to Louisville.  She was also happy because living there would bring her closer in distance to her husband.

	Chapter 24: After Alfred and his son left, Eva became very ill.  Finally giving in, St. Clare sent for a doctor and after a few weeks, Eva began feeling better.  Before when everyone thought that Eva was ill, her mother had ignored them, saying that no one cared when SHE did not feel well. When Eva fell truly sick, the only thing Marie could think of was how much it would hurt her to have her daughter die.  She accused her husband of having no feelings for the child, which was entirely untrue, and when Eva did get better, she went to her father for a favor.  She asked him to free all of their slaves so that if something happened to him, they would not go to bad masters.  She also asked that after she died, that Uncle Tom would be freed to go back to his family.  Her father, inspired again by her passionate pleas, agreed.

	Chapter 26: Eva steadily began growing weaker, and one afternoon, she asked her mother to get Miss Ophelia to cut off her curls.  Her father asked her why, and she said to give out to her friends.  When this was done, she called all of the servants to her room and presented each of them with a lock of her hair to remember her by.  Many cried, and she told her father that the rest of her curls were for him.  Topsy who had been trying to be good also got a curl and began to cry, and in her last efforts, Eva tried to get her father to convert to Christianity.  She also expressed the wish that Tom would be freed when she died, and her father complied.  A few more days went by, and then one night at the stroke of midnight, Eva began to die.  Her family including Tom gathered around her, and with a joy of one going to heaven, she died.

	Chapter 29: St. Clare's death brought immense amounts of sadness to his household, not only because he was loved, but also because the servants were afraid.  Marie was a much harsher master with her servants, and proved it when she sent out a slave girl Rosa to be whipped.  Her lawyers came and discussed with her what to do with her property, and she decided to sell most of the land and servants and move back into her brother's house.  Tom during this time went to visit Miss Ophelia and told her of the master's plan to set him free. Miss Ophelia believed him, but when she tried to talk to Marie about the plan, Marie refused.  Tom, along with many of the other slaves, was sent to be sold the following day at a slave auction.

	Chapter 33: While out picking cotton one day, Tom noticed a new woman who appeared to be well bred.  The other slaves disdained her, and she ignored their taunts.  She was very good at picking cotton, and when Tom saw the mulatto woman he had come with falter, he gave her some cotton from his bag.  To replenish the cotton in Tom's bag, Cassy gave him some of hers.  At the end of the day, they went to have their cotton weighed, and all of them came out with enough, but Legree after hearing what was going on, pretended that the mulatto woman was short.  Wanting Tom to eventually become an overseer, he ordered him to flog the woman.  Tom said no, and when threatened, continued to refuse to beat the woman.  Legree turned him over to his overseers for an extremely severe beating.

She fell in love with a gentleman who bought her and they lived as husband and wife for years before the man's cousin came and brought him into debt. The cousin convinced Cassy's love to sell her and her two children to him, and the man agreed without looking back. Cassy hated the man and he sold her children away from her. She was then sold from man to man, and though she had another child, she killed it while it was still a baby so she would not have to deal with the pain of losing it later. Eventually she ended up with Legree and had been with him for five years. She wanted to die, and wished him dead. Tom was saddened by her story, and though she was Christian when she was young, she had completely given up her faith because of her hard life.

She came into the house that evening Tom was beaten and scorned him for his brutality. While they were arguing, Sambo brought in the things that Tom had around his neck. One was the dollar that George had given him, and the other was the lock of Eva's hair. The hair frightened Legree because his mother sent him a lock of her hair the same color when she died. His relationship with his mother haunted him because he had scorned and left her. Since he did not want to be alone, he called up the two black overseers to entertain him.

In the morning, Cassy goes to Legree and tells him that it would be better for his interests to leave Tom alone. Legree agrees with her, but still wants to break the spirit of the pious man. Legree goes to Tom and asks him to beg forgiveness, but Tom will not because he felt he was right. The Tom tells him that he will work for him, but nothing Legree can do will hurt him because of his faith in the Lord.

She describes the hermit-like lifestyle of those like Silas Marner, who she jokes, ""looked like remnants of a disinherited race."" Eliot also addresses the suspicion surrounding these solitary weavers and collectors of herbs, saying, ""all cleverness...was in itself suspicious."" Silas, too, a linen-weaver who had emigrated to Raveloe fifteen years ago, is similarly thought to possess quasi-demonic powers due to his solitary nature and ability to cure others with herbs. To further support the townspeople’s claims that Silas is possessed, the author describes sudden times when the weaver would have ""cataleptic fits,"" in which it seemed his soul had left his body.
	Yet Marner’s whole life hasn’t been spent in this manner. Before he fled to Raveloe, he was a quite normal person, active in his church in Lantern Yard and eagerly awaiting his wedding day. Soon, however, Silas is suspected of having the devil’s influence when he has his cataleptic fits during the church service prayers. Eventually he is set up by William Dane (who he thought was his best friend) and is said to have stolen money from the dying deacon whom he was suppose to watch. Soon his wife-to-be is married to William and Silas is found guilty by the church council following a drawing of lots.

Again, describing those people alienated from society after a traumatic event, like Silas Marner, she asserts, ""the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished, and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories."" Later she addresses the reasons Silas fled to another region of England. She follows, ""In the early ages of the world, we know, it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by its own divinities, so that a man could cross the bordering heights and be out of the reach of his native gods, whose presence was confined to the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from his birth. And poor Silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike the feeling of primitive men, when they fled thus, in dear or in sullenness, from the face of an unpropitious deity.""
	The trust which Silas had previously had in his faith and in the church had now been turned to bitterness. No longer was his faith or personal relations important to him since they had betrayed him. Gold now became the object of his work, and nothing else but weaving his loom day and night in order to get more of this gold mattered. Eliot admits, ""money had stood to him as the symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil... His life had reduced itself to the mere functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an end towards which the functions tended.""

	Eliot describes a positive side effect to this whole situation, saying that Silas, due to his need to communicate with the others in order to get his gold returned, is forced to grow socially. She follows, ""This strangely novel situation of opening his trouble to his Raveloe neighbors, of sitting in the warmth of a hearth not his own, and feeling the presence of faces and voices which were his nearest promise of help, had doubtless its influence on Marner, in spite of his passionate preoccupation with his loss. Our consciousness rarely registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us: there have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the smallest sign of the bud.""
	After pondering for a few moments what to do, several of the men realize that Justice Malam is unavailable and that one of them must be appointed deputy-constable to take the place of the judge. Although there is a ""hot debate"" over this, eventually the men decide that two men will go with Silas to the scene of the crime: Mr. Dowlas and the landlord.

442,Silas Marner: Novel Summary: Chapter 8,"Eliot’s eighth chapter details Godfrey’s state of mind upon his return from the Osgood party. She admits that he is so busy thinking about the beauty of Nancy Lammeter that he doesn’t give much thought to the fact that Dunstan hasn’t returned. He figures his brother has spent the night somewhere else.
	The nest day Bryce, the man with whom Dunstan made the deal with Wildfire, visits Godfrey and tells him about the deal for the horse, the horse’s death, and the disappearance of Dunstan. This outrages Godfrey, who swears revenge. This leaves Godfrey in a difficult situation, since now he has no money to pay off his debts. Though the eldest brother considers lying to the Squire about what happened, eventually he determines that this act would simply get them both into more trouble with their father, so he decides just to speak the truth to the Squire tomorrow.
	As far as the robbery investigation in concerned, the only ""evidence"" found by the deputy constables is a tinder box near Silas’s home, known to be owned by a foreign peddler. Soon many of the townspeople consider this peddler the robber, though they have no real proof.

443,Silas Marner: Novel Summary: Chapter 9,"Chapter nine begins with a description of the Squire. Obviously the man is very proud of his family heritage and concerned about keeping it intact. Eliot continues, ""The Squire had been used to parish homage all his life, used to the pre-supposition that his family, his tankards, and everything that was his, were the oldest and best; and as he never associated with any gentry higher than himself, his opinion was not disturbed by comparison.""
	After the others had eaten, Godfrey finds his father starting his own breakfast, and quickly confronts him about what has happened with Dunstan and the horse. Although the Squire is angry with Godfrey about the debts he owes, the old man saves most of his criticism for Dunstan, saying, ""Let him turn ostler, and keep himself. He shan’t hang on me any more."" Thus, Godfrey has maintained (though barely) his place in the family while Dunstan is forever exiled.

The clue of the tinder-box, though seemingly very important, has now ceased to be a topic of major discussion around the town. Dunstan’s continued absence has also gone virtually unnoticed.
	Eliot describes Silas as a man more confused and desolate than ever, spending most of his time bent over in a chair, holding his head in his hands. She continues, ""The loom was there, and the weaving, and the growing pattern in the cloth; but the bright treasure in the hole under his feet was gone; the prospect of handling and counting it was gone: the evening had no phantasm of delight to still the poor soul’s craving."" Silas is now seen by his neighbors as more crazy than ever.
	Despite the urging of Mr. Macey and Dolly Winthrop to go to church and seek refuge in his faith, Silas ignores these ideas, already disillusioned with the religion he formerly trusted in. Eliot continues, ""And so, notwithstanding the honest persuasions of Mr. Macey and Dolly Winthrop, Silas spent his Christmas-day in loneliness...""

445,Silas Marner: Novel Summary: Chapter 11,"Eliot begins chapter eleven with a characterization of Nancy Lammeter, Godfrey’s love interest. Of course she is beautiful— this is perhaps the most important characteristic, at least as far as Godfrey is concerned. Nancy, however is upset with Godfrey for leading her on. Since she obviously doesn’t know about his secret marriage to Molly, she is naturally very confused at his behavior. Nancy thinks to herself about Godfrey, saying ""...Mr. Godfrey Cass was, sometimes behaving as if he didn’t want to speak to her, and taking no notice of her for weeks and weeks, and then, all of a sudden, almost making love again?""
	The rest of the chapter is devoted to boring scenes in which the ladies dress themselves and gossip about each others’ appearance. Soon the party begins with a dinner, in which Godfrey, acting very awkward, almost melts in Nancy’s presence.

It seems Godfrey will be dealt a crushing blow at his father’s party, when his forgotten wife, Molly, decides to make a surprise visit to confront him and the rest of the Cass household. Eliot narrates, ""This journey on New Year’s Eve was a premeditated act of vengeance which she had kept in her heart ever since Godfrey, in a fit of passion, had told her he would sooner die than acknowledge her as his wife.""
	Molly decides to make the long trip in the bitter cold by foot. Suddenly she becomes very tired and decides to take a rest in a snow bank; she never wakes. Her two-year-old daughter silently crawls out of her dying arms and ventures into the home of Silas Marner where the door is open and a warm fire is crackling. Eliot describes Silas’s shock, saying, ""He leaned forward at last, and stretched forth his hand; but instead of the hard coin with the familiar resisting outline, his fingers encountered soft warm curls...he had a dreamy feeling that this child was somehow a message come to him from the far-off life.""
	Quickly Silas comforts the girl by offering her warm porridge. Soon he looks outside to try to find the place from which she came. It’s at this time he sees her mother’s dead body frozen in the snow.

When the old weaver invites himself in the back door of the party, Godfrey is one of the first people to see him. When Silas begins to speak about the dead woman in the snow, Godfrey immediately realizes that she’s his wife. Eliot details his thoughts, saying, ""Godfrey felt a great throb: there was one terror in his mind at that moment: it was, that the woman might not be dead. That was the evil terror...""
	As the evening progresses it soon becomes obvious that Silas has become attached to his newly found treasure. When the women of the household ask to hold her, Silas protests, saying, ""I can’t part with it, I can’t let it go.""
	Soon a search party is organized to locate the body; Godfrey eagerly goes along to make sure his wife is silenced permanently. He returns home a few hours later, exuberant that Molly is gone for good. Now, he thinks, he will be free to marry Nancy.

Although some of the townspeople think it’s rather odd that a tramp like Silas should raise the toddler, no one prevents the weaver from keeping her, seeing his devotion to her already in his eyes. Whenever Silas is questioned about the situation, he repeats the colloquial phrase, ""The money’s gone I don’t know where, and this is come from I don’t know where.""
	Soon Dolly Winthrop becomes Silas’s child-raising helper and eventual godmother to Eppie. Dolly and her son, Aaron, become the closest contact Silas has with the outside world. Silas’s eyes seem to open more widely with each passing day. The sick obsession he formerly had with his gold has now been replaced with the healthy obsession for his new daughter, Eppie. Eliot narrates, ""Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshiped in close-locked solitude— which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song of birds, and started to no human tones— Eppie was a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her."" She was ""warming him into joy because she had joy.""
	Eventually Silas and Eppie even attend church in Raveloe, something Silas had never had any interest in before, following the bad experience he had with religion in Lantern’s Yard. Soon Eppie is baptized.
	Eliot narrates, ""As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.""

	There are changes to Silas’s lonely stone cottage. There are plenty of pets, both in and out of doors, and more furniture given them by Godfrey. In fact, the Red House has helped Silas and his daughter considerably in the last few years. Eliot explains, ""Godfrey Cass, as everyone said in the village, did very kindly by the weaver; and it was nothing but right a man should be looked on and helped by those who could afford it.""
	By this time, Silas has come to terms with his past, even being willing to share the story of his supposed guilt in Lantern Yard with Dolly. Eliot narrates, ""...with reawakening sensibilities, memory also reawakened, he had begun to ponder over the elements of his old faith, and blend them with his new impressions, till he recovered a consciousness of unity between his past and present.

It seems Dunstan didn’t make it more than a few steps away from Silas’s cottage before he slipped into the water pit in the darkness.
	This find inspires Godfrey to reveal his secret to Nancy once and for all. ""Nancy,"" said Godfrey, slowly, ""when I married you, I hid something from you— something I ought to have told you. That woman Marner found dead in the snow— Eppie’s mother— that wretched woman— was my wife: Eppie is my child.""

	Soon Godfrey gets to the point. He tells Silas and Eppie, ""But I have a claim on you Eppie— the strongest of all claims. It is my duty, Marner, to own Eppie as my child, and provide for her.

The Petersburg surroundings are described as hot, stuffy and crowded, adding to the overall sense of stagnation, sickness and claustrophobia. Raskolnikov himself is suffering from acute depression and loathes the company of other people. He is wearing rags and is brooding obsessively on some unnamed subject (his intended crime) as he plods onward to her apartment. The encounter with the old woman is fraught with anxiety and loathing and it becomes evident that he is casing the place.

Amid periodic scoffs and laughter from fellow patrons, Marmeladov recounts his troubled life, including his dismissal from his job and all the ensuing humiliations and abuse his family has experienced as a result of his alcoholism and their poverty. He describes in particular his proud wife Katherine, who works from dusk till dawn to care for her children and his daughter Sonia, who has taken up prostitution to assist the family. Raskolnikov accompanies him home where he sees the painful and poverty-stricken circumstances his family lives in.

He also receives a letter from his mother. The letter describes how Dunia, who was working as a tutor for the Svidrigailov's, was harassed by Mr. Svidrigailov, who was intent on seducing her. Although she rejected his advances, his wife, Martha Petrovna, misinterpreted a conversation she overheard and blamed Dunia. She then spread vicious rumors about Dunia all over town only to realize later that Dunia was innocent.

While still meditating on the situation, he catches sight of a teenage girl who is staggering in the street, probably drunk. Watching her closely is a predatory man, who seems to be following her.

He dreams that he is a child in his hometown, walking with his father through the streets. He observes a peasant trying to force his old mare to pull a heavy wagon full of people. The horse is struggling beneath the peasant's whip and cannot pull the weight at all. The peasant becomes angry and he beats the animal to death while Raskolnikov watches. The boy becomes so distraught that he tears away from his father and runs to the dead horse, throwing his arms around it and weeping. Raskolnikov wakes shaken and disturbed, asking himself whether he will really murder the old pawnbroker woman with an ax. At this moment, while walking through the Hay Market, Raskolnikov overhears a conversation relaying that Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's step-sister, will be out visiting a peddler and his wife at seven o'clock. The text relates that in later remembrance, the coincidence seemed to Raskolnikov like the hand of fate. In other words, the act that he was formerly torn over committing has been decided by a force outside him. This is interesting, because it clashes with Raskolnikov's concept of the extraordinary man who steps over obstacles and takes fate into his own hands. In other words, Raskolnikov is not the extraordinary man he purports to make allowances for.
	Part1, Chapter 6: The story discusses how Raskolnikov had first visited the pawnbroker. The previous winter, a fellow student had suggested he visit her and although he had not gone then, he had recalled her address six weeks ago. On his first visit he had pawned a ring given to him by his sister. He had felt an insurmountable disgust for the old woman upon seeing her for the first time and on the way home from her house a strange thought began taking shape in his mind. He stopped into a restaurant and happened to overhear a conversation between a young officer and a student which voiced his thoughts. They were arguing, in a philosophical sense, about whether it would be morally wrong to murder the old woman, since she was such a vile and despicable person. They went on to describe how Lizaveta was abused by the pawnbroker. Raskolnikov was shocked to hear his own ideas being discussed. Again, his superstition suggested that this was some kind of sign.
	After recalling this conversation, Raskolnikov lies down for a while and then makes preparations for the murder. He attaches a sling to the inside of his coat, wraps up a phony pledge that the pawnbroker will have to fumble with to untie and goes to the kitchen to get an ax. Unexpectedly, the ax is not in its usual spot and he must take one from the janitor's room. He arrives at the pawnbroker's apartment at seven-thirty.

He then removes her key ring from her pockets and takes a purse that, along with two crosses, hangs on a string around her neck. He leaves the crosses on her chest and goes to search under her bed for a strongbox. While he is looking through the chest, he finds some jewelry and begins to pocket these pieces as well but suddenly there is the sound of someone walking in the room where the body is. He waits for a moment and then suddenly springs up and rushes into the adjoining room where he sees Lizaveta staring in horror.

Sensing that they are headed for the apartment, Raskolnikov latches the door and crouches behind it, waiting. Two men who have appointments approach the door and ring. At first they are annoyed that the occupants have forgotten their appointments, but then they realize that the door is latched from the inside and that something must be wrong. One leaves to get the janitor and the other waits at the door for a while before getting fed up and leaving also. Now that the coast is clear, Raskolnikov slips out the door and hides in a vacant apartment that is being painted. The men approach with the janitor and head for the apartment.

Feeling a sudden rush of relief and joy, he goes into a long explanation of his prior engagement to the landlady's daughter, who died.

Part 3, Chapter 3: Raskolnikov reveals that he gave away the money his mother had sent him, describing the details of Marmeladov's accident and his family's poverty. Raskolnikov's mother mentions that Martha Petrovna, Svidrigailov's wife, has died. There is a rumor that Svidrigailov had beat her and shortly after she had a stroke while bathing. Raskolnikov then reasserts his opposition to Dunia's marrying Luzhin and insists that she must choose between them. He states, Let me be vile. You must not. One's enough. Dunia denies that she is marrying him out of sacrifice, but he does not believe her. They show him the letter from Luzhin and he scoffs at it, and points out that Luzhin is trying to slander him by twisting what actually happened at Marmeladov's. In the end, Dunia informs everyone that she has decided Raskolnikov should accompany them to the meeting after all.
	Part 3, Chapter 4: At that moment, the door opens and Sonia enters, timid, embarrassed and shabbily dressed. Raskolnikov regards her with kindness and pity. He seats her by his sister, despite her low social standing. Sonia is extremely shy and explains that she had come from Katherine Ivanovna to invite him to Marmeladov's funeral and to the dinner afterwards. Katherine had prepared a lavish feast in memory of her husband as well as a testament to the fact that she herself came from better lineage. Pulcheria and Dunia excuse themselves and leave Raskolnikov alone with Sonia. He stares at her for several moments and recalls her father's account of her sacrifice.
	Raskolnikov then tells Razumikhin that he would like him to try and recover Dunia's ring and his father's watch, which he had pawned at the old woman's and which are now in police custody. He explains that he is worried his mother or sister might ask about them. He suggests that it might be better to go straight to Porfiry Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin's and Razumikhin agrees heartily, saying that Porfiry will be very glad to meet him.
	On her way home, Sonia finds a new universe...taking possession of her soul--feelings are growing for Raskolnikov. It is revealed that Svidrigailov had overheard her say Raskolnikov's name as they parted and has been following her since, only to realize that they are neighbors, at which point he greets her. She feels strangely ashamed and more timid in his presence.
	Razumikhin and Raskolnikov proceed to Porfiry's home. On the way, Razumikhin describes Porfiry as a very smart, skeptical man who likes to fool people. Raskolnikov wonders whether Porfiry knows about his visiting the pawnbroker's apartment and asking about the blood. He decides he will have to find out by the expression on Porfiry's face. He then begins to tease Razumikhin about his obvious infatuation for Dunia and Razumikhin becomes annoyed. Raskolnikov continues to taunt him so that they both enter the flat laughing uproariously.

Part 3, Chapter 5: Raskolnikov enters still laughing and unable to restrain himself for several moments, meaning to affect a tone of spontaneous gaiety and confuse any suspicions Porfiry may have. He is surprised to see that Zamiotov, the officer he had met in the tavern the day before, is there. Raskolnikov then explains that he would like to retrieve the pawned items. Porfiry tells him that he must make a formal statement to the police about the matter. Raskolnikov, who is watching Porfiry closely, begins to suspect that he knows. Porfiry then mentions that he has been waiting for him and that the items were found at the pawnbroker's with his name on them, along with the date they were obtained. He goes on to mention an article of Raskolnikov's which has been published recently. Raskolnikov is surprised to hear that it has been published.
	In the article, Raskolnikov discusses his theory of crime and the extraordinary man. He argues that there are some individuals who are above the law. These extraordinary people are extremely rare, and include men like Napoleon, who step over all obstacles in order to achieve a greater goal. In the end, history agrees with them because their works are not subject to common morality and bring about great changes. These men do not suffer the pangs of conscience others are afflicted with. Their will is supreme. Although it is this theory which has allowed him to murder, Raskolnikov falls short of his definition of the extraordinary man. There rages within him a battle between the cold, calculating killer and the humane being capable of love. Thus at one moment, he is able to murder two people and at another abandon himself utterly to compassion, giving the last of his money to a dead man's family. The extraordinary man is entirely driven by his ideology, while Raskolnikov is aware in some ways of his connectedness to other living beings.
	Porfiry asks Raskolnikov to expound more on his theory and asks whether Raskolnikov considered himself one of the extraordinary men when he wrote the article. Raskolnikov answers that it might very well have been. Porfiry then asks whether it wasn't some future Napoleon who finished off the pawnbroker and her sister. Raskolnikov does not reply. Porfiry then tells him to come by with the statement and at that time they will talk. Raskolnikov, feeling annoyed, answers harshly, Do you want to question me officially, with all the formalities? Porfiry denies this, although Raskolnikov does not believe him. Porfiry then casually asks whether Raskolnikov recalls seeing painters at work in the empty apartment when he had brought his pledges. (Of course, the painters were working the day of the murder, not the day he brought his pledges). Raskolnikov, understanding the trap, says that he doesn't recall seeing them but that someone was moving out. Raskolnikov and Razumikhin leave.
	Part 3, Chapter 6: After leaving Porfiry's, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov discuss the conversation. Razumikhin is insulted by the implication that Porfiry and Zamiotov may suspect Raskolnikov of the crime, and admits that he had noticed the idea hatching quite a while ago. When they reach the lodging where Raskolnikov's mother and sister are staying, Raskolnikov excuses himself, saying he has business to attend to. He goes back to his house and searches the hole in the wall where he had originally stored the stolen items. Nothing is there, however, and he leaves. As he reaches the gate, he hears the janitor say, There he is to a man he has never seen before, who is dressed as an artisan. He goes over to the stranger and asks, What is it? The man stares at him closely for a moment then turns slowly away and leaves through the gate. Raskolnikov follows him and the two walk side by side, not saying anything for a moment until Raskolnikov speaks up and asks him why he had been looking for him. The man calls him a murderer and leaves him standing in the street.
	Raskolnikov goes back to his room and lies on the couch, drained and feeling ill again. After a while he hears Razumikhin check in on him and leave. He is distraught, wondering who the strange man could have been and whether he actually saw anything. At this point, he feels contemptuous of his own weakness and thinks that the extraordinary men are made of bronze, not flesh and blood! He laughs at his pitiful attempt to be extraordinary, thinking Would Napoleon sneak up to an old bag like that along her bed? He decides he is a louse, yet continues to burn with hatred for the old woman. He then ponders gentle creatures like Poor Lizaveta and Sonia, and falls asleep with Sonia in his thoughts.
	He dreams that he goes into the old woman's house and strikes her with the ax again, but she does not die, as if she were made of wood. Every time he strikes, the old woman laughs. When Raskolnikov wakes, Svidrigailov is waiting in his room.

Part 4, Chapter 3: Katherine, who is increasingly emotionally unstable, asks Luzhin to come to her aid, citing her father's hospitality to him. He waves her away contemptuously, openly denying that he knew her father. He goes immediately to Sonia and accuses her of stealing a one hundred-ruble note from his room during their meeting. Katherine rushes to her defense, vehemently denying that Sonia would do such a thing. Sonia is frightened and horrified. She responds that she didn't take anything and gives him back the ten-ruble note he had given her. Sonia looks around her in despair and sees the crowd eyeing her with hostility. Raskolnikov is gazing steadily at her. In anger at Luzhin's accusations, Katherine searches Sonia's pockets. In her right pocket she finds a crumpled one hundred-ruble bill. Katherine still does not believe Sonia is guilty. She gives a pathetic plea to the crowd to come to her aid.
	Suddenly, a voice in the doorway says, How lowdown that is! It is Lebeziatnikov, who testifies that he had seen Luzhin slip the bill into Sonia's pocket and had thought at the time it was because he was doing a good deed. Raskolnikov immediately speaks up and spells out a motive, relaying the details of Luzhin's engagement to Dunia and how he had tried to put Raskolnikov in a bad light by slandering Sonia. Luzhin leaves and on his way out, someone in the crowd throws a glass at him but misses and hits the landlady. At this, she evicts Katherine and her family. Raskolnikov goes to follow Sonia, who had fled.
	Part 4, Chapter 4: Sonia exclaims, What would have happened to me if you hadn't been there! Raskolnikov responds by telling her the incident was based on her social position. He then asks if it were for her to decide, who she would choose to remain alive, Katherine or Luzhin. She rebukes him for asking her something that shouldn't be asked. She keeps asking him what is wrong, sensing something horrible. He understands that she loves him, however, and struggles to reveal the truth. He reminds her that he had promised to tell her who had killed Lizaveta and asks her if she can guess. He turns to face her and says, Take a good look. After understanding, Sonia collapses with grief, but then goes to him and holds both his hands. Why, why did you take this upon yourself! she says and throws her arms around his neck. When he tells her she is strange for embracing him after he what he has told her, she says, ...there is nobody...anywhere in the world now unhappier than you! She says she will go with him to Siberia. He responds saying that maybe he does not want to go to Siberia and in that voice she hears the tones of the murderer.
	Raskolnikov offers various explanations for his crime, but settles on I killed for myself, myself alone. Sonia instructs him to rise and go to the crossroads, to bow down and kiss the earth which he has defiled, then bow down to the four points of the compass and say aloud, I have killed. She says, You must accept suffering and redeem yourself by it. Raskolnikov still resists the idea of repentance and confession.  Since Sonia had turned to him with all her heart he was more miserable. She offers him a cross made of Cypress and says she'll wear one of brass that was given to her by Lizaveta. At that moment, there is a knock at the door. It is Lebeziatnikov.

They threw her out and she was threatening to take the children out onto the streets to perform for money. They rush out of the house, Sonia leading.

	The play is set in a city called Ephesus. Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse who has been sentenced to death, is pleading for mercy from Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus. The Duke protests that he cannot act in defiance of the law. He explains that there has been a disagreement between the cities of Syracuse and Ephesus and that if any merchant from either city is found in the other, he must pay a fine of a thousand marks or be executed. Egeon does not have the money and says he is resigned to die, as this will end his ""woes."" The Duke, his curiosity awakened, asks Egeon why he came to Ephesus. Egeon tells the story of his life.

Antipholus of Syracuse (as he is called to distinguish him from his brother Antipholus of Ephesus), left home with his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, who had likewise lost his twin brother (Dromio of Ephesus), to seek for the lost half of his family. Egeon soon followed, searching now for both halves of his family. Eventually he reached Ephesus.
	The Duke is moved by Egeon's story. He tells him that though he cannot alter his sentence, he will postpone the execution for one day to give him time to raise the money to buy his freedom. Egeon feels that his case is hopeless but goes off into the city to try to find the money.
	Analysis
	The first scene introduces the major theme of the play, identity. There are two sets of twins, the Antipholuses and the Dromios. In Shakespeare's day, as today, the intense bond that often exists between twins was recognized. Though twins in close contact can struggle to assert their individual identity, it can also be the case that a twin who is separated from his or her sibling suffers a loss, as if of his or her own identity. It is as if half of them is missing. This feeling of loss drives Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse to leave home to find their 'other halves.'
	In addition to the bond between the twins, identity is also explored through the paternal/filial bond. Egeon loses first his wife and one son, then his other son. He now feels that his life is not worth living. Thus his sense of identity is entirely bound up in his family. The Duke's inclination to give Egeon another chance opens up the possibility of redemption from his wretched and despairing state.

Summary
	The play is set in a city called Ephesus. Egeon, a merchant from Syracuse who has been sentenced to death, is pleading for mercy from Solinus, the Duke of Ephesus. The Duke protests that he cannot act in defiance of the law. He explains that there has been a disagreement between the cities of Syracuse and Ephesus and that if any merchant from either city is found in the other, he must pay a fine of a thousand marks or be executed. Egeon does not have the money and says he is resigned to die, as this will end his ""woes."" The Duke, his curiosity awakened, asks Egeon why he came to Ephesus. Egeon tells the story of his life.
	Egeon says he was born in Syracuse and married. He grew wealthy by trading with the city of Epidamnum. His agent in Epidamnum died, leaving his affairs in disarray. Egeon was forced to travel there to sort things out. His pregnant wife followed him. While staying in an inn in Epidamnum, she gave birth to twin boys. At the same time, and in the same inn, a poor woman also gave birth to twin boys. Egeon bought her boys to bring up as servants to his sons.
	While they were returning to Syracuse, a storm blew up. The sailors took a boat and abandoned ship, leaving Egeon and his family to their fate. Egeon's wife tied herself with one son and one of the servants to a mast to prevent them being swept into the sea. Egeon tied himself, with the other son and the other servant, to another mast. The weather grew calmer and they saw two ships, one from Corinth and the other from Epidaurus, sailing towards them. But before the ships reached them, their own ship hit a rock and split in two. Egeon's wife and one son and servant were picked up by the ship from Corinth. Egeon and the other son and servant were picked up by the Epidaurian ship, but they were unable to catch up with his wife's ship and the family was separated.
	When Egeon's son, the youngest of the twins, reached eighteen, he became curious about his brother, whose name, Antipholus, he had adopted. Antipholus of Syracuse (as he is called to distinguish him from his brother Antipholus of Ephesus), left home with his servant, Dromio of Syracuse, who had likewise lost his twin brother (Dromio of Ephesus), to seek for the lost half of his family. Egeon soon followed, searching now for both halves of his family. Eventually he reached Ephesus.

491,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Act 1 Scene 2
Summary
	Antipholus of Syracuse enters with his servant, Dromio of Syracuse. They do not know that Antipholus's father Egeon is also in Ephesus. The First Merchant advises Antipholus to say he is from Epidamnum rather than from Syracuse, lest he be arrested. Antipholus S. gives a purse of his money (a thousand gold marks) to Dromio of Syracuse and asks him to take it to the Centaur inn where they are staying, while he explores the city. Left alone, Antipholus S. reflects on his unhappiness at failing to find his mother and brother.
	Dromio of Ephesus enters and mistakes Antipholus S. for his master, Antipholus of Ephesus, a wealthy citizen married to Adriana; Antipholus S. mistakes Dromio E. for his servant, Dromio S. This misunderstanding leads to an argument. Dromio E. chides Antipholus S. for being late home for dinner. Antipholus S. asks Dromio E. where he left the money he gave him (in fact, he gave it to Dromio S.). Dromio E. does not know what he is talking about. Antipholus S. slaps Dromio E., who flees. Left alone, Antipholus S. worries that his servant has stolen his money. This does not surprise him as he believes Ephesus to be full of cheats, witches, and sorcerers. He thinks that perhaps one has bewitched his servant. He goes off to the Centaur inn to look for him.
	Analysis
	This scene continues the theme of buying and selling. The First Merchant turns down Antipholus S.'s invitation to walk round the town with him on the grounds that he is meeting some merchants by whom he hopes to make a profit. In Ephesus, it is implied, money is placed above friendship, and the human is subject to the monetary. Thus, Egeon is forced by a law enacted by quarreling merchants to pay a ransom for his life in spite of the Duke's compassion towards him. This value system, where economics are paramount, gained ground in Shakespeare's time and dominates our social system today. While Shakespeare had too universal an outlook to be a didactic or narrowly 'political' writer, he presents the dominant status of economic values along with an uncompromising view of the human cost.
	The theme of identity is movingly developed in Antipholus S.'s soliloquy (lines 33-40), in which he likens himself to a drop of water that has plunged into the ocean to seek another drop, losing his own identity in the process. In his quest for his twin brother, he has lost his family and his homeland and in this scene loses his money and servant. He finds himself in a strange land which he believes to be full of people who trade in lies and illusion, some of whom have the power to change or deform the bodies of their victims - a direct attack on self-identity. This speech helps establish the setting of Ephesus as one of strangeness and enchantment, in which anything can happen.
	Dromio E.'s mystified responses to the man he believes to be his master also have a disorienting effect, since our identity partly depends on the memory of our personality and interactions as held by ourselves and others. Much modern literature has explored the question of who we are, if suddenly one day, nobody else recognizes or knows us. This is the situation in which the two sets of twins find themselves.
	Identity, or sense of self, is explored in many of Shakespeare's plays. Often, the characters are thrown into a situation that robs them of the external props and appendages by which they define their identity. In King Lear, Lear loses his kingly status and corrupt daughters and followers, and wanders naked on a moor; in As You Like It, Rosalind and Duke Senior are exiled from the court and, no longer able to draw upon the support system that surrounds nobles, must fall back on their own resources. Such periods of deprivation and suffering serve as a school in which the characters discover a new and stronger self-identity that is less dependant on such crutches as worldly status and rank. In The Comedy of Errors, the strange city of Ephesus is the place where the characters lose their identity, only to regain it in the final act.

492,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 1,"Act 2 Scene 1
Summary
	Adriana, Antipholus S.'s wife, is worried that her husband and servant are not back. Luciana, her sister, explains that men are masters of their liberty and can go where they like. She says that a dutiful wife must exercise patience. This annoys Adriana, who does not see why women should have less freedom than men. She says Luciana only talks of patience because she has no experience of marriage.
	Dromio E. enters and reports to Adriana what has passed between him and the man he believed to be his master, including the beating he received. He says he has gone mad and talks only of his gold. Adriana angrily sends him again to fetch her husband, threatening Dromio with another beating should he fail once more to bring him home. Dromio reluctantly leaves to look for his master.
	Adriana bitterly reflects that if her husband has lost interest in her, it is his doing: he has ""wasted"" her beauty and attractiveness. She thinks that he is playing around with another woman and that this explains why he has not come home. She says she wants to die. Luciana believes that she is foolishly jealous.
	Analysis
	The confusion caused by the mistaken identities deepens. Adriana, in her anger and jealousy, has already constructed an imaginary reality in which her husband has deserted her for another woman. Like Egeon, she sees no point in living if she has lost her loved one. This highlights the extent to which people lose their own identity in that of the beloved.
	The scene also illustrates Adriana's character and contrasts it with that of her sister Luciana. Adriana is angry, independent-minded and impatient, but loves her husband with an intensity that quickly transforms into jealousy. Luciana puts the more conventional point of view, that a wife should be dutiful, patient and uncomplaining. That Adriana should put her sister's calm attitude down to inexperience shows her cynical view of men, women and relationships.

493,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 2,"Act 2 Scene 2
Summary
	Antipholus S. enters, having been to the Centaur inn, and reports that Dromio has stored his gold safely there. Dromio S. enters. Antipholus S. teases Dromio about the conversation he had with Dromio E. about the gold and the dinner, which naturally Dromio S. does not remember. Dromio S. believes he is joking, and gets another beating from his angry master. Dromio S. manages to soothe his master into a better humor with a long joke about baldness.
	Adriana and Luciana enter. Adriana is annoyed and upset at Antipholus S.'s failure to recognize her. She accuses him of infidelity and of having betrayed his marriage vows. Antipholus S. protests that he has never seen her before, and Dromio S, confirms that he also does not know her, which makes her even angrier. Though Antipholus S. is still baffled, he decides to go along with ""the offer'd fallacy"" (line 186) and go with Adriana to her home. Dromio wonders if he has been transformed into an ape or a donkey, as this would explain why Adriana knows him but he does not know her.
	Antipholus S. arrives at Antipholus E.'s house with Adriana and goes upstairs with her and Luciana to dine. Dromio is left to guard the gate, with instructions from Adriana to let no one in.
	Analysis
	Adriana's enraged speech to Antipholus S., whom she believes to be her adulterous husband (she is mistaken on both counts) takes up the image of the drop of water introduced by Antipholus S. in Act 1, scene 2. She says that husband and wife are as indivisible, just as a drop of water placed into the ocean cannot be retrieved. Her idea of love is not only possessive in the extreme but demands the complete obliteration of all individual identity - a notion that proves as unsustainable in the play as it does in real life. She takes this idea to its logical conclusion, saying that ""if we two be one, and thou play false, / I do digest the poison of thy flesh, / Being strumpeted by thy contagion"" (lines 142-144). In other words, she feels she is as responsible as he is for any sin that he commits.
	The characters' confusion of identity is highlighted by Dromio S.'s jesting query as to whether he has been changed into an ape or an ass. Since both animals carried connotations of foolishness, he is in fact asking if he, and by extension his master, are being made fools of. Antipholus S.'s bewildered question, ""Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell? / Sleeping or waking, mad or well advis'd?"" (lines 212-213) sums up the absence of constant reference points and solid assumptions in this shifting world.
	Antipholus S.'s essential good humor is apparent in this scene. Dromio S. is able to laugh him out of his determination to beat him, and Antipholus cheerfully decides to go along with Adriana's ""offer'd fallacy"" even though he has never seen her before. This shows that he is open to new experiences, an important quality in a comic hero.

494,The Comedy of Errors: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"Act 3 Scene 1
Summary
	Antipholus of Ephesus enters with his servant, Dromio of Ephesus, the goldsmith Angelo and the merchant Balthasar. Antipholus E. asks Angelo to help him placate his wife by telling her that he was delayed at Angelo's shop to oversee the making of the gold chain he intends to give her as a present. He mocks Dromio E. for claiming that he was beaten by his master for misappropriating the thousand marks, saying he must have been drunk.
	Antipholus E. arrives at his house with Dromio E., Angelo and Balthasar. All are expecting dinner, and are unaware that inside the house, dinner is already being eaten by the other Antipholus. They are barred from entering by Dromio S., who is under orders to let no one in. Antipholus E. angrily demands to be let in, but Adriana and the maid Luce (also called Nell - a mistake by Shakespeare) refuse; as far as they are concerned, the master is dining at home and those outside the door are imposters and pranksters. Antipholus E. wants to break down the door, but Balthasar advises him against it, lest it cause a scandal and stain Adriana's reputation. Antipholus E. backs down and suggests that they all dine with a woman friend of his, referred to in the play as the Courtesan (prostitute). She is the hostess of the Porpentine (Porcupine) inn. Antipholous E.'s friendship with her has often caused jealous rages in Adriana. He asks Angelo to bring the chain intended for Adriana to him at the Porpentine inn, so that he can give it to the Courtesan to spite his wife.
	Analysis
	This is our first sight of Antipholus E. and it is hard to judge him as sympathically as we do his twin. Unlike his brother, he cannot be laughed out of a rage by his servant; and his action in giving a chain meant for his wife to the Courtesan is spiteful and petty. However, in his justification, he seems to think that he is shut out of his house because his wife is engaged in some sexual liaison, so he is punishing her supposed infidelity with an adventure of his own.
	Whether Adriana is offering Antipholus S. more than just dinner has been debated by critics. On one hand, her insistence that no one be allowed to disturb them suggests a sexual motive. On the other hand, in the very next scene we see Antipholus S. pursuing Adriana's sister Luciana, which suggests that his attentions were never directed towards Adriana. Indeed, in Act 3, scene 2, he declares that his ""soul"" ""abhor[s]"" Adriana.
	The themes of debt, and buying and selling are explored here in Antipholus E.'s attempt to 'buy off' his wife, who is angry at his absences, with the gold chain he has ordered for her. The gold chain becomes a way of paying off a marital debt he has incurred by his neglect of his wife. When he believes that she has been unfaithful to him, he decides that he this frees him of the obligation: he determines to give the chain to the Courtesan instead. As we see later, the chain is not offered to the Courtesan without obligation, either. Antipholus E. receives a ring from the Courtesan in exchange for the chain. Thus relationships in Ephesus are defined by a chain of debts.

Summary
	Luciana is chiding Antipholus S., whom she believes to be her sister's husband, for wooing her. If he must be unfaithful to Adriana, she says, he should at least pretend he still loves her, be discreet about his affairs, and avoid hurting her. Antipholus S. denies that he is Adriana's husband and declares his interest in Luciana. Luciana runs off in distress to find her sister.
	Dromio S. enters, running away from the kitchen maid, Nell (also called Luce - a mistake by Shakespeare), who is romantically involved with Dromio E. and has mistaken Dromio S. for her husband. He gives his master an unflattering description of her as a fat and sweaty woman, and they laugh together at her expense. Nell was able to describe certain concealed distinguishing marks on Dromio S.'s body, which makes him think she is a witch (he must have the same marks as his twin).
	Antipholus S., unnerved by the fact that everyone in Ephesus appears to know them but that they know no one, concludes that the place is full of witches. He therefore means to leave before nightfall, and asks Dromio S. to go to the harbor to see whether there is a suitable boat for them to take. He confirms that he is repulsed by Adriana, who believes him to be her husband, but attracted to Luciana. However, he trusts nothing and nobody here, so he is resolved to leave her.
	Angelo brings the chain to Antipholus S., believing him to be Antipholus E. Antipholus S. is baffled, saying he never ordered it. Angelo insists that he did, and says he will come to collect his payment at supper-time. Antipholus S. is pleased with his gift and again voices his intention to leave as soon as possible.
	Analysis
	Luciana makes her second speech about right and wrong behavior in marriage. She assumes that men will have affairs but believes that they should behave discreetly and tactfully, pretending to love their wives. This has an ironic undercurrent of self-sabotage, since we know that Antipholus is wooing her for herself, and before they have even started their relationship, she is giving him license to stray.
	Dromio S.'s panic-stricken question to his master, ""Am I your man? Am I myself?"" and his own reply, ""I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and beside myself"" (lines 74-76) highlight the theme of identity in relation to others. Dromio S. has suddenly become the property of a woman he does not know, and this makes him wonder whether he is still himself or has mysteriously been transformed. His comic horror-struck bafflement contrasts with Antipholus S.'s romantic invitation to Luciana to ""create [him] new"" and ""transform"" him through love (lines 39-40). His promised submission to her (""teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak - line 33)"" reverses Luciana's notions of how a dutiful wife should act. Antipholus S. has failed to complete his identity by finding his brother, but he is asking Luciana to create an identity for him.
	Antipholus S. benefits from the mistaken identities, as he gains a wife (albeit one he does not want), a potential lover in Luciana, and now, a gold chain. Antipholus E., on the other hand, loses his wife, access to his home, and the chain. This may explain why Antipholus S. is better-tempered, but it could equally be argued that Antipholus S.'s freer spirit makes him more open to new experiences and nature's bounty.

Summary
	Angelo is in debt to the Second Merchant, who demanding repayment on pain of arrest. Angelo says that Antipholus E. owes him the same sum of money for the chain (which by mistake has been given to Antipholus S.), and at five o'clock he is due to pay him. If the Merchant will accompany him to Antipholus's house, he will be satisfied.
	Antipholus E., who has been at the Porpentine inn, enters and sends Dromio E. to buy a rope's end, with which he plans to beat his wife and her household for locking him out of his house. Angelo asks Antipholus E. to pay him for his gold chain, so that he can pay the Merchant. But Antipholus never received the chain, and so will not pay. Antipholus E. suggests that Angelo take the chain and the Merchant to his house, where Adriana will pay him on receipt of the chain. Angelo points out that Antipholus E. has the chain, which Antipholus denies, so Angelo has him arrested.
	Dromio S. arrives from the harbor and mistakes Antipholus E. for his master. He tells him he has put their belongings on board a ship bound for Epidamnum. As soon as Antipholus and the ship's owner are on board, the ship will sail. Antipholus E. angrily silences the man he believes to be his servant, since he sent him to get a rope's end. He orders Dromio S. to fetch money from Adriana to pay his way out of jail.
	Analysis
	This scene serves to move the plot complications forward. Antipholus E.'s fortunes continue to decline as a result of the misunderstandings: now, he loses his freedom through being arrested for debt.
	The theme of monetary debt taking precedence over all other considerations of relationship is taken up in Angelo's move to arrest Antipholus E. Only a short time ago, Angelo was to be Antipholus E.'s dinner guest, but the perceived bad debt changed everything.

	Adriana, dubbed a mere 'shrew' by some critics in the past, shows herself to be a more complex character. She is able to curse her husband bitterly but then admit to still loving him almost in the same breath - and sends the money he asks for without a second thought.

Summary
	Antipholus S. muses on the strangeness of the fact that everyone in Ephesus seems to know him: they thank him for favors, show him silk he has ordered, and so forth. Dromio S. arrives with the gold that Adriana has sent to save her husband from prison. Antipholus S. does not understand why Dromio S. has brought him money, since it is the other Antipholus who has been arrested. He asks Dromio S. whether any ships are sailing tonight. Dromio S. replies that he already told him that a ship is leaving soon, and again tries to give his master the money he was ordered to bring. Antipholus S. thinks his servant has been driven mad by the strange atmosphere of Ephesus.
	The Courtesan enters and asks Antipholus S. for the chain he promised her, not realizing that it is the other Antipholus who made this promise. Antipholus S. thinks she is either the devil or a witch and orders her to leave. She asks him for the ring he (actually Antipholus E.) borrowed from her at dinner. Antipholus S., who is afraid of her supernatural powers, flees. Left alone, the Courtesan reflects that he is mad. She says that he has promised her the gold chain in exchange for her ring, but now he will give her neither. Also, he told her at dinner that Adriana had locked him out of his house, and concludes that she did this because he is a lunatic. The Courtesan now intends to complain to Adriana that Antipholus has stolen her ring in a fit of madness, and demand repayment.
	Analysis
	Antipholus S. is increasingly frightened by what he believes to be the culture of witchcraft and sorcery in Ephesus, to such an extent that he only wishes to leave. He is beginning to doubt his own, as well as his servant's, sanity (""The fellow is distract, and so am I, / And here we wander in illusions - /Some blessed power deliver us from hence!"" - lines 40-42). Indeed, his rather hysterical reaction to the Courtesan, branding her a witch or a devil in spite of her reasonable demeanor, suggests that he is close to the brink of losing his reason.

	Antipholus E. is still awaiting the money from Adriana which will buy him out of jail. Dromio E. enters, bringing the rope's end that his master had earlier asked for. He knows nothing about any money. Antipholus E. is furious and beats him. Adriana, Luciana, and the Courtesan enter, bringing Dr Pinch, a schoolmaster who has the reputation of a conjurer. Adriana has engaged Pinch to restore her husband (whom she believes to be mad) to his senses, presumably by exorcism. However, when Pinch tries to feel Antipholus E.'s pulse to diagnose his disease, Antipholus E. hits him. Pinch begins to try to conjure the devils out of Antipholus E, who silences him.
	Antipholus E. contemptuously addresses his wife as if she were a prostitute, asking if those with her are her ""customers"". He asks whether the Courtesan dined at his house today. She replies that he himself dined at home, not knowing that this was the other Antipholus. Antipholus protests that he was locked out of his house, which Dromio E. confirms. Pinch concludes that both Antipholus E. and Dromio E. are mad, and that they must be tied up and laid in a dark room. Antipholus moves as if to attack Adriana (though not stated in the stage directions, this can be inferred from the reaction of the others), accusing her of conspiring with her companions to humiliate him. Frightened, she asks for him to be tied up. As Pinch's assistants try to bind him, he struggles, only confirming Pinch's theory that he is possessed by the devil. Adriana promises the Officer that she will pay off his debts. Pinch and his assistants carry off the bound Antipholus E. and Dromio E.
	The Officer tells Adriana that her husband owes Angelo two hundred ducats for the gold chain. The Courtesan testifies that she saw Antipholus with the chain. But Adriana says he never received the chain and that she has not seen it. She asks the Officer to take her to Angelo so that she can ascertain the truth.
	Antipholus S. and Dromio S. enter, frightened and with swords drawn. Luciana and Adriana think that they are Antipholus E. and Dromio E., escaped from capture, and they flee with the Officer. Antipholus S. tells Dromio S. that even witches are afraid of swords, and orders him to load their belongings on board ship so that they can leave.
	Analysis
	Antipholus E. angrily asks his wife whether the Courtesan dined at his house today, and accuses her of being as much of a strumpet as the Courtesan. The irony is that Adriana was innocently entertaining his twin brother, whereas he was not-so-innocently dining with the Courtesan.
	He loses our sympathy further in his violent attack on his wife. Though he is not mad for the reasons Adriana and Pinch believe, he has succumbed to a more dangerous form of madness - unwarranted jealousy.
	The foolishness of Antipholus S.'s fear of magic, witches and sorcerers is demonstrated in the ludicrous character of Pinch, who is both a schoolmaster and a hobbyist conjurer. Pinch's incantations are absurd rather than sinister.
	As we shall see again in the next act, in the character of the Abbess, Shakespeare mistrusted those who set themselves up to diagnose and 'cure' others, including quacks, mountebanks, purveyors of trite wisdom (such as Polonius in Hamlet), and physicians, and often satirized them. In particular, Thus Antipholus E.'s struggling against being bound confirms Pinch's ridiculous diagnosis of possession by the devil, yet if he did not struggle, he would still be bound. There is a strong sense that one cannot win against such self-appointed authorities, since everything one says is taken as confirmation of their prejudices.

	Adriana, Luciana and the Courtesan enter. Adriana begs Angelo and the Second Merchant not to hurt her husband, who should be excused because he is mad. She orders the men to disarm Antipholus S. and Dromio S, but they escape into a nearby priory. The Abbess comes out to find out what is happening. Adriana explains that her husband is mad and asks permission to go into the priory and fetch him. The Abbess asks if the cause was grief, or a sudden loss of wealth in a shipwreck, or perhaps an illicit love affair. Adriana admits that it might be a love affair. The Abbess tells her that she should have challenged her husband. When Adriana protests that she did, the Abbess says she did not do so strongly enough. Adriana points out that she nagged him incessantly about it. The Abbess quickly does a U-turn and concludes that it was Adriana's incessant jealous nagging that drove her husband mad. Luciana defends Adriana by saying her rebukes to Antipholus were mild, but the Abbess's words have struck a chord in Adriana, who feels guilty about her treatment of her husband.
	The Abbess refuses to let them enter the priory, and says that she will keep Antipholus at the priory and treat him herself. Adriana protests, saying it is her job to look after her husband, but the Abbess will not give in. She dismisses Adriana and goes back into the priory. Adriana decides to ask Duke Solinus to intervene and restore her husband to her.
	It is five o'clock. Duke Solinus enters with the Headsman, leading in Egeon to be executed. The Duke announces that if anybody should pay Egeon's ransom, he will not be executed. Adriana takes this opportunity to ask the Duke for justice against the Abbess. She tells him how her husband went mad, they tried to restrain him, he fled into the priory, and now the Abbess will not release him. The Duke recalls a promise that he made to Adriana when she married to help Antipholus E. on account of his good service in his wars. He agrees to mediate and sends for the Abbess.
	They are interrupted by a Messenger, who reports that Antipholus E. and Dromio E. have broken free from Pinch's men, tied up Pinch, set fire to his beard and then thrown filthy water on him to put the fire out. The Messenger fears that they will kill Pinch unless someone intervenes. Adriana says he is lying, and points out that her husband and his servant are inside the priory. Then Antipholus E. runs in with his servant and demands that the Duke give him justice against Adriana for locking him out and thereby dishonoring him. Adriana denies the charge, saying that she dined with her husband, and Luciana backs her up. Antipholus E. gives his side of the story, accusing Angelo of wrongly claiming that he received the chain, and telling of his capture by Pinch. He also says that he has never been inside the priory.
	The Duke is mystified, and can only explain the confusion by saying it must be the result of witchcraft. Alternatively, he suggests that perhaps they are all mad. The accusations continue and the Duke finally calls for the Abbess, who he hopes will make all clear.
	Egeon sees Antipholus E. and greets him in the belief that he is Antipholus S., the son he has brought up. He suggests to the Duke that his son will pay his ransom. Antipholus E., of course, says he has never seen Egeon before in his life. Egeon thinks that grief must have so changed his appearance during the seven years of their separation that he is unrecognizable to his son. Antipholus E. says he never saw his father in his life. Egeon then wonders if Antipholus is ashamed to acknowledge him. But the Duke confirms that he has been Antipholus's patron for twenty years and during that time he has never seen Syracuse. He says that Egeon must be growing senile.
	The Abbess enters with Antipholus S. and Dromio S. The other characters are amazed at seeing two Antipholuses and two Dromios. The Abbess greets Egeon. She tells him that she is his wife, Emilia, separated from him by the shipwreck, and that the two Antipholuses are their twin sons. She explains that she, Antipholus E. and Dromio E. were taken up from the wreck by men from Epidamnum. But then, some fishermen from Corinth took Antipholus E. and Dromio E. away from her, leaving her with the men from Epidamnum. She did not see them again until now, and in the meantime became the Abbess of the priory.
	The rest of the confusion is sorted out. Antipholus S. tells Luciana that he means to make good on his loving promises to her. Angelo is paid for his gold chain, the ring is returned to the Courtesan, and Antipholus S. returns Antipholus E.'s purse of gold coins to him. Antipholus E. offers the money to the Duke to pay his father's ransom, but the Duke refuses to accept it, declaring that the old man is pardoned. Then, the Abbess invites the entire company into the Abbey for a celebratory feast. Dromio S. tells his brother that Nell (Dromio E.'s romantic interest) gave him dinner earlier; now, he says, this ""fat friend"" will be his sister, not his wife. The two Dromios are the last to file into the priory, ""hand in hand"", ""like brother and brother"" (lines 425-6).
	Analysis
	In her adroit manipulation of Adriana's account of Antipholus's supposed madness, the Abbess, like Pinch, offers another opportunity for Shakespeare to satirize the quack diagnosis, in which anything that one says is taken in such a way as conveniently to confirm a diagnosis already made, and the purveyors of conventional wisdom who dispense such diagnoses. First, the Abbess suggests that Adriana was not tough enough on her husband's infidelities, and that this caused him to lose his reason, but when Adriana insists that she rebuked him night and day about it, the Abbess quickly changes tack and says that Adriana has obviously driven him mad with her jealous nagging. Anyone who has tried to extricate themselves from blame by someone who has decided that they are guilty in advance of hearing the evidence will sympathize with Adriana. Moreover, the Abbess's explanation is wrong, since Antipholus E. is not mad and his apparently erratic behavior is explained by the presence in Ephesus of the two sets of twins. However, Adriana takes the Abbess's rebuke to heart, which suggests that it rang true and that she will try to be gentler with her husband.
	The theme of sorcery and witchcraft as an explanation for transformation is developed further, in that even the Duke, one of the more reasonable characters, falls victim to fears of the supernatural, saying, ""I think you have all drunk of Circe's cup"" (line 271). Circe was a sorceress in Greek mythology. She appears in Homer's Odyssey, where she turns Odysseus's men temporarily into pigs by giving them wine spiked with a magic potion. Continuing his witchcraft thread, when the two Antipholuses and the two Dromios appear together for the first time, he asks, ""of these, which is the natural man, / And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?"" (lines 333-4). The Duke is referring to the ancient Greek idea of the daemon, or attendant spirit, which was supposed to be allotted to a man at birth, and to accompany him throughout life.
	The transformation theme is given a psychological twist by Egeon, when the man he believes to be the Antipholus he brought up denies knowing him (in fact, this is the other Antipholus). He thinks that his features must have been so changed by grief and time during the seven years of their separation that he is unrecognizable to his son.
	The Abbess acts as a kind of deus ex machina (literally, 'god from the machine,' after the god that traditionally descended onto the stage at the end of a play to resolve all conflicts and give everyone their just deserts). She resolves the confusion that has accumulated throughout the play and that reaches its height in this last act. The Abbess's explanation defuses a tension that has been edging dangerously towards a witch-hunt, with even the Duke making accusations of witchcraft and sorcery. Supposed witches, it should be remembered, were still tortured and burnt in Shakespeare's time.
	The Abbess's story does not bear reasoned scrutiny, as it begs such questions as how she could spend twenty years in Ephesus without being aware that her son, the prominent citizen Antipholus E., was also living there. But this play is a farce, full of unlikely elements, such as the two sets of twins being dressed identically even after their long separation. The comedic tradition of the final triumph of love and forgiveness also demands that the Duke suddenly waives the city law that previously inextricably bound him to fine or execute Egeon.
	A curious feature of the play's finale is the absence of any expression of joy or love on the part of the Antipholuses at their reunion. Antipholus E.'s attention seems to be on his wife (he quickly jumps in with a denial that Antipholus S. is her husband, at line 371), and Antipholus S. thinks only of pursuing his suit to Luciana. It is unlikely that Shakespeare simply forgot, as the two Dromios are given a funny and touching exchange (""Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: / I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth;"" - lines 417-8). It is possible that Antipholus E. is still suspicious of an adulterous liaison between his brother and his wife; much is left open to interpretation. We are left with a final image of brotherly love in the form of the play's clowns, the two Dromios, walking hand-in-hand into the celebration feast.
",The Comedy of Errors
501,David Copperfield: Summary: Chapters I-III," 
Preface
	The author expresses both pleasure and sorrow at finishing his novel ?pleasure at having successfully completed this lengthy project, and sorrow at parting from the work, which has become a part of him.
	Chapter I: I am born
	The adult David Copperfield narrates the story of his life, beginning with his birth.
	The women of David's neighborhood believe, based on the time of his birth, that he is destined to be unlucky and that he would possess the gift of seeing ghosts and spirits. On the first prediction, he comments that the story he will tell will reveal its truth or otherwise, and on the second prediction, he comments that he is not aware of having any such gift.
	David's father is already dead when he is born. An aunt of his father's, Miss Betsey Trotwood, turns up on the day of his birth. Betsey was once married to a man who beat her and tried to kill her, and she ended up paying him to stay away from her. Though Betsey was fond of David's father, she was contemptuous of his mother, Clara Copperfield, calling her ""a wax doll.?/p>
	This is the first time that Betsey has met Clara, and she gives her the nickname of Baby because of her youthful appearance. Betsey informs Clara that she is certain that she will give birth to a girl. She intends to be a friend to the girl, and to ensure that she does not place her trust in the type of man who will take advantage of her, as she herself did.
	Later, Mr. Chillip, the doctor, emerges from the birthing room with the news that Clara has had a boy. Without a word, Betsey walks out of the house, never to return.
	Chapter II: I observe
	David describes some of his earliest memories. He remembers his pretty mother, and the kindly nurse, Clara Peggotty, who runs the household. One evening, David is reading to Peggotty from a book about crocodiles. He asks Peggotty if a person whose spouse dies can marry again. Peggotty says that they can if they choose, though she sounds unenthusiastic.
	Clara comes in with Mr. Murdstone, a handsome man with black hair, eyes and whiskers, who is courting her. David takes an instant dislike to him. David falls asleep. When he wakes, he hears that both women are in tears. Peggotty is telling Clara that her former husband, David's father, would not have liked Mr. Murdstone.
	Mr. Murdstone returns one day and takes David on a trip to Lowestoft, a nearby town, to meet some of his business acquaintances. One of the men, Mr. Quinion, jokes with Mr. Murdstone about his courtship of Clara and David's dislike of him. David observes that the men seem to share his wariness of Mr. Murdstone, and that Mr. Murdstone never laughs with them.
	One evening, Peggotty asks David to accompany her on a two-week visit to her brother's at Yarmouth. He excitedly agrees. As he says goodbye to his mother, Mr. Murdstone appears at her side and tells her to control her emotions.
	Chapter III: I have a change
	Peggotty and David travel by carrier's cart to Yarmouth, where they are met at an inn by Peggotty's nephew, Ham. Ham takes them to his family's home, which is a boat converted into a house. Inside there is a smell of fish. Peggotty's brother, Daniel Peggotty, who owns the house, deals in seafood, which he stores in an outhouse. Mr. Peggotty lives in the house with his nephew, Ham, and his niece, Little Em'ly, whom he adopted when their fathers drowned at sea. Also living with Mr. Peggotty is Mrs. Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty's partner in a boat. Mr. Peggotty is an easy-going man who only becomes angry if his generosity in adopting destitute people is mentioned.
	Next morning, David goes out onto the beach with Little Em'ly, where they collect pebbles and fall in love with each other. Little Em'ly says that she is afraid of the sea, which has destroyed so many local men and boats. She also reveals that she wants to be a lady. The adult David reflects that perhaps it would have been better if the sea had swallowed Little Em'ly that morning, so that she would not have to suffer everything that she suffered since.
	Mrs. Gummidge turns out to be a depressed sort of woman, given to complaining that ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me.?She claims that while others may share the adverse conditions that cause her grief, ""I feel it more."" Mr. Peggotty remarks that ""She's been thinking of the old 'un,"" meaning her dead husband.
	At the end of their vacation, Peggotty and David set out for home. David is excited to see his mother again, but Peggotty tries to restrain his enthusiasm. When they reach home, David is baffled that his mother has not come out to the gate to meet him. He fears that she is dead. Peggotty reveals that Clara has married Mr. Murdstone.
	David finds his mother sitting with Mr. Murdstone by the fire. Clara rises to meet David, but Mr. Murdstone tells her again to control her emotions. David finds that his bedroom has been moved to a more distant room. There is a fierce black dog in the kennel in the yard, which springs out to attack him.
	Analysis of Chapters I-III
	The narrator, David Copperfield, looks back on his childhood and tells his story. Though he very occasionally interjects a comment from the perspective of the older and wiser adult, for the most part, he describes events as they appeared to him as a child without adult reflection. This has the effect of reinforcing the naivete and innocence of David as a character. For example, when David accompanies Mr. Murdstone to Lowestoft, Mr. Quinion jokes with the others about David's dislike of Mr. Murdstone. David, being a very young child, has no idea that ""Brooks of Sheffield"" is an invented name to hide the fact that the men are talking about him. In fact, David joins in their laughter at his own expense. It would have been easy for Dickens to add an adult comment to explain that Brooks of Sheffield is really David, but the fact that he does not enables the reader to reach this conclusion independently. The reader is thereby cast in the role of the knowing adult observer, and David retains his childish helplessness and innocence, engaging the reader's sympathy and pity. This authorial technique, in which the reader knows more of the truth than the protagonist does about the other characters' true motives, is called dramatic irony.
	Occasionally, Dickens breaks his practice of giving purely the child's view of David's life, as when the adult David comments that he sometimes feels it would have been better if Little Em'ly had drowned on the day they met, rather than suffer as she has done since. This is an example of foreshadowing, a technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel to create an ominous feeling. The reader is given a sense of Em'ly's future difficulties, setting up an expectation that makes him want to read on and find out what happens to the character.
	Betsey Trotwood's question to Clara Copperfield about whether she and her husband, David's father, were happily married, introduces one of the major themes of the novel: the importance of equality within marriage. Clara's response prompts Betsey to comment disapprovingly that Clara and her first husband were ""not equally matched."" This is a situation with which Betsey is all too familiar, as she herself has been dominated by a cruel husband. The scene with Betsey and Clara is also an example of foreshadowing. Here, Betsey's history warns the reader of the looming disaster of Clara's second marriage, in which she will also be dominated by a cruel husband (Mr. Murdstone). This warning is reinforced by David and Peggotty's instinctive dislike of Mr. Murdstone and by Peggotty's warning that Clara's first husband would not like Mr. Murdstone. The fact that David is removed to Yarmouth in order to allow the marriage to go ahead smoothly is also a foreshadowing of how David's family life will change: he will be excluded from the compact between his mother and her new husband.
	Another foreshadowing technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel is his use of a character's appearance to describe their soul. David's good-hearted and innocent mother is beautiful and childlike in appearance; Mr. Murdstone is as dark of soul as he is of hair; and Peggotty is as warm and honest as her ruddy face and work-roughened hands.
	As well as being defined by their appearance, many characters in the novel are defined by a catchphrase - just as, in a cartoon, a character is defined by one or two distinguishing characteristics, like a big nose or prominent ears. Mrs. Gummidge can be summed up by her catchphrase, ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me."" She remains loyal to her catchphrase until late in the novel, where she surprises everyone by turning into its opposite - but the catchphrase still rules supreme, even as she defies it.
	The characters do not change in their essence throughout the novel; their motivations are established at their first introduction, and remain constant. Little Em'ly retains her desire to be a lady, and it proves her undoing. Clara retains her babyish innocence, and Mr. Murdstone his desire to control her. Betsey's chief motivation is to ensure that no other girl should suffer at the hands of unscrupulous men, as she has. She is bitterly disappointed that Clara does not provide her with a girl child to fulfill her ambition, but in time, she will transfer her protective instinct to David.",David Copperfield

514,Ivanhoe: Summary,"Chapter I
	The story is set in England in the twelfth century, towards the end of the reign of Richard I. Richard is absent from the country. He has been imprisoned in Austria on his return from the Crusades in the Holy Land. In his absence, the nobles have established a tyranny, and the lower classes suffer under it. This situation arose as a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Although four generations have passed since then, there is still hostility between the Normans, who were originally from France, and the conquered population of Anglo-Saxons.
	It is an early evening in summer in a forest in the area of northern England known as the West Riding of Yorkshire. Gurth, the swine-herd, is talking to Wamba, the jester. Both are in the employ of Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon noble. Gurth appeals to Wamba to help him round up the herd, but Wamba is reluctant. Wamba then makes a series of pointed jokes at the expense of the Normans, whom they both dislike. Gurth then complains that the Normans take the best of everything, although Cedric has been valiant in the preservation of Saxon rights. But he fears the imminent visit of a Norman noble, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
	Chapter II
	A group of ten horsemen overtake Wamba and Gurth on the road. The two most important men in this group are an easy-going, generous-minded monk, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and a stern knight of the order of the Knights Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who has been fighting in the Holy Land. The other men are their attendants. The prior and the knight ask Gurth and Wamba the way to Cedric the Saxon’s home, where they desire to stay the night. Gurth is reluctant to give these Normans directions to his master’s dwelling, and he quarrels with the knight. The prior intervenes to keep the peace. Then Wamba gives the men the wrong directions. But when the men reach the place called Sunken Cross, where Wamba told them to turn left, they cannot remember what the directions were. They stop a stranger, who says he is also going to Cedric’s. The stranger, who says he is a palmer (pilgrim) just returned from the Holy Land, then leads them in the right direction until they arrive at Cedric’s mansion.
	Chapter III
	In Cedric’s mansion, the hall is prepared for the evening meal. Cedric sits at his table on a raised dais, waiting for the dinner, which has been delayed, to be served. Several servants stand behind him, and his dogs are at his feet. Cedric is anxious because Gurth has not returned with the herd, and he fears that some misfortune has befallen them, although he is more worried about the herd (which is valuable) than about Gurth. He is also impatient for his favorite clown, Wamba. When Oswald, his cup-bearer, says that Gurth is not that late, since the curfew bell only tolled an hour ago, Cedric is put in an even worse temper. This is because the curfew is a Norman imposition. Cedric rants about all the injustices that accompany Norman rule, and he also mentions his son that he banished. Then the sound of the Knight Templar’s horn outside interrupts him. Cedric is none too pleased to hear who the visitors are, because both are Normans, but he wishes to show hospitality nonetheless. The guests are shown in.
	Chapter IV
	Cedric greets his hosts with dignity, although there is some tension between the Saxon Cedric and his Norman guests. Wamba and Gurth return, to Cedric’s complaints about how tardy they are. The feast is a fine one, and the diners are joined by Cedric’s beautiful young ward, the Lady Rowena. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar, is captivated by her and stares at her, which displeases both Rowena and Cedric. In the discussion over dinner, it transpires that the Knight and Prior are on their way to a tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Another stranger arrives at the gate, and Cedric authorizes his page to allow him to stay the night.
The opening chapters introduce a number of the themes of the novel and show the situations of many of the main characters. Chapter I makes is clear how divided the country is between Normans and Saxons, and how the Norman nobles have established a tyranny. In this theme the author, Sir Walter Scott, is not being true to history. Scholars of the period agree that any hostility between Norman and Saxon did not last for four generations after the Norman Conquest. In those days, people were more conscious of divisions of rank than of national origin. Scott’s picture of Saxons and Normans in fact represents more the typical nineteenth century view of the good-hearted, rough-and-ready English and the foppish, pretentious French. Hostility between England and France was a habit acquired over several centuries of frequent wars between the two countries. (The war in which the English defeated Napoleon was fresh in the minds of the first readers of Ivanhoe, which was published only a few years after Napoleon’s final defeat.)
	The lines of conflict that are to dominate the novel are clearly drawn in the opening chapters. Cedric’s disinheritance of his son is mentioned, and this father-son drama will become an important element in the plot. Lady Rowena is introduced, and as a beautiful young unmarried woman she is clearly going to be the subject of a romantic plot, although De Bois-Guilbert’s early interest in her does prove to be something of a red herring.
	The Norman villain of the novel is also introduced in these early chapters. De Bois-Guilbert is presented as an arrogant, quarrelsome knight, as his treatment of Gurth in Chapter II shows. His susceptibility to women, later to become one of the main plot elements, is also shown. It runs counter to the vow of chastity he took as a member of the Knight Templar Order.
	Just as the representatives of medieval chivalry do not emerge as admirable characters, neither do the representatives of the medieval church. One such representative is introduced in these chapters. The initial description of the Prior tells its own tale. His clothes are much finer than the rules of his Cistercian order permit—a sign of his hypocrisy. The fact that he is overweight, not to mention the twinkle in his eye, indicates that he enjoys the pleasures of eating and drinking.

515,Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary,"Act I Scene 1-2
	The Merry Wives of Windsor begins with Justice Shallow complaining to Sir Hugh Evans that he has been abused by Falstaff. Shallow's cousin Slender backs him up, and Evans agrees to take up the matter on Shallow's behalf.
	Evans then changes the subject, and mentions Anne Page, a girl of marriageable age. Anne has inherited, or will inherit, a sizable amount of money, which makes her a desirable bride. Evans wants to arrange a match between Anne and Slender.
	They go the house of George Page, Anne's father. Falstaff is inside, and Shallow tells Page that Falstaff has wronged him. Page replies that Falstaff has admitted as much.
	Falstaff enters with his cronies, Bardolph, Nym and Pistol. Shallow accuses Falstaff of beating his men, killing his deer and breaking into his lodge. Falstaff admits it, but when Shallow says he will take the matter to the Council, Falstaff tells him he will be laughed at. Slender then says that Bardolph, Nym and Pistol carried him to the tavern, got him drunk, and then picked his pocket.
	Evans replies that he, Page, and the Host of the Garter Inn should arbitrate the matter. Questioned by Falstaff, Pistol denies that he robbed Slender. Bardolph claims that Slender was too drunk to know what was happening and has drawn the wrong conclusion, while Slender vows that in future, he will only get drunk in the company of righteous people, not drunken rogues.
	Anne Page enters with her mother, and Mrs. Ford. Page invites all the company to have dinner with them, and everyone exits except Shallow, Slender and Evans. Evans and Shallow want to know whether Slender thinks he would be able to love Anne Page. Slender agrees to do whatever is expected of him, including marrying the girl. He expresses no great enthusiasm for the prospect, though.
	Anne Page enters and invites them to the dinner table. Shallow and Evans exit, leaving Anne alone with Slender. She tries to persuade him to come to dinner, but Slender says he is not hungry. He is only persuaded when Page returns and summons him, but even then he insists that Anne go in first.
	In scene 2, Evans gives Simple, Slender's servant, a letter to deliver to Mistress Quickly. The letter asks Quickly to inform Anne of the nature of Slender's interest in her.
	Analysis
	The first scene sets the first plot, the courting of Anne Page, in motion. It makes clear that the motivation, at least as far as Evans is concerned, is money. This introduces the theme of the play, which contrasts the lure of money, as well as the match-making attempts of parents and others, with true love.
	This scene also highlights the fact that intermediaries (in this case, Shallow and Evans) are employed to set up the match. Using intermediaries to arrange a marriage was a common practice in Elizabethan England. As Ann Jenalie Cook explains in Making a Match: Courtship in Shakespeare and His Society, ""Especially in the upper social echelons families sought assistance in locating suitable marriage prospects. And, when located, a prospect still might require investigation by trusted friends or persuasion by powerful allies. A crucial decision like marriage could not be left to chance"" (p. 104). Shakespeare will have some fun satirizing the practice in this play.
	The first scene also accomplishes some characterization: Slender as an ineffectual yes-man who merely does what he is told; Shallow as a querulous old man who can no longer wield the authority he once enjoyed; Falstaff as something of a villain who is very much in charge of the situation at this point as he mocks Shallow's attempt to remonstrate with him. By showing Falstaff full of confidence, still the lord of his world, Shakespeare sets him up for his fall.

Act I Scene 3
	Falstaff tells the Host that he must get rid of some of his hangers-on, since his expenses are too high. The Host says he will give Bardolph a job as a tapster, serving liquor. Bardolph likes this idea, saying he has wanted such a life. Falstaff is pleased to get rid of him. Falstaff then confides to Pistol and Nym that he has almost run out of money, but he has hatched a scheme that will remedy his fortunes. He plans to seduce Ford's wife, since she has control of her husband's money. He has written her a love letter, and has also written to Mrs. Page with a similar idea in mind. She also controls her husband's money. Falstaff tells Pistol and Nym to deliver the respective letters, promising them that they will all thrive. But Pistol and Nym refuse, and Falstaff cuts them off from his company and gives the letters to Robin to deliver.
	Seeking revenge on Falstaff, Nym says he will inform Page of Falstaff's plan. Pistol says he will inform Ford.
	Analysis
	This scene sets the second plot, the humiliation of Falstaff, in motion. This plot has similarities with the other plot (the courting of Anne Page), since both are concerned with monetary gain for men through alliance with a woman. But whereas the courting of Anne Page (and her inheritance) is a socially acceptable way of advancing one's own financial interests, Falstaff's attempts to accomplish the same goal fall outside the bounds of the moral code that governs the life of the society depicted in the play.
	The Falstaff depicted in this scene, and throughout the Merry Wives of Windsor, is a lesser character than the witty, astute rogue who appears in Henry IV parts 1 and 2. The Falstaff of the Henry plays, for example, would not be foolish enough to think that the two women concerned were giving him ""the leer of invitation."" This Falstaff lacks both the self-knowledge and the shrewd judgment of the earlier comic figure.

Act I Scene 4
	At Dr. Caius's house, Mistress Quickly has received the letter from Evans, and she questions Simple about who Slender is, as she is having difficulty remembering him. She then instructs him to tell Evans that she will do what she can to further Slender's cause with Anne Page.
	Dr. Caius's servant John Rugby warns Quickly that Caius is on his way home. She shuts Simple in the closet, because she knows Caius will be angry if he finds him in the house.
	Caius enters, speaking almost unintelligible English in a French accent. He summons Rugby and then goes to the closet, where he discovers Simple. He is furious and tells Rugby to fetch his rapier. Quickly tries to calm him down by explaining that Simple came on an errand from Evans. She explains what the errand was, and then tells Simple in an aside that she will do what she can to advance Slender's cause with Anne Page, even though she knows that Caius is also in love with the girl. In the meantime, Caius writes a challenge to Evans (even though Evans was only the bearer of a message) and reproaches Quickly who, he says, promised that he would be able to have Anne. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him.
	After Caius exits, with Rugby in tow, Quickly in a soliloquy says that Caius has no chance with Anne. Quickly claims to knows Anne's mind better than anyone, and also has more influence on her than anyone.
	Fenton enters, inquiring about Anne, whom he wants to marry. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him. Fenton gives Quickly some money, and asks her to put in a good word for him to Anne. Quickly agrees, but after Fenton leaves, she lets on that Anne does not love him.
	Analysis
	Shakespeare's satire of the Elizabethan use of go-betweens in marriage negotiations kicks into high gear in this scene, in the figure of Mistress Quickly. She acts as a kind of universal go-between, promising to help all of Anne's various suitors. In this scene she manages to promise Slender, Caius and Fenton that she is on their side. She claims to know Anne's mind better than anyone. We see no evidence of this in the play, but Quickly seems to have convinced everyone it is true, and she is careful to give all the suitors hope, even if it means telling a few lies. She tells Fenton, for example, that Anne loves him, but as soon as he is gone, she reveals that Anne does not love him. We also see once more how money greases the wheels of love, since Fenton pays Quickly for her service. He gains nothing from this investment, however, since Quickly appears to do nothing at all to advance his cause.

519,Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary: Act II Scene 1,"
	 
Act II Scene 1
	Mrs. Page reads the love letter from Falstaff. She is outraged, especially on account of the fact that she has only met Falstaff a couple of times. She wants revenge on him for writing such a letter.
	Mrs. Ford then enters. She is agitated and asks for Mrs. Page's advice. She has, of course, just read the letter that Falstaff wrote to her. She is just as indignant as Mrs. Page is, and also wants revenge. Her plan is to lead Falstaff on by giving him some false hope.
	Mrs. Page examines the two letters and finds they are identical, except for the person to whom they are addressed. She is indignant, and thinks that Falstaff probably has a thousand such letters prepared, with a blank space where he inserts a different name each time.
	The two women resolve to trick Falstaff by arranging a meeting with him and leading him on him on until he has pawned all his horses to the Host of the Garter Inn. They think that pawning his horses is the only way Falstaff will be able to raise enough money to pursue his courtship of them.
	Mrs. Ford lets on that her husband is a jealous man, while Mrs. Page confesses that her husband is not. The two men then enter, with Pistol and Nym. Pistol is explaining to Ford that Falstaff is after his wife. Ford at first has a hard time believing this, since his wife is not young. But Pistol insists that what he says is true, and he also tells Page to believe what Nym is about to tell him.
	After Pistol exits, Ford says he intends to get to the bottom of the matter. Nym then tells Page that Falstaff loves Page's wife. After Nym exits, Page says he does not believe what he has been told, calling Nym a rogue.
	Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page see Quickly coming, and they resolve to use her to convey their message to Falstaff.
	After the women exit, Ford and Page discuss the allegations against Falstaff. Page dismisses them, saying that Falstaff would not do such a thing, and that those who informed on him are former men of his, so probably-he implies-have a grudge against him. He also says that even if Falstaff did have designs on his wife, he is confident that nothing would come of it. Ford is not so sure, however, and says that he would not trust his wife with Falstaff.
	The Host and then Shallow enter. They invite Page to come and watch a duel to be fought between Evans and Caius. Shallow takes Page aside and tells him that the Host has in fact told the duelers to go to different locations. Host speaks privately to Ford, and says he will introduce Ford, under the name of Brook, to Falstaff. After the Host, Shallow and Page exit, Ford speaks of his suspicions of his wife. She and Falstaff were together at Page's house, and he does not know what might have happened there. He resolves to pursue the matter by sounding out Falstaff.
	Analysis
	This scene reveals just how formidable these ""merry wives of Windsor"" are. They are not so much merry as vengeful, and poor Falstaff has no idea of what he has got himself into. In this play, it is the women who are in charge. It is easy to see why, from their forceful reactions to Falstaff's pitiful attempt to seduce them, that they dominate their husbands (remember that they control their husbands' money, which is why Falstaff is pursuing them).
	This scene also continues the comic parallel and contrast between the two different kinds of wooing in the play, one legitimate and moral, the other illegitimate and immoral. This is accomplished by having Mistress Quickly act as a go-between for Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page, just as she does for the suitors of Anne Page.
",Merry Wives of Windsor

Act II Scene 2
	Pistol asks Falstaff to lend him money, but Falstaff refuses. He says he has had enough of deflecting the demands of Pistol's creditors and swearing to them that Pistol is a reliable man. He is still annoyed by Pistol's refusal to deliver his letter, and this prompts Pistol to relent.
	Mistress Quickly enters, and informs Falstaff that Mrs. Ford is thrilled by his letter. She thanks him a thousand times for it. She also wants him to know that her husband will be away from his house from ten to eleven. She invites Falstaff to visit. Quickly also informs Falstaff that his letter to Mrs. Page has also been well received. Mrs. Page's husband is seldom out of the house, however, but Mrs. Page hopes there will be a time when he is.
	Quickly then arranges for Falstaff's page, Robin, to be the go-between for him and Mrs. Page.
	Falstaff is delighted with his apparent success, and looks forward to getting some money from the two women.
	Bardolph enters, announcing to Falstaff that a man named Brook wishes to see him. Ford enters, disguised as Brook. Ford asks Falstaff for his help. He says he is in love with Mrs. Ford, and has pursued her in earnest, but she is not the slightest bit interested in him. Ford flatters Falstaff about how accomplished a man he is, and asks him to seduce Ford's wife, since he will be able to do it as easily as any man. Ford also offers him money.
	Falstaff does not understand what Ford's purpose is in asking him to do this. Ford explains that Mrs. Ford prides herself on her honor and her virtue. But if he could show her that he knows she has been having an affair with Falstaff, her defenses against him would no longer have any validity, and he would have a better chance with her.
	Falstaff willingly agrees to the proposition, and accepts Ford's money. He says he will be with Ford's wife between ten and eleven. He also takes the opportunity, in the presence of Brook, to insult and deride Ford as a cuckold (a man whose wife commits adultery) and a rogue.
	After Falstaff leaves, Ford gives vent to his jealousy, thinking he has proof of his wife's infidelity. He vows to prevent it from happening and be revenged on Falstaff.
	Analysis
	In this scene, Quickly does more work as a go-between and is true to her promise to keep the secrets of the merry wives. She also shows that being a matrimonial go-between can be a profitable enterprise. Just as Fenton paid her for her anticipated services in the earlier scene, Falstaff pays her in this one. And then money changes hands again when Ford pays Falstaff. ""If money go before, all ways do lie open,"" says Ford, a saying that certainly applies to the play so far, which has shown a lot of financial transactions and much desire for monetary gain, and very little actual love.
	In his outburst of jealousy, Ford is a comic version of other jealous husbands in Shakespeare's plays, such as Leontes (in The Winter's Tale) and Othello, both of whom suspect their wives without cause.

Act II Scene 3
	- Act III Scene 1
	In a field near Windsor, Dr. Caius is angry that Evans has not shown up for the duel. Page, Shallow, Slender and the Host enter, telling Caius that they have come to see the duel, even though they know that Evans has been directed to another place, the other side of town. Caius claims Evans is a coward. He still wants to kill him.
	The men plan to continue their joke at Caius's expense. They agree to take him to Frogmore, where Evans has been sent. But they tell Caius they are taking him to see Anne Page, and he will have the opportunity to woo her. The Host even promises to be his advocate.
	In the next scene, at a field near Frogmore, Evans awaits Caius for the duel and sends Simple out to look for him. After Simple exits, Evans reveals that secretly he is relieved Caius has not shown up.
	Page, Shallow and Slender enter. Pretending that they do not know what the situation is, they tell Evans that Caius is nearby, and is very upset at being wronged. In a show of bravado, Evans denounces him as a cowardly knave.
	The Host, Caius and Rugby enter. Evans and Caius offer to fight, but Evans also takes Caius aside and offers him friendship, while saying aloud for the benefit of the others that he will beat Caius up for reneging on his appointment. Caius makes some aggressive remarks, but the Host calms the situation down and confesses that he deliberately directed them to different places because he did not want to lose either his doctor (Caius) or his priest (Evans). He asks them to put away their swords and be reconciled. After the Host exits, Caius and Evans agree to be revenged on him for his deceit. Caius is angry because he was told that he would be meeting Anne Page there.
	Analysis
	These short scenes are mostly a diversion from the main plots. Both are examples of dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience, or the other characters, know something about the situation that one or more characters do not. In Act 2, scene 2, for example, all but Caius know that Evans has been deliberately directed by the Host to another part of town, so the duel will not take place. (This information is conveyed in Act 2, scene 1.) The humor of the scene consists in the mocking of the pompous and hot-tempered Caius, and his exclamations in terrible English, just as the humor of Act 3, scene 1 is at the expense of Evans, the other would-be duelist. The humor lies in the contrast between Evans's fighting words and his real, less courageous sentiments.

	Ford encounters Mrs. Page with Falstaff's page, Robin, which leads Ford to jump to conclusions and mock the absent Page for his stupidity in not suspecting his wife. He vows that he will torture his wife, expose Mrs. Page and show what a fool Page is. He resolves to go to his own house when he knows Falstaff will be there with his wife.
	Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Evans and Caius enter. They are on their way to dine with Anne Page. Shallow and Slender hope to have an answer that day as to whether Slender will be able to marry Anne. Page supports his suit, but Mrs. Page prefers Caius. Host mentions Fenton, but Page says that Fenton is from too high a social class to be suitable for his daughter.
	Ford invites them all to his house to witness a monster (that is, Falstaff).
	Analysis
	Caius's remark to Page that Mistress Quickly has told him that Anne loves him shows that Quickly has been working behind the scenes to encourage her clients, even if that means completely disregarding the truth.
	Page's complete rejection of Fenton, in spite of the Host's extravagant praise of the young man, comes down, as does so much in this play, to a matter of money. Page says Fenton is too worldly wise and keeps company with a higher level of society than would be suitable for the middle-class Anne, but this is really only a smokescreen. His real complaint seems to be that Fenton, although of a higher social class, has no money, and Page is determined that Fenton is not going to repair his fortune's at Page's expense: ""no, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance."" Money rules!

Act III Scene 3
	At Ford's house, Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page rehearse their plot to dump Falstaff in a dirty laundry basket and empty it in a muddy ditch on the banks of the River Thames.
	Falstaff enters and declares his love for Mrs. Ford. Mrs. Ford goes along with him, replying that she loves him too. But then, as rehearsed, Robin enters, saying that Mrs. Page has arrived in a state of some excitement, and must see Mrs. Ford immediately. Falstaff, not wanting Mrs. Page to find him there, hides behind an arras (a tapestry wall-hanging).
	Mrs. Page rushes in and says that Ford is coming to the house, with a crowd of officials, to look for a man who is taking advantage of Mrs. Ford in her husband's absence. Mrs. Page urges her friend to get rid of the man, if he is indeed there. She suggests putting him in the laundry basket. Mrs. Ford says he is too big for it, but then the terrified Falstaff, who has overheard all of this-as he was meant to-emerges from his hiding place and says he can fit in the basket. Mrs. Page professes surprise to see him there, and asks him if the letters are his. He has time only to say that he loves her before he gets into the basket. Mrs. Ford summons her servants to take the basket away.
	Ford, Page, Caius and Evans enter as the servants exit. Ford locks the door of the house. He goes to search the house, and the other men follow him.
	Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford enjoy their joke and plan more tricks against Falstaff. They agree to send Mistress Quickly to him to excuse the incident and give him fresh hope. Then they will lead him on to another punishment.
	Ford and the others return. Since they have found no one, Ford is forced to admit that he was in the wrong, and he asks his wife to forgive him.
	Analysis
	This amusing central scene constitutes the first of Falstaff's three humiliations. The humor is the physical humor of farce, rather than the intellectual humor that characterizes Falstaff's scenes in the Henry IV plays. For those who are reading the play rather than watching a performance of it, it is essential to try and stage this scene in the mind's eye in order to appreciate it.

Act III Scene 4
	Fenton tells Anne Page that he is discouraged in his attempt to win her hand, because her father is refusing to support him. He says that at first he courted Anne because her father was wealthy, but he has since come to see that she is worth more than any amount of gold. Anne tells him not to give up, but to continue to seek her father's favor.
	Shallow, Slender and Mistress Quickly enter. They have brought the painfully shy Slender to talk to Anne. He is scared of approaching her, and when he and Shallow do approach, he lets Shallow do all the talking, merely echoing what Shallow says. Anne finally asks Shallow to let Slender woo her by himself. Slender does not do much to advance his cause. He tells Anne that he is wooing her only because her father and his uncle put his name forward. He does not seem to care much whether he marries Anne or not.
	Page enters with his wife, and urges Anne to love Slender. He is annoyed to see Fenton there as well, and reiterates that he will not give Fenton permission to marry his daughter.
	After Page, Shallow and Slender have gone, Fenton presses his claims with Mrs. Page, saying that he loves Anne. Anne pleads that she does not want to marry Slender, whom she thinks is a fool. Nor does she want to marry Caius, whose suit Mrs. Page appears to be considering. After her daughter's protests, Mrs. Page softens her tone, and tells Fenton she will talk to Anne and find out how she feels about him.
	Left alone with Fenton, Quickly tells him that is it because of her that he now appears to have a chance with Anne. After Fenton exits, Quickly says that she will in fact continue to act as advocate for Caius and Slender, but also, and specially, for Fenton.
	Analysis
	This scene is written partially in verse, the first scene in the play to use verse. Appropriately enough, the blank verse lines are given to Fenton, the gentleman, who explains to Anne that although he pursued her at first for her money, he now loves her for herself. This is the first counterweight to the predominant theme of money as the main motivating factor in prospective marriages. Here it is love that is important, not money, and Fenton and Anne have to figure out a way of enabling love to triumph. The scene with Fenton and Anne is immediately contrasted with the ludicrous attempt of Shallow to get Slender to make an impression on Anne, which he totally fails to do. The message is clear: real love is superior to attempts made by advocates and go-betweens to secure a marriage based on expediency rather than love.
	Mistress Quickly is still getting up to her tricks and profiting by them. She convinces Fenton that the softening of Anne's mother towards him is her own doing, and then accepts another payment from him. For Quickly, match-making continues to be a profitable business!

	Falstaff tells Bardolph to get him some wine and a piece of toast. He speaks with disgust of his ordeal in being tossed into the river. Quickly enters, and Falstaff responds coldly to her. Quickly then explains that Mrs. Ford has told her that the men made a mistake in throwing the basket into the river. It was not her fault, and she is upset about it. She sends word that her husband will be out hunting birds from eight to nine, and she desires to see Falstaff again. Falstaff agrees to try again.
	Ford enters, disguised again as Brook. He inquires about what happened between Falstaff and Mrs. Page. Falstaff tells him the entire truth, including another long speech about the discomfort and indignity he suffered in the basket. Ford assumes that Falstaff will no longer be pursuing Mrs. Ford, but Falstaff tells him of the new plan. It is past eight o'clock so he is ready to depart. He promises Brook again that he, Brook, will enjoy Ford's wife.
	After Falstaff exits, Ford is once more beside himself with jealousy and vows that Falstaff will not escape this time.
	Analysis
	In his soliloquy at the beginning of the scene, in which he laments his ducking in the Thames, Falstaff shows some of the wit and verbal exuberance that mark his character in the Henry IV plays. If earlier in the play, he has been something of a villain, threatening to disrupt the harmony of the community, here he appears more as victim than villain. These opposite perspectives on his character and his role in the play will continue until the end.
	However, for all the wit Falstaff shows in verbalizing about his humiliation, he is still easily taken in by the merry wives' next scheme. In this respect he appears as little more than a stage buffoon rather than one of the great comic characters in English drama. Those who love Falstaff from the Henry plays are often distressed by his reduction in stature (although not in physical bulk) here.

Act IV
	Scene 1-2
	Scene 1 is a short scene which is a digression from the main plot. Evans tries to instruct Mrs. Page's son William in Latin grammar.
	In scene 2, Falstaff speaks to Mrs. Ford in Ford's house. But he has only just begun his latest attempt at seduction before Mrs. Page rushes in. Falstaff hides in another room. Mrs. Page announces that Ford, in another wild fit of jealousy, is on his way over to the house, with a group of friends. Falstaff refuses to go in the basket again, but he cannot leave the house, which is already guarded by three of Ford's brothers. Mrs. Page has the idea of disguising Falstaff, and then he can leave. Mrs. Ford says that her maid's aunt, known as the fat woman of Brainford has a gown upstairs. Falstaff exits to put on the gown, as well as her hat and muffler.
	Mrs. Ford wishes that her husband might find Falstaff in this disguise, since he hates the fat woman of Brainford and has threatened to beat her. Once again, the women are pleased with the success of their joke.
	Mrs. Ford arranges for the servants to be carrying the linen basket when her husband arrives. Sure enough, when Ford arrives, he demands to see what is in the basket, and pulls the clothes out himself. Of course, there is no one in the basket, and Evans, Shallow and Page reproach him, believing him to be mistaken in his jealousy. Ford persuades them to join him in a search of the house.
	Falstaff enters, disguised, with Mrs. Page. Ford is outraged, because he has forbidden the fat woman of Brainford to enter his house. He attacks Falstaff and beats him as he runs away.
	When the men exit, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford express their satisfaction at the beating Falstaff received. They plan to tell their husbands everything, and relish the prospect of Falstaff's public shaming. They also say they will be prepared to teach Falstaff another lesson, if their husbands desire it.
	Analysis
	Once more Falstaff attempts to seduce Mrs. Ford with ridiculously inflated language (scene 2, lines 1-6). But after that the humor, as with the laundry basket scene, is all physical-Falstaff's disguise, the beating he gets from Ford. There is no subtlety about it. There is also, as some commentators have remarked, some repetitiveness about the plotting. At the close of Act 3, Falstaff divulged his plans once again to the disguised Ford, just as he had done in Act 2, scene 2. And in this scene, the jealous Ford once again rushes to his house and searches for the malefactor. The difference of course is that this time he is successful, even though he does not realize that the intruder is Falstaff. Falstaff's punishment is also more severe in this scene than in the earlier one, since being beaten is surely worse than getting drenched in a dirty laundry basket.

Act IV
	Scene 3-4
	In scene 3, Bardolph tells the Host that the Germans who have been staying at the Garter Inn need to have three of his horses, to meet the Duke at court. The Host agrees, but says he will make them pay for the horses.
	In scene 4, Ford, who has been shown the letters Falstaff wrote and how the women responded to them, asks forgiveness of his wife.
	Then Page, Ford, their wives, and Evans plan yet another trick on Falstaff. The women will ask him to meet them in the wood at night, disguised as Herne the Hunter, the spirit of a man who used to be a keeper in the forest. Herne is said to appear with great horns and cause mischief in the wood. When Falstaff comes and meets the women, Anne Page and a few more children will pretend to be fairies and rush at him. The women will run away, and the children will encircle him and pinch him and ask him why he dares to tread on their sacred paths.
	Mrs. Ford suggests that the fairies will continue to pinch him and burn him with tapers until he admits the truth. Then everyone else will appear and mock Falstaff all the way back to Windsor.
	Page plots to allow Slender to marry his daughter immediately after the joke in Windsor forest, while Mrs. Page lays plans to marry Anne off to Caius. She thinks Slender is an idiot, whereas Caius has money, as well as friends at the royal court.
	Analysis
	The horse-stealing described in scene 3 begins a new subplot. Since it emerges so suddenly, is not connected to the main action, and never fully resolves itself, some scholars posit the idea of a ""lost scene"" of the play, in which this sub-plot was resolved. Others have argued that the horse-stealing is a plot hatched by Caius and Evans, who in Act 3, scene I resolve to be revenged on the Host because he has deceived them. But this revenge is never enacted, unless it takes place through this horse-stealing episode.
	The role of wealth and social position in producing a desirable marriage is again emphasized in scene 4, when Mrs. Page says that her daughter will marry Caius because he has money and favor at court. She is determined to stick to her choice even if twenty thousand worthier men come to court Anne.
",Merry Wives of Windsor

Act IV
	Scene 5-6
	At the Garter Inn, Simple is looking for the fat woman of Brainford. She is also known as a wise woman, and he has a question to ask her from Slender. Simple asks to see Falstaff, because he has caught sight of him still in his disguise and thinks that the woman is in Falstaff's room. After Falstaff tells the Host that she has gone, Simple tells Falstaff that Slender wanted to ask the wise woman whether he would marry Anne Page. (Apparently the old woman has a reputation as a fortune-teller.) Falstaff gives him a ""wise guy"" answer that doesn't tell him anything, and says he heard it from the old woman herself. Satisfied with this, Simple leaves.
	Bardolph enters with news that the Germans have stolen the Host's horses, but the Host is loathe to believe the worst of his guests. That is, until Evans enters with the information that the Germans have tricked all the innkeepers of the nearby towns of their horses and their money. Caius confirms that there is no duke at the court who goes by the name that the Germans have supplied. Distressed, the Host calls for a hue and cry to catch the thieves. He exits with Bardolph.
	Mistress Quickly enters and says she has come from Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford. Falstaff is in no mood to listen to her, and says he has suffered enough. She says that the women have suffered too, especially Mrs. Ford, who has been badly beaten by her husband. Quickly presents Falstaff with a letter (presumably from Mrs. Ford or Mrs. Page), and he invites her into his room.
	In scene 6, Fenton promises to pay the Host even more money than he has lost if he will cooperate with him. Fenton explains that Anne has been told by her father to slip away from the forest in her disguise as the fairy queen, and go to Eton where she will be immediately be married to Slender. Fenton says that Anne has consented to this plan (which obviously is against her wishes). But Mrs. Page, says Fenton, has other plans. She has arranged for Anne to slip away and be married to Caius, to which plan it appears that Anne has also agreed. Page expects his daughter to be dressed in white in the forest, whereas Mrs. Page expects her to be dressed in green. The color of her clothing is important because that is how the would-be grooms will be able to recognize her. Fenton wants the Host to secure the services of a vicar and to wait at the church, where he intends to bring Anne and marry her.
	Analysis
	Act 4, scene 5 concludes the subplot about the horse-stealers. Although it is not really integrated with the main action of the play, it does have some thematic relevance. Virtually everyone in the play tries at some point to deceive someone else, and yet the deceivers eventually discover that they have also been deceived (this will not become fully apparent until the last Act). The deceit of the Host in this subplot contributes to this theme, since earlier he practiced his own form of deceit (on Caius and Evans).
	In scene 6, Fenton's speeches in blank verse are the longest verse passages in the play. They serve to inform the audience of the plots that will create some of the humor in the last act.

Act V
	Scene 1-5
	Falstaff has agreed to go to the wood, hoping this will be third time lucky. Ford, disguised as Brook, enters, and Falstaff tells him to go to the forest at midnight. He tells Brook about his misadventure disguised as the old woman of Brainford, disparages Ford and promises vengeance on him, and promises that Brook will have Ford's wife.
	In scene 2, on the outskirts of Windsor forest, Page, Shallow and Slender rehearse their plans. Shallow tells Slender that he will recognize Anne by her white garments.
	In scene 3, Mrs. Page tells Caius that her daughter will be dressed in green, and that he should slip away with her whenever a moment presents itself. She knows her husband will be angry, but she thinks that is better than the heartbreak that would ensue if Anne is forced to marry Slender.
	Eagerly anticipating yet another humiliation of Falstaff, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford depart for Windsor Park.
	In scene 4, in the park, Evans leads the children disguised as fairies and tells them to remember their parts.
	In scene 5 Falstaff enters, wearing a buck's head, as he has been instructed. It is just after midnight. Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page enter, and Falstaff embraces Mrs. Ford. He is delighted to hear that Mrs. Page is there also. But then there is the sound of horns, and the women run away.
	Evans enters, dressed like a satyr (a mythical creature, half-man, half-beast), with Anne Page and the children, Pistol dressed as a hobgoblin, and Mistress Quickly dressed like the Queen of Fairies. Quickly and Pistol speak some rhymes addressed to the fairies. Falstaff, believing that anyone who speaks to fairies will die, lies face down and closes his eyes.
	Evans and Quickly recite more verses and then command the fairies to dance around the tree, next to which Falstaff lies. Spotting him, Evans commands the fairies to put their tapers to Falstaff's fingers. He gives a start, and the fairies then dance around him, pinch him and recite a scornful rhyme. While this is going on, Caius steals away with a boy in green; Slender with a boy in white (each thinks he has got Anne Page), while Fenton steals away with Anne. After a noise of hunting is made, the fairies run away.
	Page, Ford and their wives disclose themselves to Falstaff and mock him. He realizes that he has been made a fool of, but this does not stop their mockery. Falstaff resigns himself to enduring their insults.
	Page invites Falstaff to his house for dinner, where he will be able to laugh at Mrs. Page (who is now laughing at him), because she will have found out that her daughter has married Slender (or so Page thinks). In an aside, Mrs. Page discloses that Anne has in fact married Caius (or so she thinks).
	Then Slender enters, distressed. He tells how the person he thought was Anne Page turned out to be a boy. Page rebukes him for making a mess of their plan, but Slender explains that he followed it exactly. Mrs. Page tells her husband not to be angry, and explains that she put her daughter in green to foil his plan, and that Anne is now married to Caius.
	Caius enters, and tells a story just like Slender's. He eloped with a boy, thinking it was Anne.
	Fenton and Anne enter. They are married. Fenton rebukes her parents, saying that they wanted her to marry without love. He and Anne are now united and should not be accused of disobedience, since they married for love. Anne therefore avoided a forced, unhappy marriage. Page forgives them, and his wife follows his example. She invites everyone to their home where they can all laugh at what has happened. Falstaff is invited too, and Ford appears to be ready to forgive him his folly.
	Analysis
	In the final scene, the community of Windsor comes together and overcomes the threat embodied in Falstaff by exposing and ridiculing him. In doing so they reaffirm the moral and social order that governs their lives. Mrs. Page gives the moral of the play in Act 5, scene 3: ""Against such lewdsters and their lechery / Those that betray them do no treachery.""
	But anyone who knows the Henry IV plays will be disappointed to see the great wit and rogue Falstaff laid low in this manner. His abject submission, ""Use me as you will,"" and his comment, ""I am not able to answer,"" could not possibly have been uttered by the Falstaff of the Henry plays, who is never at a loss for words and can talk himself out of any situation.
	If Falstaff is thoroughly humiliated, the other characters do not emerge unscathed either. In the marriage plot concerning Anne Page, the deceivers are themselves deceived, and their materialistic values rebuked. The young lovers, Fenton and Anne, overcome the cold practicalities of middle age. Fenton is like Falstaff in the sense that he too transgressed the social order, since he had no permission to marry Anne, but he asks for and receives forgiveness.

530,Middlemarch: Novel Summary,"Prelude
Summary
	This is a charming vignette of Saint Theresa of Avila as a little girl, holding her brother by the hand, going out into the country side looking for martyrdom, illustrating the “passionate, ideal nature [that demands] an epic life.” Such a girl who has a “rapturous consciousness of life beyond self” could hardly be content with a normal woman’s life. She is the type of many such women today who yearn for an expanded life but are not helped by the “tangled circumstance” of society. This tragic sort of woman in the modern world has no channel for her life force, but only a “vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood.” She is a swan among ducks and finds no fellowship.
	Analysis
	Eliot’s famous Prelude to Middlemarch could be the outcry of the Victorian woman, or women of any age, who have no outlet for their talents or direction for their spiritual lives. They are like the child Theresa, who nevertheless, even in a man’s world, grew up to reform a religious order. Eliot sets up an epic question: what sort of heroism is possible in the modern world, especially for women? Her main character, Dorothea Brooke, is such a modern St. Theresa.
Chapters 1-5 (The Brooke Sisters)
Summary
	Dorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Celia, are two young ladies of marriageable age who have recently come to live with their bachelor uncle and guardian, Mr. Brooke, at Tipton Grange. Though Dorothea is the striking and beautiful older sister, the rural opinion favors the pretty Celia as the one who is easier to understand. While Celia knows life through common sense, Dorothea is always out of place with her refined religious perceptions and longings. Dorothea is severe and Puritanical compared to Celia, who has normal coquettish desires for dress, jewelry, and conquests.
	Dorothea does not want a husband like the neighbor, Sir James Chettham, an amiable but ordinary squire, who is in love with her. She thinks him boring, though in her passion for good works, she persuades him to build decent cottages for his tenants and gives him her designs. He goes along with her plans as he prepares to propose to her. No one reckons on Dorothea’s lofty thoughts of an ideal husband, who would be her superior in learning, and spiritually elevated. Into the picture steps Reverend Casaubon, a clergyman of fifty. Dorothea, not yet eighteen, immediately romanticizes him as a type of Milton or Locke. She wants to devote herself to someone who can teach her wisdom. Mr. Brooke tries to dissuade her from getting engaged to Casaubon, but she accepts him, to everyone’s shock.
Analysis
	One of the main characters of the novel is the narrator who tells the story from the multiple points of view of the characters, while adding her own reflective wisdom. This vantage point gives us compassionate insight into each character but within a certain social context, for the narrator stands for the collective wisdom gleaned from all the lives put together. This narrator is “omniscient” and anonymous, though we can think of her as close to George Eliot’s own viewpoint.
	Immediately, the narrator begins to uncover the fact that most people are lost in their own illusions of reality, one of the themes of the book. She brilliantly weaves together the intersecting illusions of all the characters, showing us the profile of the town of Middlemarch, a fictitious small town in the rural English midlands in the early nineteenth century. Middlemarch stands for English life just before the impact of the industrial revolution. The time is just before the great Reform Bill of 1832. Life is still somewhat simple and conventional here in this backwater, and the citizens are not interested in anything but daily concerns. This sets the stage for their clashes with the more extraordinary and farsighted characters, Dorothea and Lydgate and Will Ladislaw who stand for the forces of change.
	While it could be rather farcical that the beautiful Dorothea, who is constantly compared to the Blessed Virgin, is marrying Casaubon, the “dried bookworm of fifty,” Eliot treats Dorothea’s “soul hunger” as a real and tragic phenomenon in this society. She has no teacher or even comrade to whom she may tell of her own exalted thoughts and wishes. Even her sister Celia, though adoring her, criticizes her, and does not understand her need for living her religious vision in daily life. Dorothea thinks that Casaubon will understand and teach her, while he, it is clear, expects an obedient and self-abnegating wife. The narrator gives us foreshadowing of this problematic marriage by explaining Dorothea’s short-sightedness and “theoretic” nature, desire for “intensity and greatness.” Casaubon also has trouble with his vision and needs a secretary to help him with his life work, The Key to All Mythologies.

531, The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary ,"Chapter 1

Summary
	The story begins in the fall of 1897, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. Buck is a large, one-hundred and forty pound dog who lives on a ranch owned by Judge Miller in Santa Clara, California, some forty miles south of San Francisco.
	Buck is four years old and has an enjoyable life. Unlike the other, smaller dogs on the ranch, he is allowed to roam over the entire property. He goes into the swimming tank, hunts with the judge's sons, and escorts the judge's daughters on their morning walks. In the winter he lies at the feet of the judge in front of the fire in the library. He is like a king who lords it over all the other creatures, and is treated with respect by everyone.
	Buck's comfortable life is ended when Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, take him for a walk and sells him to a man who treats him roughly and throws him into the baggage car of a train. Halfway through the night Buck is transferred to a cage-like crate. In the morning, four men come to pick up the crate. They amuse themselves by poking sticks at him. Buck is conveyed to a railway depot, where he is placed in an express car. He stays there for two days and nights, during which he neither eats nor drinks. He is bundled off the train at Seattle, where a man in a red sweater takes charge of him. The man lets Buck out of the cage, and Buck attacks him in fury, but the man brutally beats him into submission with a club. Buck is beaten but his spirit is not broken. In the days that follow, more dogs arrive, and Buck watches as they are beaten in the same fashion. Adapting to his new situation, Buck realizes that the man is the master and must be obeyed.
	Buck is then sold to a man named Perrault, a Canadian government mail-driver, who realizes from Buck's impressive appearance that he is a dog in a thousand. Along with a dog named Curly, they travel north on the deck of the ship, Narwhal. The dogs are turned over to Francois, a swarthy French-Canadian. Buck learns to respect both men, since they are calm and fair. There are two other dogs on the ship, a big dog from Spitzbergen, and a gloomy one named Dave, who just likes to be left alone. The weather gets colder as they head north, and Buck encounters snow for the first time.
	Analysis
	The Call of the Wild can be read simply as an adventure story about a dog, but most commentators see in it something deeper than that. There are many parallels between the world of dogs and the world of humans, so the novel can be read as a kind of human allegory. Buck himself is given emotions such as pride and shame, and an awareness of abstract ideas such as justice.
	In the first chapter Buck takes the first steps to discovering a different kind of law of life than he has known at Judge Miller's ranch. His life there is very orderly and civilized. He is like a ""sated aristocrat""; he is compared to a country gentleman and a lord (since he is lord over all the other animals on the ranch). In this civilized life, wild impulses are tamed. Buck enjoys comfort and privilege. He does not have to fight for anything; all his needs are provided for. He has not had to earn his position; like an aristocrat, he was born to it. But his deeper nature is unknown to him, and this is what he will discover during the course of the novel. It is a painful journey. In chapter 1, for example, he learns for the first time that there can be other relationships between man and dog than the one he has known. The man in the red sweater who clubs him into submission is his introduction to a ruthless world in which the strong rule, and Buck makes his first adaptation to it.

533,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Summary
	Buck's first day on the beach at the port city of Dyea (just across from Skagway, Alaska), is a nightmare. The other dogs are savage and fight. Curly is killed by a pack of dogs after she goes down in a fight. Buck starts to hate Spitz because Spitz laughs at the scene.
	Buck is again shocked when Franeois puts him in harness with the other dogs and puts him to work, pulling a sled. Franeois maintains firm discipline, and Buck learns easily to recognize and obey the commands. Spitz is the team leader.
	Two more dogs arrive, Billie and Joe. Billie is good-natured, but Joe is sour, with a perpetual snarl. Then another dog, Sol-leks, arrives. His name means the Angry One. Spitz, who had bullied the other newcomers, leaves him alone.
	At night, Buck is surprised to find that he is excluded from the warm tent. Outside, it is far too cold to sleep. But he soon learns to dig himself a hole in the snow, and sleeps warm.
	In the morning, three more huskies are added, making nine in all. They take a trail toward the Dyea Canon. The work is hard but Buck does not despise it, and Dave and Sol-leks, who are placed either side of him, are good instructors.
	They travel north across glaciers and snowdrifts and lakes, and late at night pull into camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where there are thousands of men who have come seeking gold.
	The next day they travel forty miles, but in subsequent days, as they break their own trail, they cannot travel as fast. Buck toils in the traces for many long days. He is given a pound and a half of sun-dried salmon every day, but he finds it is not enough, although the other dogs, who weigh less, find it adequate. He learns how to steal bacon from Perrault, because this is necessary in order to survive. In other ways, too, he adapts to his new, ruthless environment. His muscles become hard, and he is impervious to pain. His senses become extremely acute.
	Analysis
	The law of club and fang is Buck's interpretation of the laws that govern the new life he is leading. It is a ruthless, Darwinian world of the survival of the fittest, a total contrast to what he has known in his first four years of his life. There is no room here for kindness and love, or morality. The death of Curly shows him that just as he has learned a new relationship between man and dog, here in the north there is a new relationship between dog and dog. A dog must prevail through ferocity, strength and courage; to show weakness is to be killed. It is notable how quickly he adapts to all the challenges that face him. He has left the civilized world far behind. He is now prepared to steal food for his master, something that would not have occurred to him in his life with Judge Miller.
	A key passage occurs near the end of the chapter. Buck may have had many generations before him of domesticated dogs, but he retains an instinctual memory of the behavior of his ancestors, before they were tamed by man. He learns so quickly because he is able to tap into these primitive instincts. They were always there within him, but the cosseted, lazy life he led on Judge Miller's ranch did not bring them out. Now he is bringing forth the forgotten side of his nature: ""It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.""
	At the level of the human allegory, this suggests that there is a lot more to human life and behavior than what is revealed in civilized society. Men too, in certain conditions, will revert to a more instinctual, primitive level of life, in which the law of the jungle usurps civilized morality.

534,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"Chapter 3
Summary
	The deadly rivalry between Spitz and Buck grows. One night Buck makes his nest under a sheltering rock, but when Buck returns after eating his food, he finds that Spitz has taken it over. He attacks Spitz, but their fight is interrupted when the camp is invaded by about fifty starving huskies who have scented the camp from an Indian village. They try to steal all the food. Three of them attack Buck, and the other sled dogs are attacked, too. Francois and Perrault drive them off. All the nine team-dogs are injured. They regroup in the forest and return to camp at daybreak.
	They set off again, down the partially frozen Thirty Mile River, covering only thirty miles in six days. The temperature is fifty below zero. Once, the sled falls through the ice on the river, and Buck and Dave are nearly drowned. Another time, Spitz goes through the ice, and only the strength of Buck and the others saves them all. Then the ice breaks and they have to escape by climbing a cliff. That day they cover only a quarter of a mile.
	Weathering all the difficulties, they persevere. Buck's feet are not as tough as those of the other dogs, and get very sore. Francois makes moccasins for him out of the tops of his own moccasins. Later, Buck's feet get harder, and the moccasins are thrown away.
	One morning, Dolly suddenly goes mad, and Francois kills him with an axe. Spitz attacks Buck but is driven off by Francois's whip. From that point on it is a war between Spitz, the lead dog, and Buck, since Spitz feels threatened by Buck. On another occasion, when Spitz is punishing the malingerer Pike, Buck attacks him, but this time it is Buck who is driven off by the whip wielded by Francois.
	They arrive in Dawson, in the Yukon territory. They spend a week there, before making the return trip, with Perrault carrying important dispatches. They cover fifty miles in the first day. But the dog-team is not harmonious, since Buck's rebellion against Spitz has destroyed the solidarity of the team. In a breakdown of discipline, the other dogs also challenge Spitz.
	As the dog-pack chases down a rabbit, with Buck in the lead, Spitz cuts him off and gets to the rabbit first. This initiates a fight between the two dogs. Buck is triumphant, and Spitz is killed.
	Analysis
	This chapter vividly shows the difficulties and the dangers that the travelers encounter, both external and internal. (Madness afflicts one of the dogs.) As the strongest, Buck inevitably triumphs over Spitz. It is his destiny to become the ""dominant primordial beast."" He uses cunning as well as strength, and he is infinitely patient. He knows how to use his wiles to undermine Spitz's authority with the other dogs, and as a result there is general insubordination amongst the dog-team. Buck has left a human community, with tame animals, but has found himself in another, more ruthless kind of animal community in which the pack dominates, and every pack needs a leader.
	In regressing to a more primitive state, and becoming leader of the pack, Buck discovers for the first time a kind of superior joy, greater than anything he could have known on Judge Miller's ranch. He is getting in touch with the energy of life itself as it surges up within him, not tempered by any civilized or moral values, which, from this point of view, dilute rather than enhance life. London makes this clear in eloquent words: ""There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive."" In the harsh conditions that prevail in Alaska, in which Buck must be constantly alert, and is constantly put to the test, he discovers his true nature.

535,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"Summary
	The next morning, as Franeois harnesses the dogs, he tries to install Sol-leks in the lead position. But Buck refuses to accept this. He wants to be the lead dog, and will not settle for anything less. Franeois and Perrault at first try to beat him into obedience, but Buck keeps out of reach. Eventually Buck wins the battle of wills and is installed as the lead dog. He excels in the position, and quickly restores discipline in the team. Two more dogs, Teek and Koona, are acquired, and Buck breaks them in. The weather is comparatively benign and they make good progress, averaging forty miles a day for fourteen days until they reach Skagway.
	Franeois and Perrault are ordered elsewhere by the government, and leave Buck behind. He makes the trip back to Dawson with his team under a new master. They are extremely tired but get only a two-day break before setting off once more. At nights, Buck has visions of life from long ago; he sees a caveman and large beasts of prey. He is fascinated by these visions, which take him further back into primitive times.
	The dogs get more and more weary, and Dave in particular weakens. He is taken out of the traces, but he resents this. He wants to continue to do his job despite the fact that he is too weak to do to. So his driver puts him back in harness, and Dave continues to pull, falling down several times. They reach camp at night, but in the morning Dave is too weak to travel. The dog-sled moves out without him, and the Scotch half-breed who is in charge goes back and shoots Dave in an act of mercy.
	Analysis
	Buck quickly shows that he is a worthy pack leader, since the dog-team makes the run to Skagway in record time. This makes Franeois and Perrault local celebrities, but it is to Buck that they owe their success.
	Franeois and Perrault then depart from Buck's life for good. They were hard men, but they treated Buck fairly, and he respected them. They are both examples of men who adapted well to their harsh, uncivilized environment. Perrault in particular is described in terms that could also be applied to Buck (""Nothing daunted him""). They show that when men, like the dogs, also revert to a more primitive way of life and behavior, it is possible to do so with honor. Buck's next experience with humans, in chapter 5, will show the other side of the coin.
	The significance of the vision of the cave-man is that Buck is tapping into the collective memory of the species, not his own personal memories. It is this that makes him so quick to adapt to primitive ways of life. Something in him remembers the lives of his ancestors, even though at a personal level all he can remember is his luxurious, easy life at Judge Miller's ranch.

Summary
	After reaching Dawson, the team returns to Skagway. The journey takes one month. The dogs are worn out; Buck has lost twenty-five pounds in weight. Within four days, Buck and his mates are sold to Charles, a middle-aged man, and Hal, a man of about nineteen. Traveling with the men is Mercedes, who is Charles's wife and Hal's sister. Buck's new owners are incompetent, and overload the sled. The dogs are unable to move it. Hal calls them lazy and whips them, although Mercedes tries to persuade him not to. An onlooker suggests that Hal help the dogs by freeing the runners of the sled that are frozen to the snow. When this is done, the dogs are able to pull the sled, but it is so badly loaded it overturns. The owners reluctantly cut the load in half, and acquire six more dogs, making a total of fourteen. The newcomers are not much use, however, and nor does Buck have his heart in the work. He knows he cannot depend on his new masters, because they do not know how to do anything. Progress is very slow, and dog food runs short. Half the food goes when only a quarter of the distance has been covered. One of the dogs, Dub, is injured, and Hal shoots him. Six dogs die of starvation. As the going gets tougher, the three travelers fall to quarreling. Mercedes insists on riding on the sled, which adds intolerably to the load pulled by the weak and starving dogs. Hal, Charles and Mercedes are insensitive to the suffering of the animals. But the seven remaining dogs continue to pull the sled, despite their ill-treatment. One day Billie collapses and cannot continue. Hal kills him with an axe. The next day Koona dies, and only five remain.
	It is spring time, but the travelers are in such a desperate situation they do not notice it. The ice on the river is beginning to break up, but they manage to reach the camp of John Thornton at the mouth of White River. Thornton tells them to take no more chances on the melting ice. Hal refuses to take his advice and wants to continue. But he cannot persuade his exhausted dogs to get up, so he whips them until they begin to move. But Buck refuses. Hal beats him with a club, but Buck has made a decision not to get up. Thornton intervenes, striking Hal, and telling Hal he will kill him if he hits the dog again. Hal draws a knife, but Thornton knocks it out of his hand.
	Hal decides to make off without Buck. They pull out from the bank and start off down the river. After a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks up and the men and dogs are all drowned.
	Analysis
	Charles, Hal and Mercedes are the opposite of the grizzled but efficient Fran�ois and Perrault. They cannot adapt to their new, harsh Arctic environment, as is shown when they overload the sled because they want to take all the trappings of their former, more civilized life-canned goods, blankets, dishes-with them. They consistently exercise bad judgment, so it is natural, according to the law of the survival of the fittest, that they should perish.
	In this episode, London contrasts the civilized and primitive worlds, to the advantage of the latter. The ""civilized"" trio from the south are foolish, petty and endlessly quarrelsome. They are unable to learn and refuse to accept good advice. They degenerate into callous, cruel behavior to their dogs. The more their troubles accumulate, the worse they behave to each other and to their dogs. They know nothing of what London describes as ""the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech and kindly.""
	The episode also illustrates Buck's preternatural instincts in refusing to go on the final, fatal trip. He has a wild animal's instinct for danger. However, he is not yet ready to answer fully the call of the wild. In his state of exhaustion and near starvation, he still needs the nurturing care of a human. This he will find in John Thornton, who rescues him.

537,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 6,"Summary
	Staying with Thornton during the spring, Buck's strength is restored. He plays with Skeet and Nig, Thornton's dogs, and he also loves Thornton, the man who saved his life. He regards Thornton as the ideal master because he looks after his own dogs as if they were his children. Buck adores him, and goes wild with happiness when Thornton touches him or speaks to him. He does not even like to lose sight of Thornton, since he is afraid of losing him.
	In spite of his faithfulness and devotion, however, Buck retains the wildness that has been growing in him since he was first kidnapped. If a strange dog appears, he fights fiercely, and always prevails. He never shows any mercy. He also hears the call of his wild nature, and apart from Thornton, he no longer has any ties to the human world. It is only Thornton that draws him back. No task is too great for Buck to do for his master. He is even prepared to jump over a cliff when Thornton, on a whim, tells him to.
	Later that year, a man named ""Black"" Burton picks a quarrel with Thornton at a bar. Burton hits him, and is immediately attacked by Buck. He barely escapes with his life, and as a result of his defense of his master, Buck gets a reputation through all the camps in Alaska. Later in the year, Buck saves Thornton from drowning in a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty Mile River.
	That winter, Buck's fame spreads even farther throughout Alaska, when he wins a bet that Thornton makes in a bar. The bet is that Buck can start a sled that weighs a thousand pounds. The test takes place in the street outside the bar, and Buck succeeds in his task, breaking the sled out of the ice and pulling it for one hundred yards. This feat of Buck's wins sixteen hundred dollars for his master. A man then offers to buy Buck for twelve hundred dollars, but Thornton is not interested in selling.
	Analysis
	This chapter appears at first to take Buck in a different direction. Up until now, he has been steadily acclimatizing himself to the harsh Arctic environment and reverting to his primitive nature, hearing more and more the call of the wild. Humans mean much less to him than they used to, when he lived on Judge Miller's ranch, and he obeys them only because of the ""law of club,"" that is, the superior power, of man. But now this appears to turn around. With John Thornton, Buck develops a relationship far closer, and more loving, than anything he had known in the civilized world of the Santa Clara Valley. Perhaps the reason London inserted this chapter here is that he wanted to increase the drama of Buck's final rejection of the human world when it takes place in the last chapter. In order to accomplish this, London has to reestablish Buck's links with humans.
	Having said that, it should also be noted that Buck is a completely different dog with Thornton than he was when he was merely Judge Miller's pet, all those years ago. Buck is now a dog who has come in from the wild and chooses for the time being to stay with a human companion, rather than being a pet who has known nothing other than comfort and human kindness. Buck remains tough, merciless, supreme. And Thornton is Buck's last link with the human world. He does not extend his love or his trust to other humans, to whom he is indifferent, even disdainful. He has not returned to the state of innocence he was in at Judge Miller's, when he trustingly allowed Manuel to sell him into slavery. And despite his new attachment to Thornton, the call of the wild gets stronger and stronger within him and the claims of man slip away. For a while he lives as it were in two worlds, but it is only his attachment to Thornton that prevents the wild from claiming him completely.

538,The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 7,"Chapter 7
Summary
	The money Buck wins for him enables Thornton to pay off some debts and journey with his partners in search of a fabled lost gold mine that no living man has ever found. They travel east on an unknown trail. Buck enjoys himself like never before. They journey many months but do not find the lost mine. But they do find gold, in a shallow area in a valley, and they collect as much gold dust and nuggets as they can.
	Buck muses by the fire and has more visions of cave men, and he sees himself wandering with the man. He feels the call of the wild, and sometimes pursues it, spending hours in the forest. ""irresistible impulses"" seize him. He hears a wolf howl, and feels an instant kinship with it. When he sees the wolf, the wolf runs, and Buck follows. When Buck corners it, he does not attack, but makes friendly advances. They continue the chase, and finally sniff noses and become friendly. For hours they run together, and Buck knows he is at last answering the call of the wild. But then he remembers Thornton and returns to the camp. For two days he does not leave, but then he hears once more the call of the forest. He starts to wander in the woods, and stays away from the camp for days at a time, hunting and fishing for his food. He exhibits a wild, wolf-like cunning. As a fearsome hunter, he kills a moose by separating it from the herd and remorselessly pursuing and attacking it. He shows great patience and ferocity. It takes him four days to pull the moose down.
	When he returns to Thornton's camp, he finds it has been overrun by Yeehat Indians. The men and dogs are dead, and the Indians are dancing around the wreckage of the lodge. Buck attacks them and kills several of them. The remainder flee in panic, thinking that an evil spirit has come. Buck discovers that Thornton's body is submerged in a pool.
	At night, Buck hears the yelping of the wolves in the forest, and he finds their call more compelling than ever before. With the death of Thornton, the last of his ties to the human world is gone. When Buck encounters the wolf pack, he kills one of them that attacks him. The other wolves attack him, but Buck positions himself well and fights them off. After half an hour, the wolves back off, and one wolf approaches him in a cautious but friendly manner. It is the wolf Buck has met before. They touch noses. One wolf begins to howl, and the others join in, as does Buck. The pack then runs off, and Buck runs with them.
	For years Buck runs in the wild as a wolf. The Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack, and they are afraid of him. They know he continues on occasion to kill human hunters. They will not enter the valley where he lives.
	Analysis
	Buck continues to hear the call of the wild, and hears it more strongly than ever. From the moment he meets the wolf, and makes friends with him, he exists in two worlds and two communities: the human one, and the wolf community that he is discovering in his ""wild brother.""
	Perhaps because London wanted to emphasize the depth of Buck's attachment to Thornton, and distinguish it from the former relationship between Buck and Judge Miller, he gives to Buck a second vision of the cave-man, but this time the cave-man is accompanied by Buck. The tie between man and dog, it is implied, goes back to the dawn of the human race, when man, at the mercy of wild beasts, needed dogs for protection. Thus the relationship between Thornton and Buck is as much a product of primitive roots as civilized ones.
	The death of Thornton severs the last ties Buck has to the human world. He now becomes completely wild, running with the pack and establishing his mastery through strength and cunning. He is the living example of the Darwinian law of the survival of the fittest. But London does not present this as a regression to be regretted. Buck has in fact triumphed. He has discovered for himself the ancient springs of his own nature, and is more fully himself than when he was cozy and enjoying himself on the ranch at Judge Miller's, or lazing around the fire at John Thornton's. He is fulfilling the deepest impulses of his own being, and in doing so he acquires an almost mythic status as the Ghost Dog or Evil Spirit of Indian legend.

539,Phaedo: Novel Summary,"
Summary
The Phaedo begins when Echecrates asks Phaedo to tell him about Socrates' death, and Phaedo warmly welcomes the chance to remember his friend Socrates in the final hours of his life.  He says that it was an astonishing experience because although he was witnessing the death of a dear friend, he had no pity because of the way in which Socrates bravely and happily faced it, unafraid of the unknown.  He takes care to mention that Plato was not there due to illness and further explains the course of the day to Echecrates. 
	In the days prior to Socrates' death, Phaedo and other friends frequently visited Socrates in jail.  Each time they discuss something new and interesting, including Socrates' thoughts on why it is wrong to kill one's self.  Socrates thinks that it shows disrespect to the gods when one chooses to commit suicide because men are possessions of the gods and the gods are right to be angry if one of their possessions kills himself.  He believes that only after the gods make it necessary (as his situation is of necessity, for example) is it permissible to choose death over life.  And Cebes thinks that what Socrates has said doesn't make sense because the wise should always want to be with better people than himself so he can learn from them, as philosophers want to do.  If one dies, one will not be with wiser people anymore and so the wise should resent death while the foolish should rejoice at it.  Socrates then tries to defend his argument by showing Cebes and Simmias that if death is the separation of the soul from the body, the philosopher by being a philosopher seeks to have himself separated as much as possible from his body (because the body inhibits the mind).  And therefore, the philosopher practices death everyday in his life.  So the philosopher, as an example of ""the wise"" would not resent death as Cebes originally thought.
	The men then take up discussion on what exactly death is, and Socrates tells us a lot of the qualities of the soul in the opinion of Plato.  He says that the soul is capable of reasoning and thought, and that those capacities alone can grasp relevant objects, so he believes that no thought at all can be reached through the senses of the body.  This is why Plato was considered to be an a priori philosopher, which means that he thought knowledge could be attained completely independent of experience.  This is a comforting thought for someone like Socrates who is close to death.  If he cares about knowledge (which we know that he does) he certainly has no cause to fear dying since it will in his belief, free his soul from his body so it can better learn and move closer to knowledge. 
	A little later in the text, Cebes tells Socrates that everything he has said so far has been excellent.  But, ""I think, men find it hard to believe what you said about the soul.  They think that after it has left the body it no longer exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the day the man dies,"".  He asks Socrates to speak a little to this fact and Socrates accepts the challenge, beginning by a discussion on the immortality of the soul. 
	There are two arguments that Socrates relies on to support his claim.  They are the following:
	1a) Argument from recollection
	1b) Argument from affinity
	The first argument means that the soul existed before birth, and as Socrates explains, it was then that the soul learned all that it could learn from the Forms.  The Forms are discussed at length in Plato's Republic, but in summary they are intangible, divine, perfect, ideals of things such as Beauty, Good, Truth, etc. and all things in the world derive their existence and identity from the Forms.  At birth, all that was previously learned is forgotten and that is why we start out knowing so little, if anything at all.  We grow in life and learn more and more by ""recollecting"" our prior knowledge, until we can arrive at true belief which is one step below knowledge.  Only in death can we again arrive at the knowledge that we possessed before birth, when our souls were communing with the Forms, as they are again in death.
	The second part of the first argument is that our souls exist after death.  Socrates attempts to show this to be true by indirectly constructing a logical proof.  Assume that opposites come from opposites.  For example, wake comes from sleep.  Then assume that life is the opposite of death.  We can then conclude that life comes from death.  Secondly, assume that one existed before some time ""x"".  Then assume that one's body did not exist before some time ""x"".  We can then conclude that one does not equal one's body.  And this gives support to the claim that our soul and body are two different entities.  If you combine both of these proofs with the other assumptions that Socrates gives, namely that before life one's body did not exist, yet one did exist before life, so one is either one's soul or body and since the body clearly dies after death we must be our souls, which means that we were dead souls before we were alive.  This proves to Simmias and Cebes that the soul exists after death, and therefore the soul must be immortal.
	The second argument that Socrates makes is for the existence of the Forms.  This argument is not quite as clear, but Socrates thinks that when the soul abandons the body in death it passes on into a realm of intangible, divine, perfect, ideals that describe the Forms.  Although he never uses the term ""Forms"" we can assume that this was what Plato was trying to convey based on textual evidence in other works. 
	After satisfying his friends with the previous discussion, Socrates talks at length about the different kinds of souls that different people have.  The philosophers soul is in the most desirable state because philosophers spend their lives contemplating the Forms and by doing this they gain wisdom, much more so than the average man or woman.  They are compelled as Socrates says, by the pursuit of wisdom, and therefore try to rely only on their minds since the body and senses can be deceiving.  At some point in the conversation, Simmias and Cebes admit that they still have some doubt about whether one can have knowledge about what happens to the soul after it separates from the body, as in death.  Socrates is pleased to hear that his friends need more clarification because he knows that shortly he will be apart from them, and their conversation is more valuable now than ever. 
	Simmias says that the previously mentioned problem is analogous to a lyre and its harmony.  If the lyre is the tangible matter, similar to the body, then the harmony is the intangible perfect music similar to the soul.  He wonders what happens to the music when someone breaks the lyre and Socrates answers that the soul is actually not analogous to the harmony because harmony cannot exist prior to the things from which it was created from, and that goes against the entire argument that the soul did indeed exist before the body, which Simmias previously agreed.  Socrates further explains that the Forms of the Good and Beautiful, etc. are causes of things, and that the soul is immortal.  Beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty.  That is, a statue of Helen of Troy is considered beautiful by people because it derives its beautiful qualities from the Form of Beauty. 
	Socrates then uses Simmias as an example to introduce the idea of ""carriers"".  If Simmias is both taller than Socrates but shorter than Phaedo, then be exhibits both tallness and shortness.  The problem is that tallness is obviously not the same as shortness and it cannot be both tall and short as in the case of Simmias' tallness.  If one quality won't admit of another then it either flees when its opposite is present or is destroyed by its opposite.  ""Carriers"" are things that share the same properties of qualities as in the example of fire and heat.  Heat will not admit of cold (because they are opposites) just as fire will not admit of water.  Fire and water are carriers of heat and cold, respectively.  All of this is analogous to the soul according to Socrates.  He thinks now that he has adequately proven that the soul is that which makes the body live, so it can't admit of death.  Therefore the soul is deathless, or immortal. 
	The Phaedo ends with a Socrates saying that since the soul is immortal, it requires our care in life by being good so that we may fare well in death.  He believes, or rather it is more appropriate to say that Plato believes that your life in the underworld and in the next life depends on the state of your soul.  Obviously philosophers were considered by Plato to have the best souls because they spent their lives in search of knowledge and therefore they can make better choices and have a better chance of choosing a good life, all because of the knowledge that they acquired and the way in which they lived their lives. 
	Finally, Socrates drinks the hemlock and his friends become quite upset.  Socrates scolds them slightly and says that he sent the women away for fear of them reacting with tears.  Phaedo says that he felt ashamed for crying when Socrates was so dignified, and then the great philosopher and man took his last breath of air before dying.  Those who knew him held him best held him in such high regard at the very end of his life, and at perhaps the most poignant time in his life-his death.

	The first chapter of Hard Times takes place in a schoolroom. Mr. Gradgrind explains that children should be taught only facts. In the next chapter, he calls on Sissy Jupe to give him a definition of a horse. She cannot do so, but a boy in the class, Bitzer, defines a horse to the satisfaction of Gradgrind. Another of the adults in the room, a government officer, now takes over the teaching. He asks the girls and boys whether they would paper a room with representations of horses. He makes it clear that the correct answer is no. He explains that it would be incorrect to do so, because in real life horses do not walk up and down a wall. For the same reason, he tells the children that they would not carpet a room with representations of flowers, even though Sissy disagrees. Everything, says the gentleman, must be regulated by Fact. They must discard Fancy altogether. Gradgrind then hands over the lesson to the schoolteacher, M'Choakumchild, who proceeds, we are led to believe, to fill up the children with a lot of Facts.
	In chapter 3, Gradgrind walks home from school he passes by a circus, set up in a wooden pavilion. He disapproves of such entertainments and walks on past it, but the turn of the road takes him past the back of the circus booth. There, to his annoyance, he finds two of his children, Louisa and Thomas, peeping in. He rebukes them and leads them back home.
	Chapter 4 introduces Mr. Bounderby, the rich banker. He is at Stone Lodge, Gradgrind's home, talking to Mrs. Gradgrind, boasting, as he often does, about his deprived and wretched childhood. He says he was abandoned by his mother and raised by his grandmother, who was a drunkard. The point of his story is to bring great credit upon himself for overcoming such a bad start in life.
	Gradgrind and the children come home, and the children endure more reproaches for showing an interest in the circus. Mrs. Gradgrind banishes them to their studies. Gradgrind and Bounderby discuss why how children might have been misled. They conclude it is because Sissy Jupe is the daughter of circus folk, and she attends the same school as Gradgrind's children. They decide to pay Sissy's father a visit.
	Analysis
	The first chapters introduce one of the main themes of the novel, the contrast between Facts and Fancy, and the one-sidedness of the educational philosophy espoused by Gradgrind. He believes that all knowledge worth having must have a practical value, and to this end he trusts only in the rational intellect. Matters of the heart do not affect him; he dismisses imagination and entertainment as worthless, with no place in a child's education.
	In taking satirical aim at Gradgrind, Dickens was giving expression to his belief that the schools in England were doing a poor job of educating the whole child. In other of his writings of this period, Dickens complained that there was too much emphasis on cramming the children full of facts and figures.
	Dickens wrote Hard Times in 1854, at a time when there was an awareness in society of the need to make education more widely available and to improve the quality of schools. During the 1850s, the British government had established the first training colleges for schoolteachers. M'Choakumchild, another object of Dickens's biting satire, is obviously intended to be a graduate of one of these new training colleges. The message is clear: such teachers may have a lot of knowledge at their disposal (too much, according to Dickens), but if they look upon children simply as empty vessels waiting to be filled up with information, the results are going to be disappointing.
	The disastrous effect of such an educational system can already be seen in Louisa. As she is described in chapter 3, there is a dissatisfaction in her face, "" a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination keeping a life in itself somehow.""

	Chapters 5-8
	Coketown is described as an industrial town marked by a stultifying conformity. The streets and buildings all look alike, and the people all follow the same routines. The red brick houses are all dirty from the smoke that belches from the many factories. Gradgrind and Bounderby walk down the street, trying to find out where Sissy's father lives. Then Sissy comes running by, chased by Bitzer, and Sissy shows them the way. She leads them down a narrow road to a small, shabby tavern called the Pegasus Arms. Her family lives upstairs. Her father is not there, however. Sissy goes to find him. Bounderby and Gradgrind meet E. W. B. Childers, one of the circus performers who is known for his daring acts on horseback, and Childers's assistant, a young man named Kidderminster. Childers informs his visitors that Sissy's father, troubled by his poor performances in the circus, has left her and will not return. He has not provided anything for his daughter. Sleary, the circus owner then appears. Taking pity on the deserted Sissy, Gradgrind offers her the chance to live in his house, and continue to attend the school, as long as she agrees never to communicate with any of the circus folk again. Sissy agrees because she knows, and is reminded by Sleary, that her father wanted her to have an education. She believes that her father will one day return.
	Chapter 7 introduces Mrs. Sparsit, Bounderby's elderly housekeeper. Bounderby is discussing with her the matter of Gradgrind's decision to take in Sissy Jupe. Bounderby does not approve of it, and has taken Sissy in for a night so that Gradgrind might have more time to consider. He feels that Sissy will not be a good influence on Louisa. Gradgrind arrives with Louisa, and Sissy is sent for. Gradgrind confirms that he will take Sissy in to his house, and she will attend the school. When she is not at school, she will help Mrs. Gradgrind, who is something of an invalid.
	In chapter 8, Tom Gradgrind complains to his sister about how much he hates his life. He hates the kind of education he is receiving. Louisa regrets that she cannot do more to cheer him up, but Tom acknowledges that she is the only pleasure he has. He resolves that when he leaves home and is apprenticed to Bounderby, he will find a way of enjoying himself. He thinks he knows how to handle Bounderby by playing on the affections Bounderby has for Louisa. Louisa gazes into the fire and wonders what the future holds for them both, only to be reproached by her mother, who entered the room unheard, for indulging in wonder, which her father has forbidden her to do.
	Analysis
	Chapter 5 introduces another major theme of the novel, the disastrous effects of industrialism. The description of Coketown, actually based on conditions in Manchester in the mid-nineteenth century, emphasizes the conformity and the narrowness of people's lives. The city is noisy, polluted, unnatural.
	The circus folk are the antithesis of Bounderby and Gradgrind. Not only are they more warm-hearted than the two ""eminently practical"" men, they also represent fancy, as opposed to fact. Significantly, they live above a tavern (public house, or ""pub"" in English terminology) called The Pegasus Arms. Pegasus, the winged, flying horse from Greek mythology is pictured on the sign-board of the pub. Inside, there is a framed portrait of one of the circus horses, ""with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk."" He is described as ""another Pegasus."" The fact that the circus riders perform incredible feats on their ""flying"" horses can be set against the incident in chapter 1, in which the schoolchildren were told they should not paper walls with depictions of horses, since horses do not climb walls. But the circus horses, so skillfully handled by their riders, show that the merely factual description of a horse approved by Gradgrind conveys nothing of how the circus horses appeal to people's sense of wonder. This sense of wonder is something that mere facts and figures can never supply.

	Sissy struggles at school, failing to master all the facts and figures that are thrown at her by Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild. She thinks she is stupid. However, her conversations with Louisa about her education reveal that she is not stupid at all. But she looks at everything from the point of view of the heart, and this does not suit her well to the type of education she is receiving. She stays on at the school only because she knows her father wanted her to have an education. She still believes that one day he will return. Sissy confides in Louisa and tells her stories about her father. A friendship begins to grow between them.
	Chapter10 introduces Stephen Blackpool, a hard-working factory hand. After work one evening he walks his long-time lady friend Rachel home. Then he returns to his own lodgings, which consists of a single room above a shop. When he lights the candle he discovers that his drunken wife, having apparently been gone for some while, has returned. Stephen is appalled. It is clear that there is no love between them.
	The next day at noon, Stephen walks to Bounderby's house and requests an interview with Bounderby. Bounderby has a generally low opinion of the factory hands, but he has a reasonably good impression of Stephen. Stephen asks Bounderby's advice. He has been married to his wife for nineteen years, but soon after they married she ""went bad,"" meaning that she took to drink. He was patient with her, but on many occasions she would sell everything he owned to keep herself in drink. She left him several times but always came back. He tried paying her to stay away. But now she has returned. He tells Bounderby that he cannot stand it any more and wants to be rid of her. Bounderby is unsympathetic. He tells Stephen that marriage is a sacred bond and he must live with the situation. Stephen persists. He knows that rich people can get divorced, and wants to know if he can too. Bounderby replies that a divorce would cost him much more than he could afford, and the procedure is complicated. Stephen complains that everything is a muddle, which angers Bounderby, who begins to lose his earlier favorable impression of the man.
	After he leaves Bounderby, Stephen encounters an old woman who makes a lot of inquiries about Bounderby, but does not explain why she wants to know about him. She says she has traveled forty miles to see him. Now she must go back without even having caught a glimpse of him.
	After leaving the factory in the afternoon, Stephen waits for Rachel but she does not come. He thinks regretfully of the future they will never have together.
	Analysis
	Stephen Blackpool is introduced into the story to show the essential decency of the working man, as opposed to the callous indifference and stupidity of men such as Bounderby and Gradgrind.
	Dickens's purpose in describing Stephen's bad marriage was to attack England's restrictive divorce laws. What Bounderby tells Stephen is accurate. It was almost impossible at the time for a man of Stephen Blackpool's limited means to get a divorce. Divorce was available only for the wealthy. During the 1850s there was considerable pressure on the government for a change in the divorce laws. Dickens contributed to the debate not only in Hard Times but also in articles he wrote in his magazine, Household Words. In 1857, a few years after Hard Times was published, a Divorce Act was passed by the British parliament. The intention was to make divorce more easily available. However, although the number of reasons for which a divorce could be granted were increased, in practice there was still one law for the rich and another for the poor.

	Stephen returns home, to find Rachel attending his sick and injured wife. Rachel is trying to do what little she can for her. She says she will stay until three o'clock in the morning. Stephen sees a bottle of medicine that Rachel is applying to the woman's wound. He shudders because he knows that the medicine is poisonous if drunk. Then on Rachel's suggestion, he sits in his chair and falls asleep. When he wakes up he sees Rachel dozing on another chair. He also sees his wife reaching out a hand for the medicine table. She is about to drink the deadly poison when Rachel wakes up, realizes what is happening, and wrests the bottle from the woman's hand. It is now three o'clock, and Rachel leaves. Stephen feels extremely grateful for her saintliness and all she does for him.
	A few years go by. Gradgrind tells Sissy that there is no point in her continuing at the school, but he allows her to continue to live with the family as general helper. Young Tom Gradgrind is apprenticed to Bounderby and moves to his house. Mr. Gradgrind gets elected as Member of Parliament for Coketown.
	Gradgrind informs Louisa that Bounderby has made a proposal of marriage to her. Although Bounderby is fifty years old and Louisa only twenty, Gradgrind clearly wants Louisa to accept the proposal. He asks her to consider the matter in a wholly practical manner, just as she has been trained to do everything else. Although she has no love for Bounderby, Louisa decides to accept his proposal. She does so in part because she wants to please her brother Tom. Tom knew what was coming and hinted to her that she should accept, because then they would be living in the same house, and he would like that.
	Bounderby is anxious about how Mrs. Sparsit, his housekeeper, will take the news of his forthcoming marriage. But she accepts it with equanimity and wishes him great happiness. In reality, she pities him. Bounderby knows that Mrs. Sparsit will not wish to remain living in the house now that he is to marry, so he offers her a private apartment at the Bank. He will also grant her an annual allowance. She accepts his offer.
	After an eight-week engagement, Bounderby and Louisa marry.
	Analysis
	Dickens rarely lets up in his satire on the utilitarian philosophy, with its emphasis on practicality and facts. No hint of romance is permitted to intrude itself on the engagement and marriage of Bounderby and Louisa.
	Gradgrind, for example dismisses the problem of the disparity between the ages of Louisa and Bounderby by the use of statistics. He reports that a large proportion of marriages in England and Wales are made between people of very different ages, and in more than three out of four cases, the elder party is the man. For Gradgrind, that settles the matter.
	The wedding is an entirely practical affair. All the preparations for it take on, as Dickens puts it, ""a manufacturing aspect."" As befits the manufacturing town of Coketown, things are made in honor of the occasion: dresses, jewelry, cakes, gloves. There is no poetic talk about time flying or slowing down. Time in Coketown always passes with monotonous regularity. The wedding day comes ""as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason.""
	Gradgrind and Bounderby are too obtuse to notice it, but Louisa's spirit is already broken by the restricted education she has received. She has never been allowed to flourish emotionally or imaginatively, or in any way other than the strictly practical. Dickens creates a telling image of her when she speaks to her father about her lack of experience in anything other than ""problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be grasped."" As she says this, ""she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or ash."" Louisa has a habit of gazing into the fire to stimulate her imagination; the image here of emptiness and ashes show how her inner life has withered or been burnt up until it hardly exists any more.

Book the Second: Reaping
	Chapters 1-4
	It is a sunny summer's afternoon about a year later. Bitzer, the bank porter, brings Mrs. Sparsit's tea to her apartment. (Bitzer is the boy who was in Sissy's class at school, and who gave the factual definition of a horse that pleased Gradgrind.) In addition to his duties as porter, Bitzer also acts as spy and informant for the bosses. He reports to Mrs. Sparsit that Tom Gradgrind, who is now a junior employee of the bank, is lazy and extravagant with money. Bitzer comments that most of the workers in the town are like that, and he carefully distances himself from them, emphasizing how prudent he is in saving money. These are sentiments with which Mrs. Sparsit heartily agrees.
	A stranger, a gentleman, arrives to see Mrs. Sparsit. The visitor is Mr. James Harthouse, and he has a letter of introduction from Gradgrind in London to Bounderby. He inquires of Mrs. Sparsit where Bounderby lives, and as they chat, he asks her about Louisa Bounderby. He has heard alarming reports about her as being hard-headed and unapproachable. He is surprised when Mrs. Sparsit informs him that Louisa is young; he had imagined her to be much older. After Harthouse leaves, Mrs. Sparsit spends a long time in contemplation. But she does not reveal her thoughts.
	It turns out that Harthouse has been recruited by Gradgrind and his friends in the ""hard facts"" school. They have sent him to Coketown so that he can become known there and in the neighborhood. Harthouse is not a true believer, however. He is a young gentleman who became bored with his leisurely life of traveling around the world and decided to do something else instead. It was convenient for him to get adopted by Gradgrind and his party, but he has no serious interest in their philosophy.
	Harthouse meets Bounderby, who gives him an absurd picture of how healthy a place Coketown is: the smoke is good for the lungs, the mills are pleasant places to work in, and the jobs pay well too. Bounderby then introduces Harthouse to Louisa. Harthouse confides in her that he accepts Bounderby's opinions simply because one set of opinions is as good, or as bad, as any other. But he is quite prepared to act as if he did believe in them. At dinner, Harthouse is bored by Bounderby's conversation, but is intrigued by Louisa. He realizes she does not love Bounderby, but he notices her affection for her brother Tom. Thinking that the way to make an impression on Louisa is through her brother, he shows a liking for him.
	That evening, Tom accompanies Harthouse back to his hotel. He is flattered by the friendship Harthouse is extending to him. Tom confirms Harthouse's impression that Louisa does not care for her husband. Tom adds that Louisa married Bounderby just to please her brother. He, Tom, had wanted the marriage because he didn't want Louisa to offend Bounderby, thinking this might have adverse consequences for himself, given that he was an employee at Bounderby's bank.
	It is late at night before Tom leaves the hotel. He has unwittingly supplied Harthouse with enough information about Louisa to give Harthouse ideas about how to approach her romantically.
	The scene switches in chapter 4 to a meeting of the factory hands' union. A union organizer named Slackbridge gives a fiery speech, telling the men they must unite to defeat their oppressors. Then he denounces Stephen Blackpool, calling him a traitor for refusing to join the union. Stephen rises to defend himself. He says he cannot support the proposed regulations that the union is promoting at the mill. He says they will not do the workers any good, although he does not explain why. However, he adds that this is not the reason he is not supporting the union. He has other reasons, although he does not elaborate on what they might be.
	Stephen leaves the meeting knowing that he is likely to be shunned by everyone in the union. This is indeed what happens. He is ""sent to Coventry,"" which means that no one will speak to him or even acknowledge his presence. After four days of this treatment, Stephen is summoned to a meeting with Bounderby.
	Analysis
	The second book, appropriately called ""Reaping,"" begins to show the dismal results of the Gradgrind educational philosophy. Bitzer has learned his lessons well and is ready to rise in the world. But Dickens does not intend this as a compliment to Bitzer. Bitzer shows promise only because he always acts from cold calculation, which Mrs. Sparsit mistakes as ""principle."" Bitzer is a very unpleasant young man, whose principal achievement so far appears to have been to get his mother confined to the workhouse (where the poor were sent to work for their keep).
	Unlike Bitzer, Tom Gradgrind has not absorbed any lessons from his education. But he does not reject the ""hard facts"" philosophy in favor of something better. He has no knowledge of anything better, so his life simply falls quickly into ruin.
	The devastating effects of Louisa's restricted upbringing and education are already apparent in her loveless marriage to Bounderby. But Dickens has more in store for her, and that is why he introduces Harthouse into the story. The amoral Harthouse cares little for anybody or anything, and is only out to amuse himself. When he sets his sights on Louisa, it is obvious that the outcome will be bad.
	Stephen Blackpool is included as a contrast. He and Rachel are the only couple in the book who have a genuine, steadfast love for each other.

Book the Second: Reaping
	Chapters 5-8
	Bounderby asks Stephen about what has happened between him and the other men. Stephen replies that he has nothing to say about it. Bounderby asks him directly why he refuses to join the union, but all Stephen will say is that he gave a promise (to Rachel, as will be revealed in the next chapter). Bounderby makes disparaging remarks about the union officials and the working men, but Stephen defends them, addressing Louisa rather than Bounderby. Then Bounderby asks him what the men in general complain about. Stephen replies in a matter-of-fact kind of way, explaining about the poor living and working conditions the people endure. He also points out that the bosses think they are always right and the workers always wrong. When Bounderby asks him how he would remedy the situation, Stephen says it will do no good to prosecute the union leaders, as Bounderby threatens. Stephen refuses to speak ill of the men who have rejected him. He does not pretend to know how relations between employers and employees can be improved. But he does explain what will not work, and that includes treating people as if they were soulless machines. Bounderby objects to Stephen's words, calls him a complainer, and then fires him. Stephen knows this means he will not be able to obtain work elsewhere.
	When he leaves Bounderby's, Stephen meets Rachel in the street. She is accompanied by the mysterious old woman whom Stephen met earlier (Book 1, chapter 12). The old woman has been waiting outside Bounderby's house in order to catch a glimpse of his wife. Stephen tells Rachel he has been fired, and that he plans to leave Coketown, although he does not know where he will go. They all go to Stephen's lodgings for tea. His wife has been gone for months.
	The old woman's name is Mrs. Pegler. She says she is a widow, and that she has a son, but she will say nothing about him. At that moment, Louisa arrives, accompanied by Tom. Louisa wants to help Stephen. Stephen says that he plans to leave Coketown on foot and seek employment elsewhere. Louisa offers him some money, and he accepts two pounds, a smaller sum than she offered. When Louisa is about to leave, Tom takes Stephen aside, saying he may be able to help him. He tells Stephen to hang around outside the bank for an hour in the evenings before he departs. Tom may be able to do him a good turn, and if he can, he will send Bitzer to him with a message. Stephen waits each evening for three days outside the bank. But he receives no message. He leaves town on foot on a summer morning.
	For his own amusement, Harthouse pursues Louisa, trying to get her to fall in love with him. In the woods near Bounderby's country house, fifteen miles from town, Harthouse engages Louisa in conversation by pretending an interest in her brother Tom. He tells her that Tom probably has gambling debts, and he, Harthouse, wishes to help him. Louisa admits that she knows of the problem, and has lent Tom money. Harthouse then says that his aim is to get Tom to behave better towards his sister.
	Harthouse sees Tom in the distance and they go to meet him. Tom is in a depressed mood. After Louisa goes into the house, Tom confesses to Harthouse that he is in a financial mess. He resents his sister for not giving him more money, which he believes she could easily obtain from her husband. Harthouse offers to advise Tom on how he can get out of debt, and asks in return that Tom be more loving towards his sister. Tom readily agrees.
	Bounderby breaks the news to Harthouse that the bank has been robbed. The amount stolen amounts to no more than a hundred and fifty pounds. It was stolen from Tom's safe. Stephen Blackpool is suspected of the crime, since he was seen hanging around the bank at night. The old woman is also suspected of being involved.
	Tom, who has been helping the police, returns late at night. Louisa, who suspects he may have had something to do with the robbery, asks him if he has anything to say to her. Tom says he does not know what she is talking about.
	Analysis
	Critics of Hard Times often say that the characterization is not as strong as in Dickens's other novels. Chapter 5 presents some evidence for that view. Bounderby's behavior is so outrageously bad that it strains credulity. And conversely, Stephen, both in this chapter and throughout, is so unfailingly good that it is hard to believe in him as a real person. Readers must make up their own minds about whether these characters come across as believable, or whether Dickens's desire to present workers in the best possible light and employers in the worst possible light has blunted his instincts as a writer.
	It is also sometimes pointed out that although Dickens is savage in his criticism of industrialism and industrial relations, he offers no solution to the problem. There may be some truth in this, but Stephen's long speech to Bounderby, in which he explains everything that will not work, contains within it the germ of a new approach. It is a call to end the divisive, confrontational attitude to employer-employee relations, in which there must always be a victor and a vanquished. It is also a rejection of the ""laissez-faire"" economic philosophy of the utilitarians, what Stephen calls ""lettin alone."" This was a philosophy of complete economic freedom that allowed market forces to govern industry, without any regulation by government. Laissez-faire economics resulted in dangerous working conditions, low pay, and the other ills suffered by the factory workers in Hard Times.

	Chapters 9-12
	Mrs. Sparsit shows great interest in Harthouse's attempts to get to know Louisa. She also shows great solicitude to Bounderby, which has the effect of alienating him from his wife, and pushing Louisa closer to Harthouse. This is an effect that Mrs. Sparsit intends, since she has goodwill neither to Bounderby nor his wife.
	Louisa returns to Stone Lodge, her father's home, to attend to her mother at the old woman's death.
	Following the bank robbery, Mrs. Sparsit stays temporarily at Bounderby's country house. She takes pleasure in contemplating what she anticipates will be Louisa's fall. She observes Louisa and Harthouse from her window, talking together in the garden, and she continues to observe them day by day as their relationship develops.
	When Bounderby goes away on business for a few days, Mrs. Sparsit spies on Louisa and Harthouse, who are alone together at Bounderby's country house. Mrs. Sparsit believes that Harthouse has deliberately arranged for Tom to be out of the house. She eavesdrops on the conversation between Louisa and Harthouse, listening as Harthouse tries to arrange a place for the two of them to meet in private, since Louisa has not welcomed him to the house. Putting his arm around her, he declares that he loves her.
	When it starts to rain, Louisa goes into the house, soon to reemerge and leave. Mrs. Sparsit assumes Louisa is going to a secret meeting somewhere with Harthouse, and she follows her. Louisa takes a train to Coketown and Mrs. Sparsit does likewise. She expects that Louisa will wait for Harthouse, who will be riding back to Coketown on his horse. But at the railway station Mrs. Sparsit loses track of Louisa.
	Louisa arrives at her father's house. Gradgrind is at home, since parliament is on vacation. Louisa pours out her feelings to him. She expresses regrets for the narrow way in which she was raised, without being allowed to cultivate any of the emotions, feelings or sensibilities that would have made her life worth living. She confesses that she hates her husband. Gradgrind is distressed at her words, since he had no idea that she was so unhappy. Louisa then confesses that she may be in love with Harthouse, although since she is inexperienced in such matters, she does not know for sure. She tells her father that Harthouse is expecting her at that very moment. She agreed to go somewhere to meet him because that was the only way she could get out of his presence. She begs her father to save her. Then she faints, falling at his feet.
	Analysis
	This section is dominated by the crisis into which Louisa sinks, for which Dickens has been carefully laying the groundwork since the start of Book Two. The cause of the predicament in which Louisa finds herself is clear from the explanations she gives to her father, even though she does not wish to blame him. Everything goes back to the narrow principles on which she was raised. This upbringing has blighted her life and now everything has come to a head. It was probably inevitable that at some point in Louisa's life, someone would come along who would speak to the emptiness inside her and call up long buried dreams and emotions.
	The incident in which Louisa confesses everything to her father is also the start of Gradgrind's rehabilitation. He must be given credit for the receptive, sympathetic way he listens to Louisa. From the beginning of the novel, Gradgrind has been presented as a less hard man than Bounderby. He is not unkind. His mistake was to adopt a foolish set of principles to live by.

	In the morning, Louisa receives visits from her younger sister Jane, and then from her father. Gradgrind is devastated by what Louisa told him the previous evening. It seems to him as if the whole foundation of his life, the system on which he lived, has been swept away. He assures his daughter that he had meant to do right, but now he mistrusts his own ability to help her. After Gradgrind leaves, Louisa is visited by Sissy. The two women rekindle their friendship, which had gone cold after Louisa married Bounderby.
	Harthouse is agitated by Louisa's failure to turn up at his hotel. The next day he tries to find out where she is, without success. Then Sissy comes to visit him. She tells him that he has no chance of ever seeing Louisa again, although she emphasizes that Louisa has not sent her to say this. She also tells him that he must leave Coketown immediately and never return, since that is the only way he can mitigate the harm he has done. Harthouse admits he is to blame for the situation and reluctantly accedes to Sissy's request. He leaves Coketown later that day.
	Mrs. Sparsit has told Bounderby about the conversation she overheard between Louisa and Harthouse, and he takes her immediately to see Gradgrind. But Gradgrind says he already knows the story, and hastens to add that Louisa came straight to him for protection. Bounderby rebukes Mrs. Sparsit and sends her back to the bank. Gradgrind tells Bounderby that he would like Louisa to stay with him, Gradgrind, for a while, attended by Sissy. Bounderby is furious and says, among other things, that Louisa does not appreciate his merits. Gradgrind tries to speak to Bounderby in a reasonable tone, asking that he cooperate in helping Louisa to recover, but Bounderby gets more and more angry. Eventually he issues an ultimatum: unless Louisa returns to his house by noon the next day, he will assume that she prefers to remain at her father's, and he will send her belongings along. The next day, since Louisa has not returned, he does exactly what he promised. He then puts his country house up for sale and resumes a bachelor life.
	Bounderby offers a reward for the arrest of Stephen Blackpool in connection with the bank robbery. Posters are put all around Coketown to this effect. Slackbridge, the union delegate, uses this to once more denounce Stephen at a meeting. Meanwhile, Bounderby, Tom and Rachel go to see Louisa. Rachel gets Louisa to confirm that she, Louisa, visited Stephen before his departure and gave him money. Bounderby had disbelieved Rachel's story about this but is now forced to acknowledge its truth. Rachel says she has written to Stephen, and she expects him to return to Coketown within two days to clear his name. After the visitors have gone, Louisa tells her father that she believes Stephen to be innocent.
	Over a week passes, but Stephen does not return. No one knows of his whereabouts.
	Analysis
	As Gradgrind continues to soften, and to see the inadequacy of the principles of reason he has lived by, he succinctly expresses one of the main themes of the novel. The moment comes when he tells Louisa in the first chapter of book 3, ""Some persons hold. . . that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart."" Up to this point, he has not believed this to be true; he had thought the head sufficient, but now he knows that it may not be.
	In these chapters, Sissy, who knows the wisdom of the heart, emerges as probably the strongest, most balanced of the characters in Gradgrind's world. She seems to have been able to resist the bad influence of the education she received and the emotionally stifled atmosphere of the Gradgrind home. She is naturally connected to the values of the heart. It is this that gives her the strength to confront Harthouse and insist that he comply with her wishes.

	Rachel confesses to Sissy that she thinks someone may have deliberately prevented Stephen from returning to proclaim his innocence. She even fears that he may have been murdered. As the two women walk together in the street, an excited Mrs. Sparsit alights from a coach with an unwilling Mrs. Pegler. Mrs. Sparsit insists on taking the old woman to Bounderby.
	Rachel, Sissy, Gradgrind, Tom, Mrs. Sparsit and Mrs. Pegler gather in Bounderby's dining room. Bounderby is extremely discomfited by the sight of Mrs. Pegler, who turns out to be his mother. Mrs. Pegler sets the story straight about Bounderby's early years. She did not desert him, as he has always claimed. She looked after him as well as she could, bearing in mind that his father died when he was eight. She skimped on her own needs and managed to apprentice her son to a kind master. Bounderby has been paying her a small allowance all these years in exchange for a promise that she will stay away from him. Bounderby refuses to explain his family affairs to the gathered company, and asks them to leave. But he is humbled by the disclosure that he has lied about his past.
	On a bright Sunday in autumn, Sissy and Rachel take a train a few miles out of Coketown and walk in the country. They have not been walking long when they find a hat lying in the grass. It belongs to Stephen. Nearby, they almost fall down a concealed, disused mine shaft. They realize that Stephen must have fallen down it, and they call down for him, but there is no reply. They run to get help. Soon a group of men from the nearest village arrives. It takes four hours before a machine is rigged up in which two men are lowered into the mine shaft. A crowd of over a hundred, including Louisa, Gradgrind and Bounderby, looks on. One man returns to the surface and reports that Stephen is alive but badly injured. Apparently he was walking back to Coketown when, in the dark, he fell down the shaft. It is dark before Stephen can be brought to the surface. He speaks to Rachel and then asks Gradgrind to clear his name by asking Tom about the matter. Stephen dies as the men carry him across the fields and down the lanes.
	Tom goes missing. Gradgrind and Louisa both suspect he is guilty of the robbery and that he deliberately cast suspicion on Stephen Blackpool. Sissy explains that Tom, on her advice, has taken refuge with the circus folk, in a town three hours away from the port city of Liverpool. They make the journey, Gradgrind traveling separately. He plans to have Tom sent to America. Louisa and Sissy arrive first and meet Sleary in the circus booth. All the circus people crowd around Sissy, whom they have not seen for many years. Tom is dressed up as in a comic outfit as a black servant. Later, when Gradgrind arrives, Tom tells of how he carried out the robbery. Sleary plans to send Tom by coach, and then by rail, to Liverpool. Tom, who has harsh words for his sister, is about to depart when Bitzer arrives and grabs him.
	Gradgrind pleads with Bitzer not to take Tom back to Coketown. But Bitzer is determined to do so. He expects that Bounderby will reward him by promoting him to Tom's position at the bank. Gradgrind tries to bargain with him but to no avail; Bitzer succeeds in turning Gradgrind's philosophy of hard practicality against him. But Sleary arranges for Tom to be rescued on the way back to Coketown. Sleary's aggressive dog prevents Bitzer from giving chase. Tom is duly sent to America.
	The novel ends with a glimpse of what happens to the major characters in the future. Mrs. Sparsit, having been sent away by Bounderby, lives in cramped quarters with her unpleasant relative, Lady Scadgers. Bounderby dies five years later, of a fit. His will is the subject of endless disputes. Gradgrind tries to live by the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity, but he is scorned by his former political associates. Rachel continues to take pity on Stephen's drunken widow. Tom is lonely in America, and comes back to England, but dies before he can be reconciled with Louisa. Sissy marries and has children. Louisa tries to encourage in others the ""imaginative graces and delights"" that enrich life. She sees this as her duty.
	Analysis
	There are no happy endings in this bleak novel. There is some justice, but there is also some tragic injustice. Those who get their just desserts include Bounderby, whose fabrications are publicly exposed, and Tom, who pays a high price for his misspent life. Gradgrind fares little better. His ""hard facts"" philosophy turns round and bites him in the form of Bitzer, who continues to show that he has learned his lessons well. The repentant Gradgrind is a broken man. Louisa is left to make the best of things and to try to live by the values that are inherent in her but which were crushed by her upbringing and her marriage. The main injustice in the novel is of course the persecution and tragic death of Stephen Blackpool, which is hardly lightened by the sentimental way Dickens describes it. In short, these last chapters show the consequences for everyone when life is lived according to narrow principles, using only the intellect at the expense of the heart.

550,Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"In 399 B.C., Athens sought someone to blame for its humiliating defeat in the Peloponnesian War with Sparta and its allies. This scapegoat, through default more than anything, became Socrates, the legendary Athenian philosopher. Since Socrates often questioned the intentions of Athens' politicians, he was blamed for attempting to ruin Athens through slander of its leaders and religious tradition.
	Socrates defends his actions in The Apology, and defends his decision to carry out his conviction in Crito. When the court suggests to Socrates that he will be acquitted if he agrees to stop practicing philosophy, he responds by saying, ""Athenians, I hold you in the highest regard and love; but I will obey God rather than you: and as long as I have breath and strength I will not cease from philosophy, and from exhorting you, and declaring the truth to every one of you whom I meet.Either acquit me, or do not acquit me, but be sure that I shall not alter my way of life; no, not if I have to die for it many times.""
	Crito takes place later, after Socrates is condemned to death and sitting in jail. At this time, Socrates has many followers who hope he will agree to escape. When Crito, a friend of the philosopher, comes to advocate this position, Socrates logically refutes his argument.",Crito
551,NovelGuide: Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Crito enters the cell, depressed himself at the prospect of Socrates' unjust death. Socrates asserts that a man of his age is lucky to have lived so long, and that his mandated death has not cut short his life. Next, Crito grudgingly tells Socrates that the ship from Delos is approaching, marking the end of an annual Athenian celebration that prohibits political executions for the several weeks of its duration.
	Socrates seems resigned to his fated death, but Crito attempts to persuade him to allow his friends to help him escape prison and flee Athens. If this doesn't happen, Crito says, others will criticize Socrates' disciples for not rescuing their leader from this unfair sentence. Yet Socrates asserts that following popular opinion instead of the gods' will is not right. Soon Crito becomes more desperate, hoping to encourage Socrates with his elaborate and carefully designed plan for escape. He further suggests to Socrates that unless he agrees to escape, he will be letting his sons, who still need to be properly educated by their father, down.
	Socrates responds by inviting Crito into a classic Socratic dialogue, in which Socrates asks a series of questions in efforts to eventually prove Crito's logic faulty. He begins by convincing Crito that the advice of one ""expert"" individual, namely God, should be heeded much more than the advice of countless ignorant people, namely Athens' as a whole. In this way, he proves to Crito that popular opinion is irrelevant.
	Next, Socrates makes the point that it is always better to do right than wrong, no matter what the circumstances. It then follows that although the jurors who condemned Socrates have wronged him, it would still be wrong to violate the laws by escaping. Socrates continues by stating that he doesn't believe in doing wrong to others as a means of retaliation. Crito, helpless in Socrates' logic, quickly agrees with all of this.
",Crito
552,NovelGuide: Crito: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"In this part of the dialogue, Socrates gets to the core of his argument. He asserts that when he agreed to citizenship, he agreed to an unofficial contract with the city of Athens. Socrates says that Athens has married his parents, raised him, and educated him and his children. In return, Socrates has agreed to abide by the city's laws and constitution. In this way, Socrates believes that if he were to escape death, as Crito recommends, he would be breaking the sacred covenant he holds with Athens. The philosopher believes that since he was unable to persuade the jurors in his trial, he now must accept their sentence. Violence, he says, will undermine the very laws that gave him life.
	Speaking in the voice of the law, Socrates supports his premise, saying, ""And we maintain that anyone who disobeys is guilty of doing wrong on three separate counts: first because we are his parent. And secondly because we are his guardians, and thirdly because, after promising obedience, he is neither obeying us nor persuading us to change our decision if we are at fault in any way.""
	Socrates asserts, ""integrity, institutions and laws, are the most precious possessions of mankind."" His last point concerns the jury's decision to condemn him. Socrates believes that though his fellow citizens, the jurors, came to the wrong decision in his trial, it is not his place to avenge their flawed logic. Though people make mistakes, Socrates thinks, the system works. In this way, Socrates dies as a martyr, not for himself, but for his city and its system of justice.

578,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"Plato begins The Republic by addressing the major theme of his entire work: should man be just or unjust? To discuss this issue, Plato (in the character of Socrates) uses a variety of surrounding characters to give their opinions. Yet he proves each of them wrong in turn. Later, he decides that an answer to the above question can be better found if he first defines the word justice.
	The opening scene begins in the home of Cephalus, where his son, Polemarchus, lives as well. Socrates, together with some of his friends, Glaucon and Adeimantus, enter into a conversation regarding aging. Cephalus tells Socrates that he enjoys his old age, citing his devotion to moderation and proper conduct. Soon the topic of justice flows from this conversation. This inspires Polemarchus and Thrasymachus to consider the nature of justice with Socrates. When Socrates criticizes Polemarchus' idea that man should spite his enemies, Thrasymuchus asserts that those with power have a monopoly over justice- they determine it as they see fit, despite the protests of the powerless. It's the duty of the poor, Thrasymuchas says, to rise up and take what they can from the rich. Yet Socrates attacks this viewpoint as well, saying that the poor should accept the true justice of the government, which is created to aid the governed. He goes on to say that justice is a kind of virtue, or excellence, which yields happiness. When all people accept justice, he maintains, all people can live happily in a cohesive community. Yet Socrates still seems to be seeking a better grasp of this notion of justice himself. Obviously this subject will be revisited throughout The Republic.
	Soon Glaucon presents his views to Socrates, asserting that man should pretend to be just but live unjustly in actuality. This way, he says, man can look virtuous before others without undergoing the toil of living a virtuous life. Socrates seems intrigued by this idea, and decides to use a model polis, or city, to better examine these notions of justice. This city has people who are divides into two classes: those who lead and those who serve. Here, Plato initiates his idea of philosopher kings-- the method in which a perfect city will be organized. The leaders of the city must be of a special breed, having incredible insight that protects the lower classes. They must not look out for their own interests, but live frugally, only considering the interests of the people. Limiting the freedom (or animal instincts) of the populace is crucial to instilling proper virtues. Also, the common laborers must be left in the dark on many issues, because any allusions to unjust living might inspire the people to also be unjust. Plato even says that the guardians can lie to the people if necessary. All forms of information, including literature and music, must be strictly regulated. Even a person's professional training must be carefully monitored by the state. In other words, the government forces its people to be virtuous. Free will is left out of the equation.
	Most importantly, the guardians must emulate the gods, since their special knowledge is divinely inspired. Here, Plato's suggestion seems startling similar to the Hebrew concept of monotheistic law, in which earthly kings maintain God's justice. This notion foreshadows Plato's idea of the Forms, which is discussed later in The Republic.
	Soon, Plato divides the class of rulers (or guardians) further. He asserts that the most senior philosophers should be the head guardians, while the others serve as assistants to these men. The guardians should live in a commune, where individual possessions are restricted. Plato believes that too much wealth will inspire greed and selfishness in the guardians, rendering them unable to rule objectively. Only a rigorous, state-run education system can wean off these animalistic qualities of the rulers, and help them make just laws- laws which mean to enhance the common good. True justice, Plato finally determines, is a result of each member of society doing the work prescribed for his social class. The work should not be done to grow rich, since riches corrupt men, leading them to greedy lives. Plato believes that a moderate amount of money will best suit the people to lives of virtue and justice.
",The Republic
579,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Next, Socrates considers justice on the individual level. Just as the model city is divided into classes, so is the human soul. One part of the soul is ruled by reason, another is ruled by spirit, and a third is ruled by appetite. The reason is derived from the wisdom of the wise elders, or philosopher-kings of the city. The other parts come from more base human instincts. Plato believes in moderation: each part should do its work, but not interfere with the other parts. This is of course parallel to the polis caste system, where class members are not suppose to intrude on the jobs of their superiors.
	Soon, Socrates decides to elaborate on his city of perfection. He continues his description of the communal life by saying that marital monogamy is prohibited. Plato believes that everybody belongs to everybody else. Here, we seem to be reading Huxley's Brave New World.
	To continue this strain, Socrates says that children will be taken by the government at a very early age, and the inferior babies will be left to die while the superior ones will be raised and educated by the government. In promoting this idea of ""one big family,"" Plato intends to break down barriers of class and race, so that the pursuit of virtue can be foremost on everyone's mind. Yet the most important reason for his ""social tampering"" is to ensure the genetic superiority of the ruling class.
	Also, Socrates expounds on his beliefs about war. He strongly discourages war between Greeks (i.e. Sparta vs. Athens) because he believes Greeks have a common identity and natural superiority as a single people. He also encourages the youth of the city to watch the battles to gain experience for future conflicts.
	Soon, Plato expounds on the ruling class. Here, he gets into his ideal of philosopher kings. As alluded to before, Plato asserts that only a philosopher can possess true knowledge, based on the insight of the Forms- unchanging, divine laws that exist in another, imperceptible reality. The true philosopher loves the Forms and finds his deepest satisfaction in discovering and administering them. Here, as stated earlier, Plato touches on the Hebrew idea of monotheistic law. Yet the Hebrews would certainly not accept Plato's Brave New World-ish Utopia.
	Next, Plato defends his philosopher-king idea. He does this by using the metaphor of a sea-faring vessel in which no leadership exists. While many good navigators exist, they are unable to steer the ship because other, more power-hungry individuals, assume control, despite their ignorance. Here, the philosophers are the skilled navigators who never get an opportunity to lead, due to their distaste for politics. This, of course, is how Plato sees the city of Athens at this time.
",The Republic
580,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"In this section of The Republic, Plato begins his description of metaphysical good. Only the Forms, which possess true knowledge, identify this good. Therefore only philosophers (who understand the Forms) can know it. The rest of the population simply holds onto opinions-- imaginative ideas founded in often faulty observation. Soon, Plato illustrates these ideas with the metaphor of the cave. Briefly, this metaphor takes place in a dark cave where everyone is forced to look at one wall. This wall possesses shadows created by puppets in front of the sun, which is the backdrop to the scene and illuminates everyone in its grasp. The sun helps those who feel it to remember the knowledge they have forgotten. The philosopher is the person who escapes the cave and learns to see objects, not as shadows, but as they really are. Thus these gifted philosophers understand true goodness through education and knowledge of the Forms. In this way, Plato answers the ridicule many philosophers receive for seeming disconnected from reality. Indeed they are disconnected from the reality of the shadows- they know a deeper reality-that of the sun.
	Next, Plato details his ideas about the varieties of government, and what causes them to change forms. He says that oligarchy becomes democracy when the upper class becomes motivated by money instead of virtue. Then, the lower class becomes poverty-stricken, causing them to rebel. Plato continues, ""And when the poor win, the result is a democracy."" Since a democracy is little more than anarchy, where man's evil appetites reign supreme over his virtue, the cornerstone of a just society collapses. Soon a strong leader emerges from this chaos, and a dictatorship begins.
	Toward the end of The Republic, Plato addresses the immortality of the human soul. It is this eternal life that makes it possible for humans to learn, since learning is nothing more than remembering knowledge from previous lives. He reasons (through creative rationale) that the soul can never die since it is not inherently evil in itself. He continues by giving a quite long-winded description of a purgatory-type system where the soul is forced to live for one millennium before being reincarnated into another body. Obviously this theory of immortality is quite different from the Hebrew or Christian concept.
",The Republic
581,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"
	A short prologue begins the story. In it the narrator states that the story of the pearl has been worn to its essence by many retellings in the town from which it originated. As such, things in the story will be black and white, more purely evil and good than as in life. The narrator speculates that if the story is a parable then perhaps the reader will find some lesson for his or her own life.
	The novel opens just before dawn in the coastal village of La Paz on the Gulf of Mexico. Kino awakens just as the morning light is coming into the sky. The roosters, pigs and wild birds are already awake in the yard outside Kino's thatch hut. The first thing Kino sees upon opening his eyes is the light outlining the door to his hut and then he sees the hanging box where his infant son, Coyotito, sleeps. Next he looks at his wife Juana beside him on the mat. Her eyes, as they always are when Kino awakes, are already open. Most of her head is covered in a blue shawl that she uses to ward off the chill of night. She is looking at him.
	Kino hears the music of the waves upon the shore. We learn that in the past everything Kino's people did or saw became a song but that time has long since passed and no new songs have been created. Kino, however, has his personal song that is ""clear and soft"" that, if he chose to give it a name, would be called ""The Song of the Family.""
	Juana rises and, after checking to see that Coyotito is well, fans an ember from the firepit into the morning cooking fire. Kino, meanwhile, puts on his sandals and steps outside the hut to watch the dawn. A goat approaches him and a moth flies into the light of the fire. Kino now hears the song of the family coming from the stone where Juana is grinding the corn for the morning meal. The dawn comes suddenly while Kino watches ""with the detachment of God"" a group of ants in the sand. When a thin timid dog approaches Kino offers it a kind word and the dog rests contentedly near him.
	The narrator interjects that though this morning is like any other, it is perfect in its way. From the hut Kino can hear the sound of Juana singing an ancient song that forms part of the song of the family. Though the melody consists of only three notes the song is part of Kino's life and for him evokes feelings of safety and warmth. From other brush houses Kino hears other families rising with their own songs.
	Kino is young with black hair, brown skin and a thin mustache and warm but fierce eyes. Before he steps inside Kino see two inept roosters preparing for a fight in the yard and a covey of wild doves flying inland to the hills. Inside Juana has finished preparing the corn cakes and is braiding her hair. Kino eats hot corn cakes and drinks some pulque that, except for rare occasions, has always been his morning meal. Kino's sigh of satisfaction after he has eaten is all the conversation necessary for Juana and Kino to begin their day.
	The rising sun streams through the crack in the brush house and Kino and Juana's attention is suddenly drawn to a deadly scorpion descending one of the ropes supporting Coyotito's hanging box. The scorpion brings to Kino's mind the song of evil, brought by any enemy of the family, and as the scorpion draws closer to the happily gurgling infant Juana begins to recite both pagan and Christian prayers of protection. Kino slowly approaches the deadly creature but Coyotito's laughter causes the rope to shake and the scorpion falls onto the boys' shoulder. The scorpion stings Coyotito before Kino can pull it away and stamp it to death on the earth floor.
	Juana pulls the baby from the crib and immediately begins to suck the poison from the wound. The neighbors, including Kino's older brother Juan Thom�s and his wife Apolonia, come rushing at the sound of the screaming child. Everyone knows that though Juana has done her best to remove the poison there is a good chance the baby will die if enough of the venom remains. After the sickness begins the baby will suffer terribly until he dies. Juana demands that Kino bring the doctor to treat Coyotito.
	Everyone gathered at Kino's hut knows that it would be very surprising if the doctor came since he never came to the poor indian's huts. After Kino tells his wife that the doctor will not come, she responds that they must go to him. With his son's life at stake Kino agrees. Everyone follows Kino and Juana to the doctor's house. They take the path to where the stone portion of the city begins, where the walled houses hold cool inner gardens with caged birds and splashing fountains. As they proceed to the doctor's home, new people join the procession including four beggars normally posted outside the church who know everything that happens in the town. The beggars know that the doctor, who thinks of the indians as animals, will not deign to treat Kino's son.
	At the gate to the doctor's house Kino hesitates when he considers that the doctor is the descendent a people that for four hundred years had subjugated his own. Kino feels weak, afraid and angry. Kino hears the music of the enemy in his ears. Even though the rage and terror grow within him, Kino thinks to remove his hat before lifting the iron knocker on the gate. The servant who comes to the door is an indian of Kino's own race and Kino says in their common language that his child is sick and needs a healer. The servant, refusing to use the indian language, tells Kino that he will inform the doctor of the reason for their visit and then he shuts the gate.
	The doctor is languishing in his sumptuous bedchamber, drinking chocolate and, as he often does, thinking of the time that he spent in Paris as a young man when he could afford a mistress and still have the small luxuries of life. Dressed in a silk robe, the doctor drinks from a cup of china that is so small that he must use only the tip of his thumb and forefinger to lift it. He is fat and his voice has become hoarse. On the walls are various religious pictures including one in the same style depicting his deceased wife. When the servant informs the doctor of Kino's request, the doctor contemptuously asks if the indians have any money to pay for his services. The servant returns to Kino who produces several small, misshapen pearls of little value. After a time the servant returns the pearls to Kino and makes the excuse that the doctor has gone out to treat a serious case.
	The group waiting with Kino quickly dissolves because they do not want to witness his shame. Kino stands at the doctor's shut gate in silence for a time and then, after replacing his hat on his head, suddenly strikes the iron gate with his fist which causes his knuckles to begin bleeding.
	Analysis
	The novel is set in the town of La Paz, which Steinbeck visited in the course of a biological expedition with his scientist friend Ed Ricketts. The oyster beds of La Paz produced many of the pearls that had fueled the Spanish conquest of the region during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. While in La Paz, Steinbeck heard the story of a young indian who found a valuable pearl and hid it under a rock. After he was nearly killed by robbers the young indian threw the pearl back into the sea. Inspired by the tale, Steinbeck wrote his own version of the story which was initially published in Woman's Home Companion (December, 1945) as ""The Pearl of The World"". The story was first published as a book in 1947 to coincide with the release of the movie version.
	The first chapter begins with a series of descriptions -- Kino and Juana awaking, the simple but comforting disposition of their brush house, and the activities of the various animals Kino observes outside his hut. We learn that Kino is sensitive to the small details of his world and that these things all form a part of the security and comfort embodied in Kino's song of the family. When the narrator observes that ""it was a morning like other morning and yet perfect among mornings"" we can infer that Kino's life is being presented in the manner of a parable in which people and events are portrayed as sharply delineated between good and evil so that the reader can draw the narrator's intended lesson.
	The scorpion evokes the song of evil, which Kino hears whenever an enemy of the family threatens. The episode with the scorpion makes that morning different from those that preceded it and precipitates the need for a visit to the doctor's house. This in turn leads to a sharp and painful reminder to Kino that his race has always been kept poor and ignorant and that without money his son will never rise above that condition.
	Through the episode with the doctor we learn of the social stratification in the town. The prosperous descendents of the Spanish conquerors, like the doctor, still maintain the master/slave relationship with the natives whom they suppress with ignorance and poverty. Those natives who try to step outside the traditional relations are censured and, in Kino's case, publicly humiliated. Kino's futile striking of the doctor's iron gate with his fist belies his suppressed rage and bitterness.
",The Pearl
582,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"

	The second chapter begins with a description of the town's broad estuary. Steinbeck characteristically begins with the larger panorama of the lay of the land and then moves into progressively smaller details in the landscape. On the beach are the villager's canoes -- seaworthy boats that are passed down from father to son and are protected against the elements by a shell plaster made from a secret recipe known only to the fishing people. Also on the beach are dogs and pigs that search for dead fish and birds to eat. The estuary is home to numerous sea flora and fauna such as fiddler crabs, eel grass and the poisonous spotted botete fish. Due to the effects of the sun and sea mist a hazy blanket of moisture often hangs over the coast and causes mirages to appear. As a result the villagers have learned to trust their instincts more than their eyes.
	Kino and Juana with Coyotito come to the beach to put out to sea in Kino's canoe. The canoe has been handed down from Kino's grandfather and father and is his only valuable possession; moreover, without the canoe Kino and his family would be unable to fish and hunt pearls and they would starve. Kino places his diving rock and ropes in the canoe.
	Juana puts a seaweed poultice on Coyotito's arm. The narrator observes that the poultice will do more for the baby's wound than anything the doctor could do but that, in her ignorance, Juana prays that Kino might find a pearl of sufficient value to pay the doctor. Kino and Juana get in the canoe and together they paddle out to the oyster bed. The narrator states that this oyster bed has been well worked since the days when it made the King of Spain a great power. A pearl forms in an oyster when a grain of sand irritates the oyster's flesh until the oyster forms a protective shell around the irritation. The resulting pearl is thus an accident and finding one is a matter of luck.
	Using his diving stone, Kino sinks to the seafloor and carefully begins placing oysters in his basket. The Song of the Sea is in Kino's ears and interwoven with it is the Song of the Pearl That Might Be. Because of Coyotito's illness the Song of the Pearl is louder that day than on other days. Kino is young and strong and can hold is breath for more than two minutes at a time. Just before Kino reaches the point where he must return to the surface for air, however, he sees a large oyster with a reflective flash inside. Hopeful, Kino grabs the oyster and returns to the canoe. Not wanting to press their luck, Juana and Kino ignore the large oyster for a moment but Kino soon opens it with his knife and they discover a large, perfect pearl. The narrator describes it as ""the greatest pearl in the world.""
	Holding the pearl in his damaged hand, Kino begins to imagine the possibilities that have suddenly opened up to him through the wealth the pearl will bring his family. Juana calls Kino's attention to Coyotito's shoulder where the swelling has subsided and Kino's joy at his good fortune overflows in a loud cry of happiness that all the other oyster divers out on the water can hear.
	Analysis
	Steinbeck begins this chapter by first describing the larger panorama of the surrounding terrain before moving onto descriptions of progressively smaller details in the landscape. In this manner the fisherpeople are linked to the larger natural world of the estuary, which encompasses not only the lush sea life, but also the villager's canoes on the beach and the curtain of Gulf moisture that pervades the town.
	The narrator's interjections throughout this chapter are important for through them we learn details that are hidden from the characters but which affect our reading of them. For instance, the reader knows that the seaweed poultice will do more to treat Coyotito's wound than anything the doctor could have provided will. Juana, who does not know this, continues to pray for money to pay the doctor. The narrator also informs the reader that the pearl that Kino holds is ""the pearl of the world."" Because Kino does not know this he will never know what constitutes its fair market value.
	This chapter also serves to broaden the reader's understanding of Juana's role in the family. We learn, for instance, that she is an active and necessary partner in the process of gathering pearls. Thus, not only does she sustain the family by caring for Coyotito and preparing their meals but she also helps row the canoe to the oyster beds. Her relationship with Kino has a strong element of pragmatism made necessary by their poverty and the physical difficulties inherent to their daily work. This is why the narrator observes of Kino's canoe that ""it was at one property and source of food, for a man with a boat can guarantee a woman that she will eat something.""
	The narrator's description of pearls as the accidental byproducts of the irritation caused by a grain of sand in an oyster muscle, serves to establish the cause for their rarity and thus their value. It also serves to establish the degree of luck it takes to find one, much less a truly valuable one. The Song of the Pearl that Might Be consists of Kino's dreams, anxieties and prayers - all of which play a part in his submarine search. The narrator suggests that because of Coyotito's wound the need for a valuable pearl is even greater for Kino on that day than on others and the song is more audible in Kino's ears as a result. In this way the narrator connects the scorpion's sting to Kino's discovery of the pearl.
	The moment Kino sees the pearl he is changed by the possibilities it holds for his family. Just like the pearl was a kind of seed embedded in the oyster, so now are Kino's dreams of a new life embedded in his psyche because of the pearl.
",The Pearl
583,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"

	As is the nature of small towns the news of Kino's discovery spreads quickly so that by the time Kino and Juana reach shore everyone has heard about the pearl. In town, the Priest hears the news and tries to remember if he married Kino and Juana in the church. The doctor hears of the pearl while sitting with a wealthy patient and claims that he is treating Kino's son for a scorpion bite. The beggars hear of the pearl and look forward to alms from Kino. The pearl buyers, all of whom work for the same man, know that Kino will bring the pearl to one of them and though they will only make their normal salary on the transaction each dreams of taking their boss' place. Indeed, the whole town comes to transfer their dreams and desires onto to Kino's pearl and to think of it as potentially their own with only Kino standing in the way. The narrator says that the news of the pearl ""stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town"" and that the ""poison sacs of the town began to manufacture venom, and the town swelled with the pressure of it.""
	Kino and Juana, meanwhile, are ignorant of the town's malignant desires. When the indians of the village come to see the pearl and admire its perfection Juan Tomas asks Kino what he will do when now that he is a rich man. Kino, looking into the pearl, replies that he and Juana will be married in the church, they will wear fine clothes and he will own a rifle. After Kino announces that he will have his own rifle, otherwise an impossible luxury for any indian of the village, he begins to dream of even greater things and realizes that his ultimate dream is that Coyotito go to school so that his son may learn to read and write and free his people from the cycle of poverty and exploitation in which they have been trapped for generations.
	It is a noteworthy occasion and the villagers who are watching understand that whether Kino succeeds or fails to obtain riches and good fortune they will always remember the day that he found the pearl. Juana begins to make the fire for the family's evening meal but before the visitors leave their hut the Priest enters accompanied by the song of evil. The Priest has always treated the indians like children and Kino is suspicious of his motives when the Priest tries to gain Kino's favor by telling him that Kino is named after a great father of the Church. The Priest asks to see the pearl and, awed by its beauty, he asks that Kino and Juana remember to give thanks to God. Juana proudly tells the Priest that she and Kino will be married in the Church and the Priest blesses them before leaving.
	While Juana prepares the beans for their evening meal, Kino steps outside the hut but he is immediately overcome by feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. He grasps the pearl tightly in his hand. He hears the song of the family coming from the kitchen but mixed with the song is the knowledge that since he has made a plan to send Coyotito to school he will have to struggle to make that plan reach fruition. At this point, the doctor arrives and pretends that he had always intended to treat the baby. Suspicious of the doctor's motives, Kino explains that Coyotito is feeling better but the doctor insists that the poison could return in the night and that only he, the doctor, can prevent the young one's death. Juana believes the doctor and Kino, crushed by his own ignorance, reluctantly lets the doctor treat Coyotito with a pill of white powder that Kino suspects is simply more poison. Before leaving, the doctor warns Kino that the poison from the scorpion will return within the hour.
	The doctor returns to his comfortable home where he nibbles at dinner and waits for an hour to pass. Kino folds the pearl into a rag and buries it in the corner of the hut. In the estuary a school of big fish feed on small fish and the noise of the battle carries to the village. After Kino has eaten his beans Juana calls him over to look at Coyotito who is now very sick. The doctor returns and many of the village people crowd into the hut to see him do battle with the scorpion's poison. The doctor gives Coyotito some diluted ammonia solution and the baby's stomach spasms relent. Juana is thankful but Kino remains suspicious. The doctor, pretending not to know of Kino's pearl, asks how he will pay for Coyotito's treatment and after the villagers tell the doctor of the pearl the doctor offers to keep it in his safe. The doctor watches Kino's eyes which betray the pearl's hiding place when Kino refuses the doctors offer and claims that the pearl is secure. Kino tells the doctor he will pay him after he has sold the pearl in the morning. The doctor leaves.
	Kino is restless and Juana watches him dig up the pearl and rebury it under his sleeping mat. Juana asks Kino whom he fears and Kino answers that he fears everyone. Kino, Juana and Coyotito lay down together to sleep and Kino dreams of his son in school but the dream turns to a nightmare and Kino awakes to the sound of someone digging inside the house. Kino lunges at the intruder with his knife but he is struck in the head and the intruder gets away. Juana cleans Kino's bleeding wound and sensing the hatred growing in her husband she insists that the pearl is evil and should be destroyed before it destroys the family. But Kino insists that after they sell the pearl everything will be better. It is near dawn and Kino removes the pearl from its hiding place. The contentment it brings Kino spreads to Juana and they are both happy and hopeful as the sun rises.
	Analysis
	Now that Kino has brought the pearl to shore and claimed it his own the close ties that once made the small town safe and familiar to him now work to turn the people's greed against Kino. This is illustrated when he steps out into the evening and is filled with a sense of foreboding on the same spot that had that very morning filled him with contentment. He does not know specifically who his enemies are but, as he tells Juana, he fears everyone. This is a new feeling for Kino and is indicative of the manner in which the pearl brings not only the possibility of wealth but uncertainty and danger as well. The danger brought by the scorpion has been transferred to the people of the town and Steinbeck's direct comparison between the two furthers the sharp divisions between good and evil that marks the story as a parable.
	The pearl causes Kino to dream of things, like the rifle or an education, that were outside his previous station. As a result, the dreams have brought danger into his life and begun change him. After Kino finishes listing the things he will do with the wealth derived from the pearl the narrator remarks that Kino ""had never said so many words together in his life."" Juana senses the change in her husband after the attack and though she can see the potential for evil in the pearl she too is beguiled by the previously unattainable luxuries, like medical care for her son, made possible by the pearl. Juana also betrays her own dreams and biases when she proudly tells the priest that she and Kino will be married in the church. Furthermore, because she was unable to trust in the healing power of the seaweed poultice she and Kino have been duped by the doctor and become indebted to him.
	The doctor is revealed by his actions to be not only arrogant but duplicitous. The implication for the reader is that he is the force behind the night intruder. At the end of the chapter both Juana and Kino hope to exchange the pearl, which removed from nature has become an object of the town's greed and thus dangerous to them, for wealth that they believe will transform their family for the better
",The Pearl
584,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"

	It is early in the morning and the whole town of La Paz knows that this is the day that Kino will sell his pearl. The pearl buyers wait anxiously in their stalls to offer the lowest price possible for Kino's pearl. The narrator makes the point that this doesn't make them evil, it only makes them good pearl buyers because every man should strive to be his best their low bidding is a natural result of their station. The moisture in the air is especially thick and creates the mirage of a large mountain to the north of the city. The pearl divers stay on shore to witness the sale of Kino's pearl. Kino's neighbors discuss what they would do with the money and they hope that the pearl will not destroy Kino and his family by making them greedy. Because it is a special morning, Juana, Coyotito and Kino dress in their best clothes, which are simple and ragged but clean. Kino puts on his straw hat and checks to make sure it rides properly on his head - too far back or on the side would be indicative of a young, rash man and directly atop his head would be too much like an old man. Kino's hat rides slightly forward to indicate aggressiveness and certainty of purpose.
	Many people follow the family as they walk into town but only Juan Thomes walks beside Kino. The two men agree that Kino must be careful not to be cheated but since neither knows what is paid for the pearls outside La Paz they are unsure how to value the pearl. Juan Thomes tells of a time before Kino was born when the elders of the village decided to hire an agent to take their pearls directly to the capital but after two men disappeared en route they gave up on the attempt and returned to the old way of going through the pearl buyers. Kino notes that as a result, the priest at that time and to the current day annually preached a sermon warning that each man should know his station in life and not try to better himself. The sun is intense and the brother's squint their eyes at the glare. The narrator notes that squinting is the only form of defense the poor indians have ever had against the descendents of the conquerors. As the procession makes it way through town many people come out of their homes to watch it pass.
	In his office, a stout slow pearl buyer hopes that Kino will come to him. Like all the other buyers he has a black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him. While he waits and hopes, the pearl buyer practices sleight of hand with a coin in his right hand below the desk. Kino enters this man's office and receives a kind greeting. The buyer continues to practice with his coin out of sight. Playing for dramatic effect, Kino slowly brings out his deerskin pouch and rolls the great pearl onto the buyer's tray. The buyer's face betrays no reaction but under the desk his fingers stumble with the coin and it drops into his lap. All the spectators hold their breath waiting to hear the buyer's offer. The dealer declares that the pearl is a monstrosity and of little value except as an oddity. The buyer denies Kino's insistence that it is a very valuable pearl and offers him only a thousand pesos. Kino accuses the buyer of trying to cheat him. The buyer assures Kino that the pearl is not valuable and to prove his claim he has a boy bring three other buyers to the office. Because they all work for the same man, these buyers know how much has been offered and none of them make a higher bid. Kino angrily insists he has been cheated and suggests that he will take the pearl to capital himself. The buyers realize too late that they have underbid by too great a sum and the man ups his offer to 1,500 pesos before Kino angrily storms out of his office.
	Later that evening, the villagers discuss the event. Some believe the buyer and think Kino a fool not to have taken the generous offer of 1,500 pesos, others think that the buyers will never do business with Kino again and that he has destroyed himself in his brashness. Still others believe that Kino is courageous and silently hope for the best. Kino reburies the pearl and decides that though he is afraid of leaving the village he will do it and attempt to sell the pearl in the capital. Juan Thomes comes to visit and expresses his fears for Kino and observes that he has defied the village's way of life. Kino retorts that he must try to better himself and Juan Thomes gives his blessing.
	Much later in the evening Kino is sitting despondently in the hut listening to the night noises and he senses evil things lurking outside. He steps outside with his knife in hand and is immediately attacked. Juana rushes to his aid, armed with a stone, but the assailants have retreated into the shadows and Kino is lying hurt with a bloody scalp and a long, deep cut from his ear to his chin. After Juana has cleaned Kino's wounds she again beseeches him to destroy the pearl and declares it a thing of evil that will destroy them if they keep it. Kino insists that he will overcome the evil and they shall not be cheated of their good fortune. He insists that she believe him because he is a man. Juana asserts that she is afraid because a man can be killed but Kino pays her no heed. Kino asks if she is afraid to go with him, over the sea and mountains to the capital and she answers that she will go. They lie down to sleep.
	Analysis
	During the course of this chapter Kino and Juana realize the true strength of the forces arrayed against them. Though many people accompany them to the pearl buyer's office, it is more out of curiosity than for support. This is proven later when many of the villagers believe Kino has been foolish not to accept the offer of 1,500 pesos. Since none of the buyers will make what Kino feels to be a fair offer on the large pearl, Kino realizes that he will have to take the pearl to the city himself and that he will not be able to capitalize on his good luck as easily as he hoped. Furthermore, as the story Juan Thomes tells illustrates, he will now be defying the set way of doing things and may suffer as a consequence.
	The pearl buyer's habit of practicing ledgermain with a coin is an effective literary device that illustrates his skill in bargaining without recourse to outright narrative exposition. The moment when he drops the coin upon seeing the pearl indicates to the reader that he recognizes the pearl's true value. Furthermore, the fact that his face does not betray this knowledge further illustrates to the reader the pearl buyer's skill as a broker.
	After the second, more deadly attack upon Kino, Juana is convinced that the pearl will bring them nothing but destruction but Kino asserts his status as a man and insists that he can turn the pearl to fortune. That Juana agrees to accompany him to the capital illustrates her continued faith in him as well as her sense of place in the family. She has a voice but must acquiesce to her husband's decisions. Her decision to accompany him reveals that she is still most comfortable in her traditional role even though her husband is seeking to change his own role in the community.

	Kino awakens late in the night and watches Juana go the pearl's hiding place after which she slips quietly out the door. Full of anger, Kino follows her to the shore where he stops her just as she is about to throw the pearl into the sea. Kino strikes Juana brutally in the face and then kicks her in the side after she has fallen to the ground. Throughout this ordeal Juana makes no attempt to resist. Kino takes the pearl and leaves Juana lying in the surf. On his way back to the hut, however, several assailants assault Kino. Though he pierces one of his attackers with his knife the others strike him to the ground and search Kino's pockets. Meanwhile Juana washes her bruised face in the ocean. She holds no grudge against Kino because she believes men to be half-insane and half gods and she believes she could not live without one. She accepts these differences between the sexes as the way of the world. On her way home Juana finds the pearl behind a stone where Kino dropped it during the assault and then she sees Kino and another man with a fatal gash in his throat lying on the beach. Juana realizes in an instant that their old life is irrevocably gone and that they must flee or be destroyed. While she drags the dead man into the bushes Kino comes back to consciousness and begins mourning for the loss of his pearl. Juana explains quickly that she has the pearl and that because Kino has killed a man they must leave immediately. Kino agrees that they would not receive fair treatment if the case was presented in town and they decide to flee together. Juana goes to gather Coyotito and all their available food from the hut while Kino goes to get his canoe ready for the journey.
	Kino discovers that someone has knocked a hole in the bottom of his canoe - an unthinkable crime in the village. Numbed by the loss of his canoe Kino walks toward his hut but before he reaches it he sees flames leaping into the predawn sky. He encounters Juana holding Coyotito. Juana explains that she returned to the hut to find that it had been ransacked and then, as she searched the wreckage, someone had set fire to it from the outside. Kino, Juana and Coyotito slip into Juan Thomes' house before anyone sees them. Apolonia returns distraught from watching Kino's hut burn and is surprised to find them alive and in her hut. At Kino's command, however, she fetches Juan Thomes who, after hearing that Kino has killed a man, agrees to hide his brother until nightfall. Kino, Juana and Coyotito spend the day hiding in Juan Thomes' hut while Juan Thomes spreads various theories among the villagers as to where Kino might have disappeared. A fierce storm lashes the water throughout the course of the day and none of the pearl divers take their boats to sea. Under various pretences, Juan Thomes borrows food and tools, including a long knife, from his neighbors and gives them to Kino. Kino tells his brother that he and his family will go overland to the north where they believe there are cities where they can sell the pearl. Before Kino leaves he tells his brother that he cannot give up the pearl because it has become part of his soul.
	Analysis
	This chapter chronicles the further deterioration of Kino's former life as he fights with Juana, suffers the loss of his canoe and home and is again assaulted by an unknown enemy. Thus, the process begun with the discovery of the pearl and Kino's refusals to accept the buyer's offer has now come to bloodshed.
	When Kino kills his assailant the ties to his life as a member of the village are forever sundered. He is now a murderer and, though he killed in self-defense, he knows that the officials in the town will not believe his story.
	Juana's attempt to throw the pearl into the sea demonstrates the depth of her conviction that the pearl, far from a source of wealth and prosperity, is actually a thing of evil. Although she is willing to defy Kino by throwing it into the sea she is equally willing to suffer his blows and accept his will as the head of the family. Significantly, it is Juana who saves the pearl, drags the dead man into the bushes, insists that they leave immediately and retrieves Coyotito from the burning hut all of which make possible the family's continued survival. Kino's attachment to the pearl is revealed in his state of helplessness when he believes it to have been stolen and his confession to his brother that it has become one with his soul.
	Juan Thomes' willingness to shelter Kino and the pearl, even if only for a day indicates that he is Kino's one true friend left in the village. Aside from Juan Thomes, however, there is no reason to believe that anyone in La Paz, whether indian or not, will help Kino in his attempt to create real prosperity for his family. The destruction of Kino's canoe is an event which the narrator qualifies with the observations that ""the killing of a man was not so evil as the killing of a boat"" and that as a result there was ""sorrow in Kino's rage, but this last thing [destruction of the canoe] had tightened him beyond breaking."" The force of these statements leads the reader to understand that because of the destruction of Kino's canoe not only will the family's escape be more difficult but also their old way of life has been violated, never again to be made whole.

586,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 6,"

	In the night Kino and Juana with Coyotito skirt the edge of the town and take the road through the brush country towards Loreto. The night is windy and Kino is thankful because the wind will erase their tracks on the dusty path. The family walks all night and the wind dies down soon after moonrise. Tapping into the ancient ways of his people, Kino is exceptionally ""cautious and wary and dangerous"" like a hunted animal and is careful that they should walk in the wheel ruts so that in the morning the first wagon will erase their prints. At dawn they take shelter off the road behind a clump of trees and Kino uses a branch to wipe away the footprints where they left the road.
	Kino and Juana eat some of Apolonia's corncakes and then Juana falls asleep but Kino stays awake. The air is hot and dry. When Juana awakes at midday she asks him if they will be followed and Kino answers that most likely they will but he doesn't know who attacked him or who will follow. Kino reiterates his desire for a rifle once the pearl is sold. Kino looks deep into the pearl's surface and is shocked by a series of images: the man he has stabbed, Juana crawling painfully through the surf and Coyotito's face flushed with fever. The music of the pearl has become the music of evil. Kino puts the pearl away and eventually falls asleep.
	Juana stays awake and plays with Coyotito after he awakes. Kino begins to thrash in the grip of a nightmare and comes awake fully alert. He creeps to a clump of bushes by the road and sees two trackers on foot and a rifleman on a horse coming down the road. Kino knows that these men are experts and if they find the place he has swept he will have to lunge forward and try to kill the gunman first. After pausing at the spot, however, the trio continues down the road. Kino knows they will return and panic takes hold of him. He suggests to Juana that he should surrender but she reminds him that the trackers will not allow him to live once they have the pearl. Kino decides that the family should flee overland into the stony mountains were it will be more difficult to follow their trail.
	As Kino and Juana frantically make their way across the scorched arid landscape toward the granite mountains Kino hears the song of evil resounding clearly in his head. They pause at the first rise in the land and Juana and Coyotito drink the last of the water. Kino tells his wife to hide and wait for the trackers to pass and he will continue alone. Juana refuses to leave him and Kino takes strength from her resolution. Moving with more purpose now, Kino and his family zigzag toward the mountains in an effort to throw off the trackers. The ground begins to rise steeply and Kino readjusts their course toward a cleft in the mountains that looks like it might contain water. He knows that the trackers may have the same thought but without water his family will not survive so he has no choice. The narrator describes the rivulet of water in the cleft that draws all the animals in the area either to drink or to hunt the game that comes to drink - in this way the rivulet is a giver of both life and death.
	By the time Kino, Juana and Coyotito reach the water the sun has set behind the mountains. There is still enough light, however, for Kino to see that far behind them the trackers have begun to follow the family's path to the cleft. He knows they will arrive before dark. Juana and Coyotito hide in one of the shallow cave-like depressions in the cliff wall and Kino joins them after creating a diversionary path further up the cliff. Juana promises that the baby will not cry because she claims he knows of the danger.
	The trackers and the gunman eventually arrive at the spring and although they see Kino's diversionary trail they decide to settle for the night. Kino can see the tracker's cigarettes glowing in the night. Juana struggles to keep the baby silent. One of the men strikes a match and Kino can see that he is sitting up with the rifle and the other two are asleep. Kino tells Juana that he will sneak up on the man and seize the rifle but he must do so before the moon rises and sheds too much light. Although she initially resists the idea, Juana accepts it once she realizes they will be discovered in the morning.
	Kino removes his white clothes because ""his own brown skin was better protection for him"" and cautiously makes his way to just a few yards from the watchman. The song of the family is in Kino's ears as he slowly edges closer. Just as Kino is about to pounce on the man and seize the gun, the moon rises and fills the area with light. Kino hesitates a moment and in that instant he hears the sound of Coyotito crying from above. The watcher stands up, awakening one of the sleepers and they decide that the sound, which repeats, might be a coyote pup. The rifleman cocks his gun to fire at the sound and Kino jumps, but too late to prevent the man from getting off a shot. Kino stabs the rifleman in the neck and chest, fatally strikes the seated man and shoots the third with the rifle as he tries to flee up the side of the cliff. In the ensuing silence Kino hears Juana's hysterical cries and he knows that his son is dead.
	Late in the afternoon Kino and Juana return to the La Paz carrying the dead Coyotito in a blood soaked bundle. They walk into town side by side, Juana is distant and fatigued, Kino full of danger and fear. The narrator interjects that perhaps because the setting sun cast long shadows this is what ""left the deep impression on those who saw them."" The neighbors stand away as they pass and Juan Tomas raises his hand in greeting but does not speak. Kino now hears the song of the family as a battle cry as they steadily make their way to the seashore where he removes the pearl and sees in its surface an image of his dead son. He first offers the pearl to Juana to throw in the ocean. She shakes her head, indicating that Kino must do it himself. Using all his strength, Kino throws the pearl far into the ocean where it settles to the bottom and is soon covered by the sand raised by a scuttling crab.
	Analysis
	This chapter begins with the details of the family's departure from the town and the subsequent pursuit. The narrator interjects at several points to describe the manner in which Kino has become more like an animal fleeing danger. In some instances, as when he thinks to walk in the wagon ruts, this serves is to his advantage but as in the case where he and the family haphazardly run to the high place ""as nearly all animals do when they are pursued"" his animal instincts override his ability to reason. The narrator's vivid description of the spring to which they flee underscore the fact that Kino and Juana have become only the most recent example of animals driven to its water to either take sustenance or bring death. Once he is cornered Kino resolves to attack the pursuers before they can discover the family and to do this he removes his clothing and completes his transformation. The family has become little more than hunted game sheltering in a makeshift den. Significantly, Coyotito's cries are mistaken for that of a Coyote pup and Juana's primal screams are described as ""the cry of death"".
	Kino's confidence in the pearl begins to waver during the course of the pursuit. Not only does he consider surrendering after he first sees the trackers but he panics and leads the family pell-mell across the plain without regard for the easy trail they are leaving for the trackers. In both instances, Juana reassures him and reaffirms his need for preservation. Most importantly, the visions of prosperity and happiness Kino once saw in the pearl change and become dark and macabre. Finally, after Coyotito's death, Kino understands that the pearl has brought evil to his family and he is able to throw it back into the sea. Significantly he offers Juana, who was first to understand the evil of the pearl, the chance to dispose of it. True to her station, however, Juana remains steadfast as Kino's wife and returns his manhood to him by insisting that he do the deed himself.
	At story's end, his association with the pearl has irrevocably changed Kino. Whereas the song of the family was once filled with comfort and security it now sounds like a call to battle. Kino is at once full of anger for the misery that has been wrought upon his family and full of fear for the future. Of the things Kino wished for from the pearl only the rifle has come to fruition. He returns to the village holding the rifle and Juana returns holding their dead son. The juxtaposition of these images makes clear the price Kino has paid for his daring wish for a rifle.

605,The Jungle: Novel Summary,"

Summary
The Jungle begins with Marija Berczynskas overseeing and organizing a wedding ceremony in the ‘back of the yards’ in Chicago. She is Lithuanian and today her cousin, Ona Lukoszaite, has just married fellow Lithuanian Jurgis Rudkus. Ona is not quite sixteen and the readers are told her new husband is able to carry a two hundred and fifty pound quarter of beef without staggering, but he is as ‘frightened as a hunted animal’ at the wedding celebrations.
	A ‘charming informality’ is one of the characteristics of this celebration, but it is a law (transplanted from Lithuania) that no one leaves hungry. Ona’s stepmother is Aunt Elizabeth, and is referred to as Teta Elzbieta, and she and other women bring masses of food through to the guests.
	There is also music being played and this transforms the place from a saloon ‘to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky’. The violinist is Tamoszius Kuszleika and he later gets engaged to Marija. Ona is spared from crying too much (with happiness) by listening to Marija teach the musicians a song they do not know. She is described as a powerful woman who works in a canning factory handling fourteen-pound cans of beef.
	Following this, Antanas (Jurgis’s father) gives a speech. He is sixty years old, but looks eighty. He and the rest of the family have only been in the United States for six months, but this is already affecting him adversely. He works in the pickle rooms at Durham’s and this is damaging his chest.
	The music begins again and the guests dance along. The older ones wear some item of clothing that is from their homeland, but the younger people avoid doing this. These younger people have assimilated more than their elders. Some of the dancers are described, such as Alena Jasaityte. She is the ‘beauty of the evening’ and paints cans all week in a factory.
	The next event is one of the most important of the evening. This is the acziavimas, which is a three or four hour uninterrupted dance and each guest dances and leaves money for the bride and groom. The wedding costs two even three hundred dollars and this is more than a man’s wages for a year. The vesilija is a form of compact where the guests eat and drink as much as they desire, but also give the married couple money. This tradition is changing in the ‘new country’, though, and some are leaving without donating anything. Jurgis says not to worry as he will work harder to pay the bills for the wedding.
	Chapter Two begins by explaining how Jurgis is still young and optimistic, and talks lightly about work. He is also naïve and has never lived in a city before. He met Ona and her family in Lithuania and her father initially refused him permission to marry her. Jurgis went back to see her a year later to ask again only to find her father had died and the family were now impoverished. This family now consisted of Ona, Teta Elzbieta, her six children and Ona’s brother Jonas. They all believed that coming to the United States would give them freedom and more opportunities. Before they set off, and at the last moment, Marija also decides to join them.
	When they arrive in the Packingtown district in Chicago, the smell of the stockyards greets them first. They are almost penniless once they reach here after being taken advantage of in New York (as they are clearly immigrants and know no English). They all stay at Aniele Jukniene’s home as she takes in lodgers. This is already overcrowded and ‘unthinkably filthy’. There are lots of children in the area, but no school and there is a fetid odor because this part of town is built on the city dump. Despite these conditions, Ona and Jurgis look out at Packingtown in awe.
	In Chapter Three, Jokubas, a fellow Lithuanian who runs a delicatessen, shows them around the area. The cattle pens alone take up half of a square mile. He takes them to Durham’s and shows them a room where hogs are killed and the sound of their pitiful shrieks is given in detail. Their deaths are also depicted; a chain is attached to one of their legs and they are swung on this chain before being killed. The factory is described as such: ‘It was porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics.’ The narrative continues to describe the unpleasant conditions and how the inspectors are lax in checking the hogs for tuberculosis.
	Descriptions then ensue of the killing of cattle and of how nothing of the animals is wasted at Durham’s. They are thought to furnish food for thirty million people. At this early time in the narrative, Jurgis thinks the workers should be grateful to have positions with such a company and is described as guileless.
	His first work is with Durham’s rivals, Brown’s. The bosses quickly choose him when he first waits for work, because he is young and has a large stature. Because of his naivety, he is unable to see that he is lucky to have been picked.

	Chapter One begins with the marriage of Ona and Jurgis and from Chapter Two to Chapter Seven the narrative takes the readers back to explain how the families arrived and settled in the United States, and how they saved for the wedding to take place.
	Chapter One is primarily concerned with describing how Ona and Jurgis are marrying in a traditionally Lithuanian way, and how these customs are being eroded for the worse in this new country. In the United States, the guests are less willing to pay after eating and drinking as much as possible. By beginning in such a way, the novel emphasizes immediately how the United States is having a detrimental effect on earlier traditions and how the cracks in the family’s American Dream are beginning to appear after being in this country for only a few months.
	Chapters Two and Three trace back to six months ago to when Jurgis and his father and Ona and her family came to the United States with hopes for a better future. The narrative is careful to reiterate how they innocently presumed that life would improve. This is most evident in the depiction of the central character, Jurgis, who at this early time still believes that he will be treated fairly. He is depicted as honest and willing to work, and it is also evident that he is naïve in the practices of the packers (the firms who kill the animals and produce the meat and by-products). He is in awe of companies such as Durham’s and Brown’s and is unable to see that he has only been chosen to work because of his age and build and neither of these advantages will last long with the hard work he has to undertake.

606,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 1,"Summary of Section I
 
The governess begins her manuscript in the first person describing her doubts as she takes a coach to Bly in June to assume her duties. When she reaches Bly, however, she is impressed by the beauty of the country and the grandeur of the house. Mrs. Grose is kind and respectful, and Flora is a beautiful child. The only thing that seems odd is that Mrs. Grose is overly glad to see her.  
 
The governess goes on about Flora's angelic beauty, but at the same time she is restless and thinks she hears unnatural sounds in the house, such as the cry of a child. Flora moves from Mrs. Grose's room into the governess's bedroom.  The narrator mentions to Mrs. Grose that she is thrilled with the situation and came to Bly be carried away as she was in London with the interview. Mrs. Grose seems to understand she means that she is smitten with her employer and mentions that she is not the first or last to be so charmed by him.
 
The narrator spends the day in getting acquainted with Flora outdoors on the grounds. She lets the child show her around.
 
Commentary on Section I
 
The narrator is an enthusiastic young woman of imagination, finding her situation romantic. She is naïve and impressed with her first situation away from home. Her first doubts are brushed away by the beauty of the antique mansion and the child. The housekeeper seems agreeable. Many readers have seen similarities between this narrator and Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Jane is also a parson's daughter in a strange old mansion with a mystery. This narrator has other similarities to Jane, such as her combined  passion and reason, and her love for an older employer. The governess is overwhelmed at the angelic quality of Flora, but there are hints that there could be something underneath the surface at Bly. She mentions that her moods went up and down in the first days, and this is what the narrative shows. First she is at ease, then disturbed, then dismisses her suspicions until something else comes up. She is trying to be happy at Bly, but gradually, she sees a hidden dimension.
 
",Turn of the Screw
607,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 2,"Summary of Section II
 
The narrator had been happy about the situation on the first day, but later a letter came by post from the employer. He had forwarded to her a letter from Miles's school, which he refused to open, passing it on to her to deal with. The governess cannot sleep that night because the letter is from Miles's headmaster saying he may never come back to school. They do not say what he has done. She asks if Miles is bad, but Mrs. Grose is indignant, saying he is only ten years old. Flora meanwhile has ignored her instructions from the governess to stay in the schoolroom and work, following her out while she speaks to Mrs. Grose. The narrator suddenly hugs Flora in her distress about Miles. Mrs. Grose implies there is nothing wrong with Miles being a little spirited and naughty, but the governess indicates there is a limit—if he is corrupting other children—
 
Later the governess asks Mrs. Grose about the previous governess. Mrs. Grose says she was young and pretty like the narrator is, and that's the way he liked them. There is a confusion about who “he” is, whether they are speaking of the employer, or someone else. Though Mrs. Grose does not want to gossip about the former governess, she admits she left Bly before she died. She was not ill but left at the end of a year. She died and did not come back. Mrs. Grose does not know what she died from.
 
Commentary on Section II
 
The governess narrator begins her investigation of the mystery of Bly. Miles's dismissal from school sets her off, and she questions Mrs. Grose if he is a bad boy. Mrs. Grose defends him, but it is significant that the governess is already using words like “contaminate” and “corrupt”(p. 12) to describe what he may have done at school to get dismissed. The letter contains no details of what Miles did. One might ordinarily assume that it could be something as common as some naughty prank or lack of discipline or poor grades. Presumably she assumes the worst because if it had been something ordinary, the letter would have said. The narrator says it can only mean he is “an injury to the others” (p. 11). This trait of the governess to jump to conclusions is what leads many readers to take her as the main villain of the story instead of the ghosts. On the other hand, if James is thinking of a governess like Jane Eyre, her jumping to conclusions could be taken as a sign of her sensitivity and intuition. She is shown to be uncommonly sensitive to nuances as we observe her thinking process. She picks up clues without having to be hit over the head with concrete data. For instance, though Flora seems to be a sweet angel, the governess begins to notice she does exactly as she likes: Flora has not followed her instructions to do her lessons, but instead is listening to her conversation with Mrs. Grose. It gives her a momentary doubt about Flora, just as she is wondering about her brother. The ambiguity about the narrator's character is the central issue for many readers and critics. Is she trustworthy or an unreliable narrator? Each reader has to decide. It is not a simple call, and James did not help his readers by giving his interpretation.
",Turn of the Screw
608,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 3,"Summary of Section III
 
When little Miles arrives from school during the summer break, the governess feels it is monstrous to assume he is bad, for he has the “same positive fragrance of purity” as his little sister (p. 13). The governess declares to Mrs. Grose that she will say and do nothing about the charges against Miles to the school, the uncle, or to Miles himself. Mrs. Grose says she will stand by that. Looking back on this, the narrator declares she was under a “great wave of infatuation and pity” (p. 14). She does not know why she was so confident to undertake the education of a young boy, thinking she could be his tutor. During the summer, she learned to how not to think about tomorrow and just enjoy the freedom of playing with the children. In this way, she was off guard.
 
During these long summer days and evenings, she likes best her own hour after the children are in bed, when she can be alone for walks or reading. She likes to think romantically how she is serving her employer by being exemplary. She feels in control. Just then, coming home, she sees someone standing on one of the towers of the house. At first she feels it is the man she is thinking of, her employer, on whom she has a crush. Then, she sees it is not him. She has a feeling of death. The man wears no hat and is staring at her. Then he moves but never takes his eyes from her.
 
Commentary on Section III
 
There is a shift toward complacency as the governess relaxes, deciding the children are blameless and wonderful. She gives herself up to a summer of enjoyment with them, not paying attention to the future and what will become of Miles's schooling. She assumes she will tutor him.
 
The summer evening after the children are in bed when she is alone is the time she first sees one of the ghosts, though she thinks it is a strange man standing on the tower watching her. There is a feeling of death associated with his presence, and this is a shock since she had been thinking in terms of love and pleasant possibilities of the future. James takes his time describing this first encounter and its effect on the governess. She seems to be recording an objective scene without interpretation. She wanted it to be her employer of whom she was having fantasies, but the figure is clearly seen to be someone else.
",Turn of the Screw
609,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 4,"Summary of Section IV
 
When she comes into the house, Mrs. Grose is waiting for her, wondering why she is late. The governess suddenly realizes that something bizarre has happened, because she is feeling fear and does not tell Mrs. Grose about the man on the tower. She is now on guard with senses sharpened but can find no explanation. She decides it was some sort of intruder.
 
She tries to forget the incident by enjoying the children. She still wonders about Miles getting dismissed from school but decides he is better off out of “the horrid unclean school-world” (p. 19). She goes overboard in seeing the total innocence of the children, as though they are cherubs without any history. There is nothing in them to punish. She thinks Miles has never suffered, or else she would have seen traces of it. He never speaks of school.
 
On a Sunday when she goes to the dining room to get a pair of gloves for church, she suddenly sees someone looking in the window at her. He is the same man that was on the tower, and she sees him from the waist up quite clearly. The man looks at her but also looks around, and she understands that he is looking for someone else. With great courage she runs outside to find him, but he is gone. She looks in at the window to see what he had seen, and in that moment, Mrs. Grose comes in the room, sees the governess at the window, and is frightened.
 
Commentary on Section IV
 
After seeing the man the first time, the governess wonders if there is a mystery at Bly as in stories like Mrs. Radcliffe's popular 1794 gothic novel, The Mysteries of Udolpho. Even now some part of her is aware that everything is too perfect, and she is under the spell of the children. At the second sighting, she receives a further shock by realizing the man is looking for someone else. A positive thing about the governess comes out here in that she conquers her own fear in her sense of duty to the children by running out to find the man. She does not understand why Mrs. Grose is frightened by seeing her out the window, however, except that her own face is white and ghost-like. She implies that Mrs. Grose may have also seen this apparition, but we find out that she has not.
 
",Turn of the Screw
610,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 5,"Summary of Section V
 
The governess describes the man she saw looking in the window to Mrs. Grose. She says he was not a gentleman, and she has seen him twice. She calls him a horror and does not want to leave the children to go to church. The man has no hat and red hair, athletic, handsome, not a gentleman but dressed in someone else's clothes. Mrs. Grose says they are the master's clothes, and it must be Quint, his valet, who sometimes wore the master's clothes. He was at Bly last year with the master, and when he left, Quint stayed and was in charge. Finally, Mrs. Grose admits that Quint is dead. 
 
Commentary on Section V
 
Each section is like the beat of a line of poetry, giving turns to the feelings of the characters, and to the reader. James always ends a section on a note of suspense or horror. In this way, each section is another “turn of the screw.”  The original story was published in weekly installments in Collier's Weekly Magazine in 1898, and so James always leaves the reader wanting more.
 
This episode represents the best case on the side of the governess that she has seen ghosts, for she describes Quint to Mrs. Grose in detail without knowing he is dead, and Mrs. Grose is able to identify him. Other incidents are more circumstantial and vague. We find out that Quint is like his master, handsome, a lady's man, and charming. He even wears his employer's clothes and no doubt likes to pretend he is the master of the house. He is terrifying to the governess for she perceives not only his ghost presence, but what he must have been like as a man. He was left in charge of the children, governess, and servants after the master left.
",Turn of the Screw
611,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 6,"Summary of Section VI
 
The governess and Mrs. Grose shut themselves in the schoolroom to discuss the events. Mrs. Grose has seen nothing, but according to the narrator, she is sympathetic to the governess, accepts that she is not crazy for seeing the ghost, and they pledge to see the thing through together. The governess claims the ghost was looking for Miles. Mrs. Grose asks how she knows, and she replies that she just knows, insisting that Mrs. Grose knows this too. The ghost wants to be seen by the children, she is sure. She believes she can protect the children from seeing the ghost by offering herself as the victim.
 
The governess thinks it odd that the children have never mentioned Quint to her. Mrs. Grose thinks Flora is too young to remember much, but Quint spent a lot of time playing with Miles, and it was his own idea to do this. Mrs. Grose mentions that Quint was too free with everyone. The governess reflects that she has never heard gossip among the servants about Quint, and Bly does not seem to have a bad reputation. The governess grills Mrs. Grose about Quint and asks if he was bad? Mrs. Grose says she thought so, but the master did not. She never told tales about Quint to the master because he did not like that sort of thing, and besides, she was afraid of Quint. He was clever and “deep” (p. 27).
 
Mrs. Grose says Quint was sent to the country on account of his health by the master. Mrs. Grose is reduced to tears by the governess's shock that Quint should be in charge of the children, for clearly she did not believe he should be but did not feel she had any power to do anything about it.
 
From this time the governess watches over the children’s' every move and rarely gets a good night's sleep. She had kept nothing back from Mrs. Grose but feels the housekeeper had not told everything because of her fear. So far the governess is more upset by Quint's life than his ghost. He was found dead on the road with a blow to the head, but the inquest did not find if it was murder or an accident because he slipped while drunk. In either case, his life seemed violent and full of vices.
 
The governess is sustained now by her own heroism; she wants to do something noble with her life and save the children. She will try to screen them from evil. One afternoon while on a walk with Flora, she is aware of a third person watching them across the pond. She feels it is a ghost without looking and then watches Flora to see if she sees the apparition, but Flora turns her back to it and remains busy building a toy boat.
 
Commentary on Section VI
 
This is a very tense section of the story as the governess confirms Quint's identity, manner of death, and his influence on the children. It changes her, for now she has a noble purpose to live for, to save these innocents from evil. In addition, she becomes aware of a second ghost.
 
Some modern readers think the governess heavy-handed in her inquisition of Mrs. Grose, coming to the conclusion that Quint was after the children. In her favor is the fact that she seems to record when Mrs. Grose disagrees with her or is reluctant to come to the same conclusion. Seeming not in her favor is her extreme judging and assumption of evil. Things are black or white in her vocabulary. She admits that she would have gone mad if she had not begun to find more proof (i.e., the second ghost).
 
It is important to understand the genre James is using. It has been pointed out that there is a theological background involved with this kind of horror story. The trappings of the ghost story assume good and evil, divine and demonic, damnation and salvation, because supernatural phenomena are the source of its horror. Souls that die peacefully in a state of grace do not walk around after death as ghosts. Ghosts are associated with violence, tragedy, and evil. Some ghosts might merely be frightening or hold secrets, but there is also a strong tradition that ghosts are damned spirits who try to take others with them, tempting them to walk over cliffs, or commit evil acts. The governess is the daughter of a parson and has led a sheltered life. She has been brought up on good and evil and the duty of adults to protect the innocent. This is her first confrontation with the world and its ways. From what we gather about Quint, he was indeed an unsavory character, and it does seem odd that the employer would put him in charge of children, but then he is a bachelor and does not want to be troubled with the children. Taken from this point of view, the governess's reaction is not unreasonable. She is quite aware that she is alone because no one else can verify the ghosts, and of course, this is also a formula for ghost stories. No one believes the one who sees the ghost. This increases the horror.
",Turn of the Screw
612,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 7,"Summary of Section VII
 
The narrator finds Mrs. Grose and tells her hysterically that the children know about the ghosts! She says that Flora saw a ghost. Mrs. Grose asks if Flora admitted it, and the narrator says that is the horror of it; she hid the fact that she could see it by turning her back and pretending to play. This time it was not Quint, but a woman in black. She is sure that this ghost is the former governess, Miss Jessel. She fixed her stare on the child as though she wanted her. The narrator describes the ghost she saw as beautiful and infamous. Mrs. Grose agrees that Miss Jessel was that. There was something between Quint and Miss Jessel, even though Miss Jessel was a lady and Quint, a servant. Mrs. Grose exclaims that Quint did whatever he liked, with all of them. The two women hint about why Miss Jessel had to leave Bly and why it was better she did so. The narrator bursts into tears exclaiming that she has not saved the children at all; “They're lost” (p. 33).
 
Commentary on Section VII
 
The narrator's horror keeps growing as she sees new pieces of the mystery. She claims she is clearly aware that Flora can see the ghost of Miss Jessel as she can. This is the point at which the governess loses credibility with many readers. Her proof that Flora sees the ghost is that she turns her back to it and pretends she cannot see it by playing with a toy boat. If the child were innocent, she would have cried out at seeing it. In the narrator's eyes, Flora's gesture shows that she is perfectly familiar with the ghost but does not want the governess to notice it. On the other hand, it could be that Flora really does not see it but is just playing. At this point, one trusts the governess or not. Once again, however, her description of Miss Jessel seems accurate according to Mrs. Grose who corroborates her notion that Miss Jessel was infamous. This word suggests that the ghost woman did not look innocent but fallen.
 
The two women do no more than hint at what must have happened, and the reader gets the message without explicit explanations. Miss Jessel and Quint were probably having a sexual affair, and perhaps Miss Jessel did not come back to Bly because of that. Mrs. Grose intimates that Quint had a lot of women. Why did Miss Jessel die? Perhaps suicide. The ghost always looks depressed, as though she knows she ruined her life. These impressions are left with the characters and readers, part of what James is trying to do—let the reader's imagination run wild, as the narrator's is doing.
 
The sin of the servant and lady is not the chief horror here. The governess bursts into tears because she believes the ghosts have already corrupted the children. Flora and Miles are not innocent, but playing a part to fool her. This is indeed a turn of the screw because children are generally not thought to be evil or corrupt. These children look angelic, but now the governess thinks they may be possessed by the ghosts.
 
",Turn of the Screw
613,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 8,"Summary of Section VIII
 
Mrs. Grose and the governess have a meeting at night in the governess's room to go over the facts. Though Mrs. Grose never sees the ghosts, the narrator reminds her that she was able to describe Quint and Miss Jessel in detail before hearing about them. That is her main defense. She is confused, however, to look into Flora's innocent eyes and to think that she could be a cunning liar. She goes over and over the experience with Flora, convinced she is right, so she asks Mrs. Grose again about Miles's behavior, whether he has ever been bad? Finally Mrs. Grose admits that Quint and Miles had been together all the time for several months. When she reminded Miles he should not spend so much time with a servant, Miles would make excuses or pretend Quint was his tutor. Miss Jessel had not objected.
 
At this point, the governess begins to badger and cross-examine Mrs. Grose to admit that Miles knew of the relationship between Quint and Miss Jessel, but Mrs. Grose backs down under this pressure. She turns on the governess, asking if she suspects Miles of concealing the nature of his relationship with Quint. The governess says she can only wait and watch.
 
Commentary on Section VIII
 
The horrors keep increasing. This section turns on what possible sexual knowledge the children, particularly Miles, may have. Did he know of the affair Quint was having?  It is implied that the children have somehow been initiated into sexual awareness by being with the governess and Quint, or perhaps worse. Quint might have been sexually abusing Miles. With all the evidence about Quint's character and his having his way with everyone,  it is suspicious that he was left alone with the boy. It was not really proper of the governess, Miss Jessel, to allow this, and even Mrs. Grose knows this, though there is not much they could have done if the employer left Quint in charge. There is no absolute proof of anything wrong, but James, through innuendos and the conversation between Mrs. Grose and the governess, conducted in incomplete phrases, makes it seem the mind of the governess is entertaining such a horrifying possibility. She repeats that at first she will not think this conclusion, and later, she says she cannot avoid thinking this.
 
The narrative forces characters and readers alike to contemplate the worst horrors one can imagine. We see the governess getting more desperate as she forces confessions from Mrs. Grose. She does make it clear, however, that Mrs. Grose is not ready to go this far in her assumptions, for Miles still looks like an angel. It is obvious from the first person narrative that the governess is feeling more and more stress and that it affects her. Does it overpower her sanity? That is a matter of interpretation. She always appears to try to go step by step in a rational  investigation, but the impressions she receives from Mrs. Grose are taking their toll on her. This again is part of the ghost story formula. Some innocent or unsuspecting person discovers an evil mystery and hovers on the brink of madness.

The governess admits that now it is hard to do her duties with her suspicions about the children. She is struggling against the conclusions she has drawn and hopes the children have not noticed her strange views of them. She thinks of them as blameless for their situation but “foredoomed” (p. 38), and this gives her more courage to take risks on their behalf. Even though she is wary, the children still have the power to charm her. At this time she feels they are “preternaturally fond” of her (p. 38), always trying to please her, while she is constantly trying to get to the bottom of their motives. She feels that Miles is under some influence, but though constantly in their company, she can prove nothing. She finds it strange that Miles and Flora always agree and are so close.
 
Now she finds that she has to turn the narrative once more to  a time after which there was nothing but pure suffering. At night, she becomes aware of something, takes her candle and goes out to the stairs where she meets Quint as a “living detestable dangerous presence” (p. 41) and they stare for a long time until he disappears as she watches him. She is exalted because she can meet him without fear.

When the governess returns to her room, she finds Flora not in her bed but hiding behind the curtain. She asks if Flora was looking for her out the window to see if she was walking on the grounds, and Flora replies she thought someone might be walking there, but she did not see anyone. The governess is convinced Flora is lying. Now the governess hardly sleeps and looks frequently in the hallway at night for the ghosts. One night she meets the woman ghost sitting on a stair with her back to the governess with her head in her hands in a gesture of woe.
Another night, the governess finds Flora out of bed at the window looking at something below. She goes to another window to see what Flora is looking at, and it is Miles out on the lawn.

The ghosts are active at night, and the governess sees the children are out of bed, watching the grounds, or even as Miles, out of bed and down on the grounds at night. It is a shock to see Flora and Miles both up at the same time, focused on something on the lawn.

They sit on the terrace and watch the children play innocently as the governess recalls her game of mental chess with Miles the night before. She had asked him why he was out on the lawn at night. He had made it into a splendid joke that he and Flora had constructed for her so that she might think he was really “bad.”
Commentary on Section XI
At this point, the reader's opinion of the events can easily go toward the innocence of the children because it seems more reasonable than the story of the governess. She believes that the two children, inspired by the ghosts, have made this elaborate trick to cover their tracks. She thinks they have routinely gone out to meet them. Miles is so charming, she has to accept what he says.

Mrs. Grose has not accepted her version of the story, even when she says what Miles said at the end: to imagine how bad he could be if he was really trying! The governess takes this statement seriously and not as a joke. She also takes it as a sign of guilt that neither child has ever alluded to Quint or Miss Jessel. Miles is reading to Flora, but as the two adults watch from the terrace, the governess declares they are not reading; they are speaking of the ghosts. She claims she knows she sounds crazy, but she is actually getting more “lucid” (p. 48). She tells Mrs. Grose that the innocence and beauty of the children are a fraud.  Mrs. Grose admits that Quint and Miss Jessel were wicked, but what could they do now? When the governess tells her what evil ghosts can do, Mrs. Grose says that their uncle must come and take them away. She asks the governess to write to him.
 
Commentary on Section XII
 
There is a question in this section of whether it is the governess instead of the children who has been corrupted. According to the governess, she finally convinces Mrs. Grose of the danger, but her words sound more and more hysterical instead of lucid, as she thinks. One wonders if Mrs. Grose wants the employer to get involved because she thinks the governess has lost her mind. The children appear innocent, but the governess has become completely cynical.  There are thus three possibilities for the reader now: the governess is making up the ghosts; the ghosts are real but the governess is losing it; the ghosts are real and wreaking havoc on the people of the house, including the children and governess. When the housekeeper suggests it is time to tell the employer, the governess backs off because she is so proud of handling this by herself. She wants to impress the employer, not give him trouble. The situation looks worse for the governess now.

The governess insists it was not her imagination. From this time the children are aware of her predicament. She sees their attitudes as ironic now instead of innocent. She feels aware of the forbidden ground of topics with them and feels she is their puppet, having to avoid what she really wants them to confess. Now it is autumn, and she no longer sees the ghosts, even though she claims her sensitivity has deepened. She longs to know the worst about her “obsession” with the ghosts (p.52).
 
Commentary on Section XIII
 
At times, the governess admits she wants to have it out with the children, but she cannot bring herself to say the names of Quint and Jessel. What saves them all is the idea that the uncle could sometime show up. Everyone seems to want this except the governess. The children write to their uncle, but she never posts the letters, thinking of his instructions about not being disturbed. They know she does not send the letters. This seems a bit controlling and cruel to the reader. From one point of view, it is not she who is their puppet, but they who are her prisoners. She treats them as if they are themselves Quint and Jessel. At one point she thinks the children are not even there; they are possessed.

Miles gains the upper hand here. His requests seem reasonable, and suddenly, the governess appears to be a tyrant. Miles apparently wants his uncle to know how he is being treated.

That night as the governess passes by Miles's room, he invites her in to talk. He admits he stays awake at nights thinking of their “queer business,” such as the way she is bringing him up (p. 62). She says of course he shall go back to school but it will have to be a new school. She tells him he has never ever mentioned his old school or his old life to her, hoping to open the door to the subject, but he does not say anything except that he wants to get away from Bly. He wants his uncle to come down to settle it, and he warns that she will have to explain a lot. He says he wants her to leave him alone. She tenderly says that she only wants to help him and asks what happened before he came home. Miles says nothing, but when she repeats she wants to save him, he shrieks, and the candle blows out.
 
Commentary on Section XVII
This is another ambiguous scene, which, on one side, seems to say that Miles feels he is being abused in some way by the governess and wants her to leave him alone. On the other hand, he never answers about what happened at school and shrieks when she says she wants to save him, as though whatever is possessing him is answering. One way James constructs these scenes is to make everyone speak in half sentences without finishing their thoughts. The reader is left to piece the scene together from fragments.

The next day the governess tells Mrs. Grose she has written the letter to the uncle, but she keeps it in her pocket. The children are perfect at their lessons, and the governess is struck by Miles's intelligence and gentlemanly character. She can hardly keep from staring at him, wanting proof that he is indeed wicked. She believes he knows about evil, but she wants to know if he ever acted on it.
 
Miles takes the governess to the schoolroom where he plays on the piano for her. Meanwhile, Flora has run off, and everyone joins in looking for her. The governess declares she is with Miss Jessel. She finally puts her letter on the hall table to be taken to town to the mail as she and Mrs. Grose search for Flora.
 
Commentary on Section XVIII
 
The governess believes Miles has tricked her so Flora can run off by herself to be with Miss Jessel, and then, when they can't find Miles, she thinks he has gone off with Quint. This forces her to put the letter out to be mailed to the uncle.

The governess takes Mrs. Grose to the pond and decides that Flora has taken the boat to the other side. They find the boat hidden in the trees. Little Flora comes out of the wood, and Mrs. Grose hugs her. The governess, however, has had it and asks her, where is Miss Jessel?
 
Commentary on Section XIX
 
The governess feels she no longer has anything to lose, so she says the name of the ghost deliberately to make Flora confess. This is putting everything on the line, for the housekeeper is there too who still acts as though she believes the governess.

Just then, the governess sees Miss Jessel across the pond and grabs Mrs. Grose's arm to show her—there! Mrs. Grose sees nothing and scolds the governess for scaring them, trying to soothe Flora. Meanwhile, Flora has looked reproachfully at the governess and told her she has never seen anything and thinks she is cruel. She asks Mrs. Grose to take her away from the governess. The governess knows she has lost Flora to Miss Jessel, and she begins weeping, full of grief. When she comes back home, Miles sits in her room with her in silence, as if to comfort her.
 
Commentary on Section XX
 
This scene is damning to the governess but does not diminish her certainty, for the ghost of Miss Jessel remains on the scene all while the other characters are talking and denying they see her. Miles comes to sit with the governess afterward in her room, and one can only suppose he feels sorry she has gone over the edge, or else that he wants company.

Mrs. Grose wakes the governess the next day saying that Flora is feverish and hysterical. She does not want to see the governess again. The governess still believes the ghost is making her act this way. She tells Mrs. Grose to take Flora away from Bly straight to the uncle in London. She will stay at Bly to see what she can do with Miles. She thinks Miles wants to confess. Mrs. Grose says that Flora is very bad, especially the language she uses. The governess takes this as a sign the ghost is possessing her, and according to her, Mrs. Grose says she believes the same and wants to get the girl away. The housekeeper also says that it appears Miles stole the letter to the uncle, and now Mrs. Grose believes that what he did at school was to steal things. The governess says the letter only contained a request for an interview with the uncle; it did not tell about the events. She hopes to get a confession from Miles so he can be “saved”(p. 79).
 
Commentary on Section XXI
 
A wary reader might read this conversation between Mrs. Grose and the governess in a more cynical way, as if Mrs. Grose is just confirming she believes Flora is very bad and must be taken away. The governess thinks Mrs. Grose is justifying her view that ghosts are corrupting the children. Now her only goal is to save Miles by making him confess. 
",Turn of the Screw
627,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 22,"Summary of Section XXII
 
Being left alone with Miles is another turn of the screw for the narrator who feels weak and in a tight place. No one else in the house, the servants, for instance, understand what has happened and stare at her. She girds herself to be heroic and firm. Miles is acting with complete freedom and goes off on his own. The governess is relieved of the pretenses they have been living under; all seems in the open now. Miles seems more conscious and intelligent now. He asks why Flora had to go, and the governess says because she is too ill to be at Bly.
 
Commentary on Section XXII
 
The governess has hardened her will to treat of what she thinks is a supernatural battle, involving the soul of Miles. She recognizes ten-year-old Miles as a remarkable person, and in fact, treats him as an adult. Some readers see her placing romantic expectations on the child because he is so precocious, and now, in her eyes, not innocent like a little boy. Like adults, they circle around one another, trying to feel out the situation, and sometimes the governess thinks Miles is trying to be her ally. 
",Turn of the Screw
628,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 23,"Summary of Section XXIII
 
It is November, and Miles looks out restlessly at the dreary landscape. Suddenly, the narrator feels that Miles is giving in. She tells him she has stayed at Bly just for him. There is nothing she would not do for him. He knows she wants him to tell her something. She is aware that he is afraid of her. He says he will tell her anything, but not now. He says he has to go out to see a friend. She says all right, if he will satisfy one point—did he steal her letter to his uncle?
 
Commentary on Section XXIII
 
One suddenly feels sorry for Miles, as it seems the governess is a tyrant keeping him a prisoner. Yet, though most of the time the two seem to speak in code or challenge one another indirectly, they are becoming more direct in their speech and actions. The governess thinks it is because Miles wants to confess, to have an adult on his side. On the other hand, Miles is very restless, not knowing what kind of power the governess may have over him. The governess brought the drama with Flora to a head by finally being direct and saying there was a ghost and giving it a name. She starts to close in on Miles in the same way, asking if he stole her letter. She makes this look like a compromise—they will not speak of the big thing, only a smaller one.
",Turn of the Screw
629,Turn of the Screw:Novel Summary: Section 24,"Summary of Section XXIV
 
While she waits for his answer, the governess stands and grabs Miles, keeping his back to the window, for looking in is Peter Quint “with his white face of damnation” (p. 85). She decides that unlike the incident with Flora, she must keep Miles unaware of Quint. She is fighting a demon for a human soul, she says. The boy's face is also white and perspiring. He confesses he took the letter. He is so nervous, she knows he is telling her the truth. He read the letter to see what she said about him. The apparition at the window temporarily disappears, and she thinks she has won.
 
She continues her cross-examination, asking Miles if he was expelled for stealing. He did not know she knew about his expulsion. He says he did not steal. He merely said things to other students, and they repeated it to others. The governess is elated that she is winning and keeps pressuring Miles for more details.
 
For one second, the governess gets a clear perception that perhaps Miles is innocent; that this is all there is to his behavior. And if so, then what is she? she wonders, knowing it would make her in the wrong. Nevertheless, she keeps pressing Miles about what he said to the other children to get him thrown out of school. Just then, she sees the ghost at the window again and feels justified that she must continue the battle. She cries out “no more!” to the window, and Miles asks, “Is she here?” (p. 88). She says it is not Miss Jessel, but points to the ghost out the window. Miles looks around and can see nothing, but is worked into a rage. Then he says, “It's he?” She asks whom he means and he names “Peter Quint—you devil! Where?” (p. 88). She points to the window but grabs Miles and says the ghost has lost; she has won. He jerks his face to the window and sees nothing but dies of shock in her arms.
 
Commentary on Section XXIV
 
For a modern reader, this final scene seems to implicate the governess more than any other, for though the ghost is visible, it is only to her. James, however, has carefully constructed the scene like others to be ambiguous, making interpretation of the story uncertain to the last. Miles knows that she had scared Flora with the ghost of Miss Jessel, and now he knows, whether he sees it or not, that she is threatening him with the ghost of Quint. She has pushed him to the extreme to get him to “confess” his doings with the ghost, but Miles does not see the ghosts. He confesses he stole the letter and used bad language at school to get expelled. No doubt he learned the language from Quint. Flora was also swearing at Mrs. Grose, making that lady believe the children might indeed have been corrupted. Miles seems to believe in the ghosts, however, even if he can't see them, and dies either of fright, or as the governess would like to think, of the exorcism. To the end, the governess believes that she saved Miles's soul, for she says that though his heart stopped, it was “dispossessed” (p. 88). From her point of view, the child can go to heaven at least and has been wrested from Quint.
 
The story stops here, though the reader would love to know what happened to the governess afterward. Was there an inquest into the death of little Miles? Was the uncle outraged? Did he believe the governess? There seems to be no blame attached to her, for later she is the governess of Douglas's sister, and he is impressed by her. The housekeeper may have corroborated her story as the governess says she does after seeing Flora's fits. A child swearing and speaking bad language as both Flora and Miles did would mean more to a Victorian audience than to a modern one, for a Victorian child speaking in this way might well be thought unnatural, either depraved or possessed by something speaking through it. When Miles is looking for Quint out the window where the governess is pointing, the text could be construed that he was wanting to find the ghost, and when he utters, “you devil!” it could be the ghost speaking through Miles to the governess. James is happy if the reader is kept thinking about it long after the story is over.

630,Turn of the Screw: Summary of Frame Narrative,"Text: James, Henry, The Turn of the Screw, edited by Robert Kimbrough, Norton Critical Edition, 1966.
 
Summary of Frame Narrative
 
The main story is embedded in a frame narrative, explaining the circumstance behind the story and its telling. A first-person narrator mentions that a group of people is gathered in an old house at Christmas time, telling ghost stories around the fire. Someone tells a case of a ghost visiting a child and how unusual that is. A man called Douglas says that if adding a child to a ghost story is a “turn of the screw,” what about two children? It is obvious he can best the story of one child, but he withholds his story until days later. The story of the haunting of the two children is written down and locked in a drawer at home. Douglas has to send his man to town to get the manuscript. While they wait for the manuscript Douglas excites the group by saying how horrifying the story is. It was written by a woman, now dead for twenty years. She sent him the manuscript before she died. The woman was charming, and ten years older than Douglas. She was the governess of his younger sister, whom he met on a visit home from college. They became friends, and she shared this story that she had told no one else. Someone asks if the governess was in love. Douglas says yes, but he won't say with whom. When he leaves the room, the guests speculate she was in love with Douglas. He has waited forty years to tell the story. The narrator further explains that Douglas gave the manuscript to him before he died, and from his transcription of the original, the text is now given to the public, some fifty years after the events.
 
Douglas explains as a prologue to the Christmas guests before reading the governess's story that she was the youngest daughter of a poor country parson. At the age of twenty she interviewed in London with a man for her first job as a governess. The man was a bachelor gentleman, handsome and in his prime. He charmed the young woman into taking the position at his country house in Essex called Bly, taking care of his orphaned niece and nephew, Flora, aged eight, and Miles, aged ten. There was a housekeeper at Bly called Mrs. Grose, but the governess would be the main authority there. He asks that she never under any circumstance contact him, but instead, handle everything herself. The children had been cared for by a previous governess who had died. Mrs. Grose has been taking care of the girl, and the boy has been sent to school. The governess only saw the employer in London twice but took the job because she fell in love with him, even though she knew she could never see him again.
 
Commentary on the Frame Narrative
 
A narrative frame gives us a story within a story. This frame introduces the tale and creates suspense, giving us a few details about the main characters. Douglas shares this introduction because he says the manuscript begins after the story starts when the governess is at Bly. It is necessary for him to tell the audience what he knows of the governess and the conditions of her employment. The narrative frame story happens about fifty years after the incidents at Bly. The tale comes up during a Christmas house party as the guests entertain themselves with ghost stories. It may seem an odd Christmas pastime but actually, telling such tales in the winter around the fire is an old tradition. Dickens had set his “Christmas Carol” ghost story in the same time of year.
 
The introduction of a frame occurring fifty years later creates distance and mystery. The story is not told directly by someone present but third-hand (governess to Douglas, Douglas to the guests, the frame narrator who could be James himself, to the reader). Already in the frame, we see that it will be hard to pin down exact details because of these embedded and multiple narrators. This has caused readers a lot of frustration, but James knows what he is doing as a teller of ghost stories. The guests begin to ask Douglas questions ahead of time about the story they are about to hear from him; for instance, what did the first governess die from? He says that the story will make it clear; he does not want to anticipate. A woman says, but that is exactly what you are doing—anticipating! This is the job of the mystery storyteller, to raise questions but not to answer them, in order to get the audience curious. The irony is that we never learn what the first governess died from, though there are hints.
 
Douglas also mentions the story is so horrible that he has never shared it, just as the governess only shared it with him. When the audience asks who the governess was in love with, Douglas again says that the story will make it clear, but the story is riddled with ambiguities. The listeners assume Douglas was in love with the governess himself, but he never says. The governess falls into a sort of adolescent love with her employer, because she has a romantic temperament. Even more importantly, she falls in love with the children, but whether that is a good thing or not, is left to the reader's imagination. Many frame stories surround the main story at the beginning and the end, but this frame is only at the beginning. Once the governess begins her story, there are no other comments upon it.
",Turn of the Screw
631,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"Act 1, scene 1
Richard III begins shortly after Henry VI, part 3, left off. The three Henry VI plays
depicted the struggle between Henry VI (the House of Lancaster) and the Duke of York (the House of York) for the throne of England in England’s Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century. Henry VI has been killed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and succeeded by Edward IV, who is also of the House of York.  Peace has been declared, but Richard now plots to seize the throne for himself, as he explains in his opening soliloquy. To achieve his goal, he must eliminate his rivals. He has managed to convince the king that their brother Clarence is the king’s enemy, and Clarence has been duly arrested.
Clarence enters, guarded. He is being taken to the Tower of London to be imprisoned. Richard feigns ignorance of the situation and asks Clarence what is happening. Clarence explains that he is being imprisoned because his name begins with the letter G (his name is George, Duke of Clarence), and the king has been told that his heirs will be killed by someone whose name begins with G. Richard knows this because he was the one who hatched the plot, but he pretends to know nothing about it. He tells Clarence that it is not the king’s wish that he be imprisoned but that of his wife Elizabeth, the former Lady Grey. Richard says that both Elizabeth and Margaret, the wife of the dead Henry VI,have a lot of power in the court. Richard commiserates with Clarence and promises to visit the king and ensure that he is freed.
After Clarence exits, Richard makes it clear that he is going to arrange for Clarence to be killed.
Lord Hastings enters. He has recently been freed from prison. (He is a supporter of the king but an enemy of the queen, which is why he was imprisoned.) Hastings brings the news that the king is sick. Richard pretends to think that is bad news.
After Hastings exits, Richard, alone, says that Clarence must die before the king does. (He does not want Clarence to have a chance at being crowned king.) He hopes that Clarence will be dead within a day, and that the king will die, leaving Richard a clear route to the throne. He then says he plans to marry Anne Neville, who is the widow of Prince Edward (the son of Henry VI), who was killed by Richard.
 
Analysis
Ideally, the reader or audience of Richard III should also be familiar with the trilogy that preceded it, Henry VI, parts 1, 2, and 3. Otherwise it can be hard to grasp the significance of all the characters and their relationships—like tuning into a TV miniseries just for the last episode. Richard III appears in Henry VI, part 3, and his character is presented from the outset as entirely evil. He already is plotting to seize the throne, and he murders both Prince Edward and Henry VI, when the king is imprisoned in the tower.
Richard’s opening soliloquy in this play is therefore no surprise to anyone who is familiar with how Shakespeare is telling the story of England’s Wars of the Roses. Richard makes no attempt to disguise his own nature in this and other soliloquies. He knows he is ugly (Richard was traditionally described as a hunchback) and has little hope of happiness through love. So he becomes a villain instead, with power his only goal. He is good at scheming, and he knows how to put on a show of rectitude and compassion.
In many of Shakespeare’s tragedies, the main character does not appear in the first scene or two, but minor characters give some clue to the audience as to how he is to be regarded. But not in this play. Richard bounds on stage right at the beginning, a full-fledged villain, completely unapologetic. He knows exactly who he is and what he is about. There is no subtlety here. It is safe to say that Richard III has no redeeming features at all, from the point of view of morality, although his wit and ability to stand back and observe himself constitute a well-developed sense of irony. 
",Richard III
632,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Act 1, scene 2
In a London street, Lady Anne is accompanying the corpse of her father-in-law, Henry VI, to its burial. She curses his killer, whom she knows to be Richard, who also killed her husband. Richard enters, and Anne is horrified. She calls him a devil and tells him to go away. Richard denies that he killed her husband, saying that it was Queen Margaretwho blamed him for the murder. Anne does not believe him and then asks Richard if he killed the king, Henry VI. This Richard does not deny. Anne says he is damned for it; hell is the only place for him.
Richard then takes the initiative and starts to woo Lady Anne. He says the only reason he committed murder was because of her beauty. Anne does not believe him. She just wants her revenge for what he did. Richard counters by saying that he loves her more than her former husband did. She responds by spitting at him. Undeterred, Richard continues to try to flatter and charm her, emphasizing the depth of his feelings for her. He even says that since it appears she cannot forgive him, he will give her his sword with which to kill him. She takes the sword but does not know how to use it properly. He tells her to try again, confessing that he did indeed kill King Henry and Prince Edward, saying he did it because of her beauty. She drops the sword, and he offers then to kill himself, if she should ask it of him. Anne tells him not to. He then offers her a ring, placing it on her finger. Anne appears to be softening in her attitude toward him.
Richard then offers to accompany the king’s body to his final resting place while Anne goes to Crosby House, where he will meet her later. He pretends that he repents of killing the king. Anne believes him and is delighted by his apparent change of heart.
After Anne exits, Richard soliloquizes. He expresses his surprise that he appears to be having some success with Anne, given the circumstances. He admits that he is only half the man that Prince Edward was. But then he changes tack, saying that, well, Lady Anne seems to find him a “marv’lous proper man,” so maybe he should think more highly of himself. He resolves to visit some tailors and get some new outfits.
 
Analysis
Richard shows here that he actually has some of the qualities that he denied possessing in the previous scene. In that scene he claimed not to have the skill of the lover on account of his ugly appearance. But here he is quite confident and indeed shameless in his dealings with Lady Anne. He has the presumption to think that he might have a chance with the woman whose husband he killed. Richard knows how to act a part when it fits in with his goals. He is very persistent in the face of her understandable hostility, and he seems to be able to master the language of courtly love. He even, at the end of the scene, expresses surprise at what he has managed to accomplish. Richard may be a villain, but he is a very self-aware one, and he shows that he is a master at manipulating people, whether in love or politics.
",Richard III
633,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 3,"Act 1, scene 3
At the royal palace, Lord Rivers tells QueenElizabeth that the king will soon recover. Lord Gray tells her to be cheerful around the king, to encourage him. Elizabeth is worried that if the king dies, her son Edward will be under the care of Richard, as Protector. She fears this because she knows Richard is not well disposed toward her and her family.
Buckingham and Stanley enter. They bring hope that the king is recovering. They also say that he wants to effect a reconciliation between Richard and the Queen’s brother (Rivers), and between Richard, Rivers, and Hastings.
Richard enters, demanding to know who is saying that he is not loyal to the king. He is indignant that he could be accused of such a thing. Queen Elizabeth tells him that it is the king himself who knows Richard is hostile to him, his wife, and her family. The Queen says she knows Richard envies the family’s advancement to the throne.
Richard accuses her of causing the imprisonment of Clarence, but she denies this. Richard makes some disparaging remarks to the Queen, and she protests.
Old Queen Margaret, the wife of the dead Henry VI, enters, at first unnoticed. Richard speaks out against the current queen, saying that he advanced the king’s interests in many ways, while she and her then-husband Grey (who is now dead), as well as Rivers, her brother, were actually on the Lancastrian side. He protests about Clarence’s imprisonment, saying that Clarence has always been the king’s supporter.
Rivers protests that they were merely showing their loyalty to the one who was at the time king. He says they would equally be loyal to Richard, should he become king. Richard says he has no desire to be king.
Queen Margaret, who has been speaking in a series of asides, now advances. She upbraids Richard for killing her husband and son and says that everyone in the room owes allegiance to her. Richard responds by reminding her of how his father, the Duke of York, cursed her when she abused and mocked him, and his curse fell upon her. It is, in effect, God who has cursed her, he says. The Queen and everyone else joins in denouncing Queen Margaret. Margaret responds by cursing the king and his son, hoping they will die untimely deaths. Then she curses everyone else present, including Richard, for whom she wishes an even worse fate than the others. She insults him with the most colorful language she can think of (“Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!”). She also warns the Queen that Richard will prove her undoing. She exempts Buckingham from her curses, since he was not involved in killing her family. She also warns Buckingham about Richard, not knowing that Buckingham is Richard’s ally.
Finally, Margaret finishes her curses and exits. Richard pretends to feel remorse for the wrongs done to her. The Queen says she never did anything to harm her, but Richard points out that she has benefited from the wrongs Margaret suffered.
Everyone present is called away because the King wants to see them. Richard remains alone. In a soliloquy, he admits to all his schemes. It is he who is responsible for getting Clarence imprisoned, but he has told Stanley, Hastings, and Buckingham that it is the Queen and her allies who are responsible. Meanwhile, he plots to be revenged on Rivers, Dorset (another son of the Queen), and Grey (also a son of the Queen).
Two murderers enter, hired by Richard. He shows them the death warrant that has been signed by the king, authorizing Clarence’s death.
 
Analysis
Richard continues to glory in his malevolence, and to confide in the audience about it. He is an accomplished liar, and some people seem convinced by his act.
This scene can be a difficult one for those who are unfamiliar with the preceding play, Henry VI, part 3. The events in that play concluded only a few years before the events in Richard III begin. Old Margaret, is, so to speak, a relic from the previous play. Historically, she was in France from 1476 until her death in 1482 and could not have participated in this scene. Perhaps Shakespeare included her here because he wanted to remind his audience of some of the events that took place in Henry VI part 3. This quarrel between the Lancastrians and Yorkists goes back a long way, and like many bitter quarrels, it has left a legacy of hatred and desire for revenge. Historically, Henry VI died in 1471 and Edward IV, who at this stage in Richard III is seriously ill, in 1483. Clarence was executed in 1478. As he often does in his history plays, Shakespeare telescopes events that took place over decades into a smaller time span so he can fit them into his plan with more dramatic economy. 
",Richard III
634,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 4,"Act 1, scene 4
In the Tower of London, Clarence talks with the guard. He says he dreamed the previous night that he had escaped from the Tower and was with Richard sailing for France. But Richard pushed him overboard and he drowned. Entering Hades, the underworld, which is also hell, he encountered other souls there, including his father-in-law, Warwick, who reproached him for turning away from the Lancastrian cause that he had once supported. As devils roared in his ears, Clarence woke up.
Tormented by the sins he believes he has committed for the sake of Edward, the king, Clarence prays to God that if God’s wrath is to fall on him, his wife and children should be spared. Clarence then sleeps.
Brakenbury, the Lieutenant, enters, followed by two murderers. The murderers carry a commission from the king that authorizes them to take charge of Clarence. Brakenbury does not inquire further as to their purpose but hands them the keys to the cell. Brakenbury and the guard exit.
The second murderer confesses to the first one that he is having some pangs of conscience about killing Clarence, even though they have a warrant from the king to do so. The first murderer reminds him of the money that Gloucester has promised them for carrying out the murder, and the other man forgets his misgivings.
Clarence awakes and sees the two men. Alarmed, he guesses they are there to kill him. Clarence asks what his offense is, that he is to be killed for it. He argues that he has not been legally tried and convicted. Therefore, he says, the men face damnation if they kill him, since to do so would be unlawful. The murderers respond that they are acting under the authority of the king, and that Clarence is guilty of supporting the Lancastrian cause. They also say that Clarence is guilty of killing Prince Edward, the son of the former king, Henry VI. Clarence points out that his brother, the current king, is also guilty of that act. Clarence tries to bargain with the murderers, saying they should go to see Richard, who will reward them well for not killing him. The murderers tell him the truth: Richard hates him and wants him dead. Clarence can barely believe this. He continues to try to argue his way out of his fate, but the murderers stab him. If he is still alive they plan to drown him in a butt of malmsey wine. 
The second murderer feels remorse at what they have done.
 
Analysis
Clarence does his best to argue his way out of an impossible situation but he never has a chance. Once again, understanding this scene depends on a knowledge of prior events, which are being to justify his murder. In Henry VI, part 3, Clarence at one point allies himself with Warwick in support of the Lancastrians rather than with his own brother Edward, because Edward did not provide him with a suitable wife. However, after Warwick appeared to renege on a promise to install Clarence as the heir to the throne, Clarence switched sides again, and was forgiven by his brothers Edward and Richard. Following the Battle of Tewksbury, Clarence helped to kill the captured Prince Edward. Now, in this scene, Clarence’s past is coming back to haunt him, although of course his past actions are simply being used as flimsy excuses to justify the murder.
Shakespeare has taken some liberties with history in order to present Richard as being behind Clarence’s death. In reality, Clarence was executed following a legal trial for treason, and the verdict, historians say, was not unjust. The historical Richard, it seems, loyal to his brother, tried to intervene to prevent the execution.

635,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 1,"Act 2, scene 1
At the royal palace in London, King Edward, who is very sick, presides over a reconciliation between feuding factions. First, Hastings and Rivers, the Queen’s brother, are reconciled. The Queen, her son Dorset, and Buckingham join in the general reconciliation. Richard enters and pledges friendship to all in the room. But then the Queen mentions Clarence’s name, and Richard says Clarence is dead. This is news to everyone, and they are all shocked. The king says that the order to kill Clarence was revoked; Richard responds that the counter order came too late.
Lord Stanley, also known as the Earl of Derby,enters. He asks the King if the life of a servant of his might be spared, even though he killed a man. The King responds by musing on the life of Clarence, regretting his death. He recalls how Clarence, after he forsook Warwick’s cause, remained loyal to him. And yet, the King says, no one came to him to plead for Clarence’s life, and now even a servant has someone pleading for his. He grants the favor to Stanley.
The King and Queen and others exit, leaving Richard and Buckingham. Richard tries to blame the Queen’s family for Clarence’s death.
 
Analysis
As the King’s death approaches, there is antagonism between the Queen’s family, the Woodvilles, and those who are more loyal to the King’s side of the family. Dorset and Rivers, for example, are Woodvilles, whereas Hastings and Buckingham are loyal to the king. Richard of course merely pretends to be part of the general reconciliation. Motivated only by personal ambition, he is against anyone who is likely to obstruct his path to power; it doesn’t matter which side of the family they are on.
Historically, the marriage of the widow Lady Grey, formerly Elizabeth Woodville, to Edward IV, by which she became Queen, allowed the Woodville family to gain a lot of power in the land. Some of the more established lords resented this, and regarded the Woodvilles as upstarts.

636,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 2,"Act 2, scene 2
The Duchess of York, the mother of Edward, Clarence, and Richard, mourns the death of Clarence. She talks to Clarence’s two young children, Edward and Margaret. The boy tells his grandmother that Richard told him the king was to blame for Clarence’s death, but the duchess knows better. She knows that Richard is full of deceit. Queen Elizabeth enters, with Rivers and Dorset. The Queen announces that the King is dead. Both women mourn their loss. Dorset and Rivers try to comfort the Queen. Rivers advises her to send for Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, immediately and have him crowned king.
Richard, Buckingham, Stanley, Hastings, and Ratcliffe enter. Richard offers his comfort to both women but offers a cynical aside. Buckingham is anxious to preserve the recently established unity between the quarreling factions. He advises that the prince should be brought from Ludlow to London accompanied only by a very small escort, because too big an entourage might antagonize those elements that are still opposed to the Yorkist supremacy. Richard and Rivers agree to this plan. When Buckingham and Richard are left alone, they plot to separate the prince from the Queen and her family.
 
Analysis
The death of the King is obviously good news for Richard, who is prepared to make an ally of Buckingham to achieve his goal. Shakespeare, as he does throughout the play, spurns no opportunity to blacken Richard’s character, as here when the grandson of the duchess unwittingly reveals Richard’s hypocrisy and lies. Richard, the boy reports, told him it was the king who was responsible for imprisoning Clarence, the boy’s father, and offered the boy every sympathy: “he wept, / And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek; / Bade me rely on him as on my father, / And he would love me dearly as a child.” Even Richard’s mother knows this is just a pretense and that her own son is full of lies and malice.

637,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 3,"Act 2, scene 3
In a London street, three citizens discuss the news of the death of the king. Thesecond citizen fears what will happen now. The third citizen does not relish the prospect of a child on the throne (the Prince of Wales is only twelve years old), but the second citizen, now looking on the bright side, says it will be fine, because the young king will have a council rule on his behalf while he is a minor. But the third citizen doubts whether there are any wise nobles. He does not trust Richard or the Queen’s family.
 
Analysis
This short scene shows how the general population views the situation. The third citizen, who is most apprehensive about what may happen, is given the most lines, and the others are uneasy, although they hope for the best.

638,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 4,"Act 2, scene 4
Queen Elizabeth, her mother-in-law the Duchess of York, and the Archbishop of York talk about what is happening. The archbishop says that the young prince will be in London by the next day or the day after that. A messenger enters, interrupting some playful talk between the adults and the Queen’s young son (the young Duke of York). The messenger reports that the prince’s escorts, Rivers, Grey, and Sir Thomas Vaughan have been imprisoned at Pomfret on the orders of Buckingham and Richard. This means that the latter pair have taken control of the prince. Fearful of their future, the Queen (the prince’s mother) decides to seek sanctuary and take her son with her. The duchess says she will come, too. The archbishop says he will do everything in his power to protect them.
 
Analysis
The plot moves swiftly forward as Richard takes a clear step toward seizing the throne. He is now in control of the young heir to the throne and has some of his enemies imprisoned.

639,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"Act 3, scene 1
Edward, the young Prince of Wales, arrives in London. He is greeted by Richard, Buckingham, and others. The prince says he wants more of his uncles there, but Richard tells him that the men he is referring to were false friends. The prince does not believe him, however.
Hastings arrives with the news that the Queen and her son, the prince’s brother, have sought sanctuary. The boy wanted to come to meet his brother, but the Queen refused to let him go. Buckingham tells Cardinal Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to persuade the Queen to send her son to London, by force if necessary. The Cardinal protests that it would be a sin to take him against his mother’s will, since they have sought sanctuary, but Buckingham replies that sanctuary does not apply to children, since they do not freely choose or claim it.
Richard tells the Prince of Wales that he, the prince, will be staying for a few days in the Tower of London. The prince says he does not want to stay there.
Hastings arrives with Richard, the young Duke of York, the Prince of Wales’s brother. York speaks with a thinly disguised hostility to Richard, and when he learns that he and his brother are to be staying at the Tower, he expresses his displeasure. Richard asks him what he fears, and York replies the ghost of Clarence, since he has heard that his uncle was murdered there. The two boys, however, agree to go to the Tower.
Everyone exits except for Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby. Buckingham suggests that York is hostile to Richard because his mother the Queen put him up to it. Buckingham then consults Catesby about the plan to install Richard as king. Buckingham asks Catesby about Hastings. Could he be persuaded to support them? Catesby says that Hastings is a strong supporter of the former king and therefore of his son. Buckingham then inquires about Stanley. Catesby replies that Stanley will follow whatever Hastings does. Buckingham sends Catesby to sound out Hastings and see if he can be persuaded to support their plan. Richard then tells Catesby to inform Hastings that Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan, Hastings’s enemies, have been executed at Pomfret.
After Catesby exits, Buckingham asks Richard what they will do if Hastings refuses to support them. Richard gives a blunt reply: cut off his head. He tells Buckingham that when he, Richard, is king, he will make Buckingham the Earl of Hereford, as well as giving him all the former king’s personal property.
 
Analysis
This scene briefly alludes to the historical fact that after Edward IV’s death, Richard was named Protector, as Edward had requested. This is why Prince Edward in this scene refers to Richard as Lord Protector (line 160). It was no surprise that Richard was appointed to this position. As Peter Saccio explains in Shakespeare’s English Kings, “Richard was, after all, the only surviving adult male in the house of York, a loyal, long-tested prop of the Yorkist throne, and the most powerful man in the realm” (p. 169).
Richard efficiently goes about eliminating his enemies. If Hastings cannot be won over, he must be killed, just as Rivers and his associates (all supporters of the Queen and the Woodville family) are to be executed. So keen is Shakespeare to keep the villainy of Richard front and center that he foreshadows, in this scene, the fate the two princes will meet in the Tower. This comes in lines 89-90, when Richard says in an aside, after he has been speaking with the young Prince of Wales, “So wise so young, they say, do never live long.”
",Richard III
640,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 2,"Act 3, scene 2
At Lord Hastings’ house, a messenger arrives from Stanley early in the morning. As a result of a dream, Stanley is worried about the threat he perceives from Richard. He wants Hastings to accompany him to the north, to escape the danger. Hastings dismisses Stanley’s fears, saying that he, Hastings, will hear soon enough (from his friend Catesby) about anything that is said concerning them at an upcoming council Richard has convened. He is confident they have nothing to fear.
Catesby enters on his mission from Richard and informs Hastings that Richard is plotting to seize the crown. He says Richard has sent him with this news, wanting to know whether Hastings will support him. Catesby also mentions that the three noble prisoners at Pomfret are to be executed. Hastings does not care about the executions, since Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan are his enemies, but he says he would rather die than allow Richard to win the crown. Hastings, however, is not troubled by the news. He feels secure, believing that Richard and Buckingham are his friends.
Stanley enters, and says he feels uneasy about the current situation, but Hastings reassures him that there is nothing to worry about. Hastings remains confident as he talks to a pursuivant (a messenger) and to a clergyman. Then Buckingham enters and informs Hastings of the impending deaths at Pomfret. Buckingham and Hastings both go to the Tower.
 
Analysis
Hastings is almost comically overconfident and shows that he has completely misjudged Richard. He has no idea at all of the depths of the man’s malevolence, and even thinks him to be a friend. Hastings’ gullibility is also a tribute to the charming face that Richard can put on when he wants to disguise his real purposes.
",Richard III
641,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 3,"Act 3, scene 3
At Pomfret Castle, Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan are led to their deaths. They all speak defiant words to Sir Richard Ratcliffe, who is supervising the executions. Rivers recalls that it was at the same castle that Richard II was murdered. Grey and Rivers recall the curse uttered by Margaret, Henry VI’s wife (this is a reference to Act 1, scene 3), on everyone who had wronged her, including them. Rivers implores God also to have vengeance on the others who were cursed by Margaret, including Richard, Buckingham, and Hastings.
 
Analysis
This is a small glimpse of one theme of the play, that of retribution. Rivers cannot know that Hastings will within a few days pay the same price as he, Rivers, is now paying. Ultimately, however, it is not the curse of one person that is worked out in the play, but the divine retribution that will eventually fall on Richard for his evil deeds (at least that is how Shakespeare will present it the resolution of the play). 
",Richard III
642,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 4,"Act 3, scene 4
Buckingham, Stanley, Hastings, the Bishop of Ely, and others, hold a council meeting. The purpose is to make plans for the upcoming coronation. Richard has not yet arrived, but Hastings is confident that he can speak for Richard. Richard then arrives, and when Buckingham tells him that Hastings was prepared to speak on his behalf, Richard expresses no displeasure, saying that Hastings knows him well.
Richard then takes Buckingham aside and informs him that Hastings is not prepared to support Richard in his claim to the throne. The two men exit.
Hastings remarks to Stanley that Richard holds no enmity for anyone in the room; had he done so, Hastings says, he, Hastings, would have seen it in Richard’s face.
Richard returns and reports a plot on his life. The Queen and Jane Shore (Edward IV’s mistress) practiced witchcraft against him, he says. Hastings makes the mistake of not immediately acknowledging the reality of the plot. He says that “if” they are guilty, but Richard interrupts him and accuses him of protecting Jane Shore. That makes him a traitor, and Richard orders his immediate execution. Richard exits, leaving Hastings to lament his fate and that of his country. He realizes he should have acted sooner and taken Stanley’s warning more seriously. Like the victims at Pomfret, just before his death he recalls the curse of Margaret.
 
Analysis
Once again Shakespeare draws attention to Hastings’s overconfidence and poor judgment of character. By doing so he makes the moment when Richard pounces more dramatically effective. Historically, Hastings was not quite as innocent as he appears in this play. He did plot with the Queen and her relatives to overturn the stipulation in Edward’s will that Richard should be made Protector. But of course, an innocent Hastings makes better drama because it better shows up the villainy of Richard. 
",Richard III
643,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 5,"Act 3, scene 5
Richard and Buckingham enter, both dressed in rusty armor and looking like men who have been in battle for their lives. The mayor of London and Catesby enter, quickly followed by Lovel and Radcliffe, who holds the head of Hastings. Lovel says Hastings was a traitor, and Richard makes a big show of how much he loved Hastings and would never have suspected him of such a deed. Gloucester tells the mayor that Hastings was plotting to kill both him and Richard that very day. Richard adds that not only were their own lives at risk, but so was the peace of England. Buckingham pretends to the mayor that they would sooner have waited until the mayor had had a chance to hear Hastings confess his crimes, and then the mayor could have explained the situation to the citizens, who otherwise might misconstrue what happened and lament Hastings’ death and blame Richard and Buckingham.
The mayor is convinced that Hastings must have been guilty. He says he will convey this to the citizens.
Richard tells Buckingham to go after the mayor and to the Guildhall and when the time is right, say that Edward IV’s children are illegitimate. Moreover, Richard says, Buckingham must insinuate that Edward himself was illegitimate, having been conceived at a time when Richard’s father, the Duke of York, was at war in France.
Richard then sets in motion a plan to hide the children of Clarence and make sure that no one gets to see the two princes in the Tower.
 
Analysis
Shakespeare follows his sources in respect of the illegitimacy of Edward’s children. It had been reported that Edward had engaged in a secret premarriage contract with Lady Eleanor Butler before his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. Such a contract was considered legally binding, so his marriage to Elizabeth was invalid and the children of that marriage illegitimate. However, since Eleanor was now dead, such a contract could not be proven.
The charge that Edward himself was illegitimate is not taken seriously by modern historians, who do however note that it was a story that circulated at the time, propagated by both Warwick and Clarence. In the play, Richard has little compunction about tarring his mother’s reputation in this way. 
",Richard III
644,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 6,"Act 3, scene 6
A scrivener enters with the indictment of Hastings that is to be read that day in St. Paul’s Cathedral. The scrivener says he has spent eleven hours copying it after it was sent to him the previous night by Catesby. The scrivener guesses that the charges against Hastings are false, but he also doubts whether anyone will have the courage to say so.
 
Analysis
This scene hints at an atmosphere of fear in the land. The powerful can literally get away with murder. It bodes ill for the country. 
",Richard III
645,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 7,"Act 3, scene 7
At Beynard’s Castle in London, Buckingham reports back to Richard about what he has achieved. He reported at the Guildhall that Edward and his children were illegitimate, citing Edward’s betrothal to two different women before he married Elizabeth—to a Lady Lucy and then to a French noblewoman, a match that was negotiated by Warwick and the King of France. Then Buckingham lauded the virtues of Richard. At the end, he invited his audience to cry “God save Richard, England’s royal king!” But no one uttered a word in response. Buckingham gets the mayor to repeat his speech, but again, no one acclaims Richard as king, save a few of Buckingham’s own supporters at the end of the hall.
The mayor has now come to the castle, and Buckingham has a plan: Richard is to be unavailable until he is persuaded reluctantly to appear. He must have clergymen with him. Then Buckingham will praise Richard’s piety, but Richard must not immediately accept what Buckingham and his supporters are urging him to do.
The mayor enters with a crowd of citizens, followed by Catesby. Catesby says that Richard is engrossed in meditation with the clergymen; they should visit him another day. Buckingham tells Catesby to make another request to Richard, saying it is important that they should see him. Catesby exits.
Buckingham praises Richard’s piety to the mayor, contrasting him favorably with the former king, who had a reputation for lechery. Buckingham says Richard would make a good king, but he fears that Richard will not accept the crown if it is offered to him.
Catesby reenters, saying that Richard wonders why they are all assembled there, and he fears they mean him ill. Buckingham tells Catesby to reassure Richard on that point.
Finally, Richard appears, between two bishops. Catesby also returns. Buckingham once more praises Richard’s piety, and Richard apologizes for keeping them waiting. He asks them what they want. Buckingham gives a long speech in which he urges Richard to take the crown because otherwise the country will languish under illegitimate rule. He insists that Richard has a right to inherit the throne.
Richard thanks him but declines, citing his unworthiness. He claims humility, and the knowledge that his flaws are too great to permit him to be king. He then says there is no need for a new king, since there is an heir who as he matures will prove a capable king. Buckingham responds by pointing out that Edward’s children are not legitimate, and therefore the crown is rightfully inherited by Richard. The mayor and Catesby urge him to accept. But Richard repeats that he is unworthy and cannot do as they say. Buckingham responds by once more lavishly praising Richard and saying that if he does not accept the crown, he, Buckingham, and others, will place someone else on the throne, not Edward V, but someone whose rule will result in Richard’s downfall.
All but Richard and Catesby exit. Catesby urges Richard to call them back. Richard finally gives in. Catesby calls them back, and Richard tells Buckingham and the rest that he will accept the crown, even though he does not want to. Buckingham salutes him as King Richard and says they will crown him tomorrow.
 
Analysis
The Lady Lucy that Buckingham mentions in this scene is a reference to Elizabeth Lucy, a mistress of Edward IV before he became king. But historically it was not Lucy with whom Edward made a marriage precontract with, if indeed he did so with any woman.
The second part of the scene, after the mayor and the citizens enter at line 61 is an example of dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience, or some of the characters, know things about the situation or the motivation of the characters that either all or some of the characters do not know. In this scene the audience knows what the mayor and the citizens do not, that this is an elaborate sham perpetrated by Buckingham and Richard. They are both good actors, conspiring to present Richard as a pious man who is so humble he feels he does not deserve the office of king and has to be repeatedly persuaded to accept. Buckingham and Richard play their parts to perfection. They have to, because as the first part of the scene showed, Richard does not in fact enjoy much public support.

Outside the Tower, the Queen, her son Dorset, the Duchess of York, Richard’s wife Anne, and Clarence’s daughter have come to visit the two princes. But the Lieutenant Brakenbury will not let them in, on the orders of Richard. The Queen and the duchess protest, to no avail.
Stanley enters and tells Anne that she must come with him to Westminster to be crowned Richard’s queen. She is heartily displeased at this news.
The Queen, knowing that Richard’s accession means more trouble for her family, tells Dorset to join the Duke of Richmond in France (Henry Tudor) where he has taken refuge. Anne rehearses the story of her wooing by Richard, and describes a marriage she bitterly regrets. She has never slept well because Richard is always being awakened by bad dreams. She believes Richard hates her and will soon dispose of her. She also tells the Queen to seek sanctuary.
 
Analysis
This is the first mention in this play of Henry Tudor, the Earl of Richmond. He is the future Henry VII who will soon put an end to the Wars of the Roses and unite the two houses of York and Lancaster. In Henry VI, part 3, Henry was still a boy, and he was sent to Brittany, France, to keep him safe.

Richard has been crowned king. He confides in Buckingham that his wish is to have the two princes in the Tower killed. Buckingham says he needs time to think about this, which does not please Richard, who decides that he will no longer confide in him about his plans.
Richard tells Catesby to start a rumor that Anne, his wife, is sick and may die. He also wants to get Clarence’s daughter married off to some inconsequential man who will present no threat to him. After Catesby exits, Richard says that he wants to marry Edward IV’s daughter, Elizabeth, to give him a firmer grip on the throne.
Richard then hires a man named James Tyrrel to kill the two princes.
Buckingham reenters. He tries to talk to Richard about the subjectRichard raised earlier, but Richard has his mind on the developing political situation. He is worried about an alliance between Dorset and Richmond. Buckingham wants reassurance that he will receive the earldom of Hereford and the personal property of Edward VII, just as Richard had promised him, but Richard is in no mood to listen. He is worrying about a prophecy made by Henry VI that Richmond would become king, and also a prediction made by a bard in Ireland that Richard would not live long after he saw Richmond. Buckingham broaches the subject again but Richard does not want to be bothered by it.
Richard exits, and Buckingham decides to flee to Brecknock before he meets the same fate as Hastings.
 
Analysis
Richard is utterly immoral and ruthless but also impresses the audience with his cold efficiency as well. He is completely aware of all aspects of the political situation and determined to arrange everything to his own advantage. He may be king but he is certainly not secure while the two princes live, especially Edward, the elder son of Edward IV, whom many would regard as the legitimate heir. If he can get Edward killed, neutralize any possible challenge from a husband to Clarence’s daughter by ensuring that she marries someone of no significance, and then himself marry his brother’s daughter, Elizabeth, he will be set fair. Obviously on his mind, though, is the threat presented by Richmond, who also has a claim to the throne.

Tyrrel enters. He hired two ruffians who have killed the two princes in the Tower. Richard enters and Tyrrel gives him the news. Richard asks whether he actually saw them dead, and he says yes. The corpses are buried, he says, but he does not know where.
Tyrrel exits, and Richard reviews the situation: Clarence’s son is imprisoned; Clarence’s daughter is married to a man of no account; Edward’s sons are dead; Anne is dead, or as good as (he gives no details). All that remains is for him to marry Elizabeth, which he must do speedily, since Richmond also has designs  on her.
Ratcliffe enters with the news that Morton, the Bishop of Ely, has joined Richmond, and Buckingham has raised an army against Richard. Richard is more troubled by the developing strength of Richmond than he is by Buckingham. He decides to act quickly and tells Ratcliffe to raise an army.
 
Analysis
Events are moving swiftly now and most appear to be in Richard’s favor. But he has reason to be worried about Richmond and is not yet secure on the throne. Needless to say, his malevolence has reached new heights with the murder of the young princes. Only on the throne for a short while, he has become a bloodthirsty tyrant.

649,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 4,"Act 4, scene 4
In front of the palace, Queen Margaret, Henry VI’s widow enters. She is about to depart for France but hides when she hears the Duchess of York and the Queen approaching. They are both mourning their losses. Margaret then comes forward and tells them to listen to the story of her own misfortunes, which have been many. She wants revenge on Richard and prays to God that he may die.
After Margaret exits, Richard enters. He is at the head of an army. The two women (his mother and his former sister-in-law) accuse and curse him. His mother tells him that he “camest on earth to make the earth my hell.” She curses him again and says she is praying that his enemies will be victorious. He will meet a bloody end, she says.
After the Duchess exits, Richard tells the Queen that he must talk to her about her daughter, Elizabeth. The Queen immediately thinks that the girl’s life must be in danger. She resolves to say anything to save her, including the claim that she is not really Edward’s daughter. She denounces Richard, while he insists that his intentions are not at all what she thinks. He says he will bring good to the Queen and to her daughter. Eventually he gets round to saying that he loves Elizabeth and wants to marry her. The Queen is incredulous and mocks him, but Richard tries to answer all her objections. He says he will forgive Dorset (her son) and the other rebels and give them all high office. Then he asks the Queen to go to her daughter and explain Richard’s intentions. The Queen asks him more questions to test his sincerity. She is skeptical and hostile to him but finally agrees to go to her daughter and get her to listen to his proposal. After the Queen exits, Richard makes a contemptuous remark about her.
Ratcliffe and Catesby enter. Ratcliffe says that Richmond’s powerfularmy is sailing for England, hoping when they land to connect with Buckingham’s forces.
Richard tells Ratcliffe and Catesby to round up support from the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Salisbury.
Stanley enters and confirms the news about Richmond, who is coming to England to claim the crown. Richard speaks harshly to him, doubting his loyalty, but Stanley says he will round up his forces and meet up with Richard wherever the king wants. Richard still does not trust him. He insists that Stanley leave his son behind. If Stanley should prove unfaithful to Richard’s cause, his son will be executed. Stanley exits.
Messengers enter with the news that the rebel forces are getting stronger as more men of substance in different parts of England join their cause. Buckingham’s army has been dispersed but no one knows where Buckingham himself is. There is a rumor that Richmond’s fleet has been destroyed by a storm and he is on his way back to Brittany. But this is soon discounted by another messenger who brings the news that Richmond has landed at Milford (this is Milford Haven in Wales) with a large army. The messenger also says that Buckingham has been captured. Richard resolves to march to Salisbury, and order that Buckingham be brought there.
 
Analysis
Richard here offers something of a reprise of the scene in Act 1, when he succeeded in wooing Lady Anne, despite the fact that he killed her husband. In this scene Richard is in an immeasurably more powerful position and his unfortunate former sister-in-law, Elizabeth, is in the end left with little choice but to go along with the wishes of the man who has just killed her two sons. Richard of course makes promises about pardoning the rebels that he has no intention of keeping. Not constrained by any integrity, Richard says in any situation the words he considers most likely to advance his ambition and lust for power.

Sir Christopher says that Richmond is in Pembroke in Wales, and he names all the men of substance who have joined Richmond’s cause. They are making their way to London.
 
Analysis
This scene shows that Richard was right not to trust Stanley. He had good cause, too, since Stanley’s wife is Richmond’s mother (by Henry Tudor) and therefore Stanley is Richmond’s stepfather. Therefore refusing to allow Stanley’s son to leave was a good move, from Richard’s point of view. Nonetheless, the list of his enemies seems to grow by the minute.

Buckingham is being led to his execution. He has asked to see Richard, but Richard has refused. Buckingham is resigned to his fate. He realizes he has acted wrongly by siding with Richard, plotting with him, and thereby betraying Edward IV’s family.
 
Analysis
In his portrayal of Buckingham, Shakespeare follows his sources, in this case the historian Edward Hall. It was Hall who wrote that Buckingham turned against Richard because Richard reneged on a promise to create him earl of Hereford. Historically, this is untrue; Richard did keep his promise in that respect (although Shakespeare was not to know this). Modern historians have reached no firm conclusions about why Buckingham mounted his rebellion so soon after helping Richard to the crown. Whatever the reason, he had no success. Plagued by bad weather, his army deserted him. He was executed on November 2, 1483.

Analysis
This is Richmond’s first appearance in the play. He is presented as a man who comes to overthrow a tyrant and has the welfare of England in mind. He does not act out of personal ambition.

At Bosworth Field, the two armies are encamped. Richard enters with some of his men. Norfolk says the enemy army numbers six or seven thousand men. Richard says he has three times that number. He calls on the men to pitch their tents, for the battle will be tomorrow.
They exit, and Richmond and some of his men enter. Richmond plans his tactics for the battle. He gives Blunt a note to take to Stanley, who is encamped just south of the king’s forces. Richmond and his men withdraw into their tent.
Richard, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, and Catesby enter. It is nine o’clock in the evening. Richard sends a message to Stanley, to bring his army up before sunrise, or his son will die. Richard feels uneasy, and sends for ink and paper. He then withdraws alone into his tent.
Stanley enters and addresses Richmond. Stanley says he will aid Richmond in the battle but cannot be too overt about it, owing to the predicament of his son. After Stanley exits, Richmond is left alone. He prays to God for success in the next day’s battle and then sleeps.
The Ghost of Prince Edward, Henry VI’s son, appears to Richard in a dream and reminds him of how he, Richard, stabbed him to death when he was a young boy. The Ghost tells him to despair, and die. The Ghost then appears to Richmond in a dream. He tells him to be cheerful because the souls of all those who have been wronged will fight on his behalf.
The Ghost of Henry VI appears to Richard. He too was killed by Richard, and like the Ghost of Prince Edward, he now tells Richard to despair and die. The Ghost then appears to Richmond and comforts him, describing him as virtuous and holy, and saying he will be victorious.
The Ghost of Clarence appears to Richard. He reminds Richard of his responsibility in Clarence’s death and has the same message for him that the other Ghosts have had: despair and die. To Richmond, he says that although Richmond is of the House of Lancaster, all the wronged members of the House of York pray for him.
The parade of Ghosts continues: Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan; then Hastings, then the two princes, then Anne, Richard’s wife; then finally Buckingham. Each delivers the same message: shame and death to Richard, divine protection and victory for Richmond.
The Ghosts vanish and Richard awakes. He is deeply disturbed by his dream and he confesses his fear to Radcliffe. The ghosts in his dream have scared him more than the army of Richmond ever could.
Meanwhile, in Richmond’s tent, he has awoken with good feelings following his dream. He gives an oration to his soldiers. He tells them that God is on their side. Richard is a tyrant and a murderer, and even his own army would sooner that Richmond wins the battle. Richmond tells them that if they fight against God’s enemy, God will guard them.
Richard cheers himself up with the knowledge that Richmond has never been formally trained in the use of arms. Norfolk enters, with the news that the enemy is already in the field. Richard orders that Stanley bring up his forces, and issues his final instructions for the battle. He gives an oration to his army in which he denounces Richmond’s army as a bunch of vagabonds and foreigners. He appeals to their patriotism.
A messenger arrives with the news that Stanley refuses to come. Richard gives the order for the execution of Stanley’s son, but Norfolk says that since the enemy is already so close, the execution can wait until after the battle.
 
Analysis
This scene clearly shows the stark conflict between good and evil that is now playing out in the civil war in England. After he has dreamed of the ghosts, Richard at last shows a smidgeon of remorse: “O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!” But Richard has never been under any illusions about himself. He has always known he is a villain and a murderer. His conscience is now pricked by fear, rather than any moral awakening. Richmond, in contrast, is presented as an avenger sent by God. He is the agent of divine providence.

Richmond announces victory. Stanley congratulates him and also says that young George Stanley is alive and safe in Leicester. Richmond promises to unite the two warring houses of York and Lancaster. In part this will be accomplished by Richmond’s marriage to Elizabeth. He looks forward to peace in the kingdom.
 
Analysis
In his final speech Richmond evokes the horror of civil war that has afflicted the kingdom for so long. He is determined to put an end to it and inaugurate a new era of peace. After the Battle of Bosworth Field Richmond was crowned Henry VII. Richmond’s speech here is a reflection of what is known as the Tudor view of history. The historians of the Tudor period that Henry VII inaugurated viewed him as a savior sent by God to rescue the nation from civil war. Building Henry VII and his successors up in this way, they also denigrated Richard III, presenting him as evil beyond redemption, a view Shakespeare followed in this play.

656,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"
	A short prologue begins the story. In it the narrator states that the story of the pearl has been worn to its essence by many retellings in the town from which it originated. As such, things in the story will be black and white, more purely evil and good than as in life. The narrator speculates that if the story is a parable then perhaps the reader will find some lesson for his or her own life.
	The novel opens just before dawn in the coastal village of La Paz on the Gulf of Mexico. Kino awakens just as the morning light is coming into the sky. The roosters, pigs and wild birds are already awake in the yard outside Kino's thatch hut. The first thing Kino sees upon opening his eyes is the light outlining the door to his hut and then he sees the hanging box where his infant son, Coyotito, sleeps. Next he looks at his wife Juana beside him on the mat. Her eyes, as they always are when Kino awakes, are already open. Most of her head is covered in a blue shawl that she uses to ward off the chill of night. She is looking at him.
	Kino hears the music of the waves upon the shore. We learn that in the past everything Kino's people did or saw became a song but that time has long since passed and no new songs have been created. Kino, however, has his personal song that is ""clear and soft"" that, if he chose to give it a name, would be called ""The Song of the Family.""
	Juana rises and, after checking to see that Coyotito is well, fans an ember from the firepit into the morning cooking fire. Kino, meanwhile, puts on his sandals and steps outside the hut to watch the dawn. A goat approaches him and a moth flies into the light of the fire. Kino now hears the song of the family coming from the stone where Juana is grinding the corn for the morning meal. The dawn comes suddenly while Kino watches ""with the detachment of God"" a group of ants in the sand. When a thin timid dog approaches Kino offers it a kind word and the dog rests contentedly near him.
	The narrator interjects that though this morning is like any other, it is perfect in its way. From the hut Kino can hear the sound of Juana singing an ancient song that forms part of the song of the family. Though the melody consists of only three notes the song is part of Kino's life and for him evokes feelings of safety and warmth. From other brush houses Kino hears other families rising with their own songs.
	Kino is young with black hair, brown skin and a thin mustache and warm but fierce eyes. Before he steps inside Kino see two inept roosters preparing for a fight in the yard and a covey of wild doves flying inland to the hills. Inside Juana has finished preparing the corn cakes and is braiding her hair. Kino eats hot corn cakes and drinks some pulque that, except for rare occasions, has always been his morning meal. Kino's sigh of satisfaction after he has eaten is all the conversation necessary for Juana and Kino to begin their day.
	The rising sun streams through the crack in the brush house and Kino and Juana's attention is suddenly drawn to a deadly scorpion descending one of the ropes supporting Coyotito's hanging box. The scorpion brings to Kino's mind the song of evil, brought by any enemy of the family, and as the scorpion draws closer to the happily gurgling infant Juana begins to recite both pagan and Christian prayers of protection. Kino slowly approaches the deadly creature but Coyotito's laughter causes the rope to shake and the scorpion falls onto the boys' shoulder. The scorpion stings Coyotito before Kino can pull it away and stamp it to death on the earth floor.
	Juana pulls the baby from the crib and immediately begins to suck the poison from the wound. The neighbors, including Kino's older brother Juan Thom�s and his wife Apolonia, come rushing at the sound of the screaming child. Everyone knows that though Juana has done her best to remove the poison there is a good chance the baby will die if enough of the venom remains. After the sickness begins the baby will suffer terribly until he dies. Juana demands that Kino bring the doctor to treat Coyotito.
	Everyone gathered at Kino's hut knows that it would be very surprising if the doctor came since he never came to the poor indian's huts. After Kino tells his wife that the doctor will not come, she responds that they must go to him. With his son's life at stake Kino agrees. Everyone follows Kino and Juana to the doctor's house. They take the path to where the stone portion of the city begins, where the walled houses hold cool inner gardens with caged birds and splashing fountains. As they proceed to the doctor's home, new people join the procession including four beggars normally posted outside the church who know everything that happens in the town. The beggars know that the doctor, who thinks of the indians as animals, will not deign to treat Kino's son.
	At the gate to the doctor's house Kino hesitates when he considers that the doctor is the descendent a people that for four hundred years had subjugated his own. Kino feels weak, afraid and angry. Kino hears the music of the enemy in his ears. Even though the rage and terror grow within him, Kino thinks to remove his hat before lifting the iron knocker on the gate. The servant who comes to the door is an indian of Kino's own race and Kino says in their common language that his child is sick and needs a healer. The servant, refusing to use the indian language, tells Kino that he will inform the doctor of the reason for their visit and then he shuts the gate.
	The doctor is languishing in his sumptuous bedchamber, drinking chocolate and, as he often does, thinking of the time that he spent in Paris as a young man when he could afford a mistress and still have the small luxuries of life. Dressed in a silk robe, the doctor drinks from a cup of china that is so small that he must use only the tip of his thumb and forefinger to lift it. He is fat and his voice has become hoarse. On the walls are various religious pictures including one in the same style depicting his deceased wife. When the servant informs the doctor of Kino's request, the doctor contemptuously asks if the indians have any money to pay for his services. The servant returns to Kino who produces several small, misshapen pearls of little value. After a time the servant returns the pearls to Kino and makes the excuse that the doctor has gone out to treat a serious case.
	The group waiting with Kino quickly dissolves because they do not want to witness his shame. Kino stands at the doctor's shut gate in silence for a time and then, after replacing his hat on his head, suddenly strikes the iron gate with his fist which causes his knuckles to begin bleeding.
	Analysis
	The novel is set in the town of La Paz, which Steinbeck visited in the course of a biological expedition with his scientist friend Ed Ricketts. The oyster beds of La Paz produced many of the pearls that had fueled the Spanish conquest of the region during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. While in La Paz, Steinbeck heard the story of a young indian who found a valuable pearl and hid it under a rock. After he was nearly killed by robbers the young indian threw the pearl back into the sea. Inspired by the tale, Steinbeck wrote his own version of the story which was initially published in Woman's Home Companion (December, 1945) as ""The Pearl of The World"". The story was first published as a book in 1947 to coincide with the release of the movie version.
	The first chapter begins with a series of descriptions -- Kino and Juana awaking, the simple but comforting disposition of their brush house, and the activities of the various animals Kino observes outside his hut. We learn that Kino is sensitive to the small details of his world and that these things all form a part of the security and comfort embodied in Kino's song of the family. When the narrator observes that ""it was a morning like other morning and yet perfect among mornings"" we can infer that Kino's life is being presented in the manner of a parable in which people and events are portrayed as sharply delineated between good and evil so that the reader can draw the narrator's intended lesson.
	The scorpion evokes the song of evil, which Kino hears whenever an enemy of the family threatens. The episode with the scorpion makes that morning different from those that preceded it and precipitates the need for a visit to the doctor's house. This in turn leads to a sharp and painful reminder to Kino that his race has always been kept poor and ignorant and that without money his son will never rise above that condition.
	Through the episode with the doctor we learn of the social stratification in the town. The prosperous descendents of the Spanish conquerors, like the doctor, still maintain the master/slave relationship with the natives whom they suppress with ignorance and poverty. Those natives who try to step outside the traditional relations are censured and, in Kino's case, publicly humiliated. Kino's futile striking of the doctor's iron gate with his fist belies his suppressed rage and bitterness.
",The Pearl
657,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"

	The second chapter begins with a description of the town's broad estuary. Steinbeck characteristically begins with the larger panorama of the lay of the land and then moves into progressively smaller details in the landscape. On the beach are the villager's canoes -- seaworthy boats that are passed down from father to son and are protected against the elements by a shell plaster made from a secret recipe known only to the fishing people. Also on the beach are dogs and pigs that search for dead fish and birds to eat. The estuary is home to numerous sea flora and fauna such as fiddler crabs, eel grass and the poisonous spotted botete fish. Due to the effects of the sun and sea mist a hazy blanket of moisture often hangs over the coast and causes mirages to appear. As a result the villagers have learned to trust their instincts more than their eyes.
	Kino and Juana with Coyotito come to the beach to put out to sea in Kino's canoe. The canoe has been handed down from Kino's grandfather and father and is his only valuable possession; moreover, without the canoe Kino and his family would be unable to fish and hunt pearls and they would starve. Kino places his diving rock and ropes in the canoe.
	Juana puts a seaweed poultice on Coyotito's arm. The narrator observes that the poultice will do more for the baby's wound than anything the doctor could do but that, in her ignorance, Juana prays that Kino might find a pearl of sufficient value to pay the doctor. Kino and Juana get in the canoe and together they paddle out to the oyster bed. The narrator states that this oyster bed has been well worked since the days when it made the King of Spain a great power. A pearl forms in an oyster when a grain of sand irritates the oyster's flesh until the oyster forms a protective shell around the irritation. The resulting pearl is thus an accident and finding one is a matter of luck.
	Using his diving stone, Kino sinks to the seafloor and carefully begins placing oysters in his basket. The Song of the Sea is in Kino's ears and interwoven with it is the Song of the Pearl That Might Be. Because of Coyotito's illness the Song of the Pearl is louder that day than on other days. Kino is young and strong and can hold is breath for more than two minutes at a time. Just before Kino reaches the point where he must return to the surface for air, however, he sees a large oyster with a reflective flash inside. Hopeful, Kino grabs the oyster and returns to the canoe. Not wanting to press their luck, Juana and Kino ignore the large oyster for a moment but Kino soon opens it with his knife and they discover a large, perfect pearl. The narrator describes it as ""the greatest pearl in the world.""
	Holding the pearl in his damaged hand, Kino begins to imagine the possibilities that have suddenly opened up to him through the wealth the pearl will bring his family. Juana calls Kino's attention to Coyotito's shoulder where the swelling has subsided and Kino's joy at his good fortune overflows in a loud cry of happiness that all the other oyster divers out on the water can hear.
	Analysis
	Steinbeck begins this chapter by first describing the larger panorama of the surrounding terrain before moving onto descriptions of progressively smaller details in the landscape. In this manner the fisherpeople are linked to the larger natural world of the estuary, which encompasses not only the lush sea life, but also the villager's canoes on the beach and the curtain of Gulf moisture that pervades the town.
	The narrator's interjections throughout this chapter are important for through them we learn details that are hidden from the characters but which affect our reading of them. For instance, the reader knows that the seaweed poultice will do more to treat Coyotito's wound than anything the doctor could have provided will. Juana, who does not know this, continues to pray for money to pay the doctor. The narrator also informs the reader that the pearl that Kino holds is ""the pearl of the world."" Because Kino does not know this he will never know what constitutes its fair market value.
	This chapter also serves to broaden the reader's understanding of Juana's role in the family. We learn, for instance, that she is an active and necessary partner in the process of gathering pearls. Thus, not only does she sustain the family by caring for Coyotito and preparing their meals but she also helps row the canoe to the oyster beds. Her relationship with Kino has a strong element of pragmatism made necessary by their poverty and the physical difficulties inherent to their daily work. This is why the narrator observes of Kino's canoe that ""it was at one property and source of food, for a man with a boat can guarantee a woman that she will eat something.""
	The narrator's description of pearls as the accidental byproducts of the irritation caused by a grain of sand in an oyster muscle, serves to establish the cause for their rarity and thus their value. It also serves to establish the degree of luck it takes to find one, much less a truly valuable one. The Song of the Pearl that Might Be consists of Kino's dreams, anxieties and prayers - all of which play a part in his submarine search. The narrator suggests that because of Coyotito's wound the need for a valuable pearl is even greater for Kino on that day than on others and the song is more audible in Kino's ears as a result. In this way the narrator connects the scorpion's sting to Kino's discovery of the pearl.
	The moment Kino sees the pearl he is changed by the possibilities it holds for his family. Just like the pearl was a kind of seed embedded in the oyster, so now are Kino's dreams of a new life embedded in his psyche because of the pearl.
",The Pearl
658,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"

	As is the nature of small towns the news of Kino's discovery spreads quickly so that by the time Kino and Juana reach shore everyone has heard about the pearl. In town, the Priest hears the news and tries to remember if he married Kino and Juana in the church. The doctor hears of the pearl while sitting with a wealthy patient and claims that he is treating Kino's son for a scorpion bite. The beggars hear of the pearl and look forward to alms from Kino. The pearl buyers, all of whom work for the same man, know that Kino will bring the pearl to one of them and though they will only make their normal salary on the transaction each dreams of taking their boss' place. Indeed, the whole town comes to transfer their dreams and desires onto to Kino's pearl and to think of it as potentially their own with only Kino standing in the way. The narrator says that the news of the pearl ""stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town"" and that the ""poison sacs of the town began to manufacture venom, and the town swelled with the pressure of it.""
	Kino and Juana, meanwhile, are ignorant of the town's malignant desires. When the indians of the village come to see the pearl and admire its perfection Juan Tomas asks Kino what he will do when now that he is a rich man. Kino, looking into the pearl, replies that he and Juana will be married in the church, they will wear fine clothes and he will own a rifle. After Kino announces that he will have his own rifle, otherwise an impossible luxury for any indian of the village, he begins to dream of even greater things and realizes that his ultimate dream is that Coyotito go to school so that his son may learn to read and write and free his people from the cycle of poverty and exploitation in which they have been trapped for generations.
	It is a noteworthy occasion and the villagers who are watching understand that whether Kino succeeds or fails to obtain riches and good fortune they will always remember the day that he found the pearl. Juana begins to make the fire for the family's evening meal but before the visitors leave their hut the Priest enters accompanied by the song of evil. The Priest has always treated the indians like children and Kino is suspicious of his motives when the Priest tries to gain Kino's favor by telling him that Kino is named after a great father of the Church. The Priest asks to see the pearl and, awed by its beauty, he asks that Kino and Juana remember to give thanks to God. Juana proudly tells the Priest that she and Kino will be married in the Church and the Priest blesses them before leaving.
	While Juana prepares the beans for their evening meal, Kino steps outside the hut but he is immediately overcome by feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. He grasps the pearl tightly in his hand. He hears the song of the family coming from the kitchen but mixed with the song is the knowledge that since he has made a plan to send Coyotito to school he will have to struggle to make that plan reach fruition. At this point, the doctor arrives and pretends that he had always intended to treat the baby. Suspicious of the doctor's motives, Kino explains that Coyotito is feeling better but the doctor insists that the poison could return in the night and that only he, the doctor, can prevent the young one's death. Juana believes the doctor and Kino, crushed by his own ignorance, reluctantly lets the doctor treat Coyotito with a pill of white powder that Kino suspects is simply more poison. Before leaving, the doctor warns Kino that the poison from the scorpion will return within the hour.
	The doctor returns to his comfortable home where he nibbles at dinner and waits for an hour to pass. Kino folds the pearl into a rag and buries it in the corner of the hut. In the estuary a school of big fish feed on small fish and the noise of the battle carries to the village. After Kino has eaten his beans Juana calls him over to look at Coyotito who is now very sick. The doctor returns and many of the village people crowd into the hut to see him do battle with the scorpion's poison. The doctor gives Coyotito some diluted ammonia solution and the baby's stomach spasms relent. Juana is thankful but Kino remains suspicious. The doctor, pretending not to know of Kino's pearl, asks how he will pay for Coyotito's treatment and after the villagers tell the doctor of the pearl the doctor offers to keep it in his safe. The doctor watches Kino's eyes which betray the pearl's hiding place when Kino refuses the doctors offer and claims that the pearl is secure. Kino tells the doctor he will pay him after he has sold the pearl in the morning. The doctor leaves.
	Kino is restless and Juana watches him dig up the pearl and rebury it under his sleeping mat. Juana asks Kino whom he fears and Kino answers that he fears everyone. Kino, Juana and Coyotito lay down together to sleep and Kino dreams of his son in school but the dream turns to a nightmare and Kino awakes to the sound of someone digging inside the house. Kino lunges at the intruder with his knife but he is struck in the head and the intruder gets away. Juana cleans Kino's bleeding wound and sensing the hatred growing in her husband she insists that the pearl is evil and should be destroyed before it destroys the family. But Kino insists that after they sell the pearl everything will be better. It is near dawn and Kino removes the pearl from its hiding place. The contentment it brings Kino spreads to Juana and they are both happy and hopeful as the sun rises.
	Analysis
	Now that Kino has brought the pearl to shore and claimed it his own the close ties that once made the small town safe and familiar to him now work to turn the people's greed against Kino. This is illustrated when he steps out into the evening and is filled with a sense of foreboding on the same spot that had that very morning filled him with contentment. He does not know specifically who his enemies are but, as he tells Juana, he fears everyone. This is a new feeling for Kino and is indicative of the manner in which the pearl brings not only the possibility of wealth but uncertainty and danger as well. The danger brought by the scorpion has been transferred to the people of the town and Steinbeck's direct comparison between the two furthers the sharp divisions between good and evil that marks the story as a parable.
	The pearl causes Kino to dream of things, like the rifle or an education, that were outside his previous station. As a result, the dreams have brought danger into his life and begun change him. After Kino finishes listing the things he will do with the wealth derived from the pearl the narrator remarks that Kino ""had never said so many words together in his life."" Juana senses the change in her husband after the attack and though she can see the potential for evil in the pearl she too is beguiled by the previously unattainable luxuries, like medical care for her son, made possible by the pearl. Juana also betrays her own dreams and biases when she proudly tells the priest that she and Kino will be married in the church. Furthermore, because she was unable to trust in the healing power of the seaweed poultice she and Kino have been duped by the doctor and become indebted to him.
	The doctor is revealed by his actions to be not only arrogant but duplicitous. The implication for the reader is that he is the force behind the night intruder. At the end of the chapter both Juana and Kino hope to exchange the pearl, which removed from nature has become an object of the town's greed and thus dangerous to them, for wealth that they believe will transform their family for the better
",The Pearl
659,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"

	It is early in the morning and the whole town of La Paz knows that this is the day that Kino will sell his pearl. The pearl buyers wait anxiously in their stalls to offer the lowest price possible for Kino's pearl. The narrator makes the point that this doesn't make them evil, it only makes them good pearl buyers because every man should strive to be his best their low bidding is a natural result of their station. The moisture in the air is especially thick and creates the mirage of a large mountain to the north of the city. The pearl divers stay on shore to witness the sale of Kino's pearl. Kino's neighbors discuss what they would do with the money and they hope that the pearl will not destroy Kino and his family by making them greedy. Because it is a special morning, Juana, Coyotito and Kino dress in their best clothes, which are simple and ragged but clean. Kino puts on his straw hat and checks to make sure it rides properly on his head - too far back or on the side would be indicative of a young, rash man and directly atop his head would be too much like an old man. Kino's hat rides slightly forward to indicate aggressiveness and certainty of purpose.
	Many people follow the family as they walk into town but only Juan Thomes walks beside Kino. The two men agree that Kino must be careful not to be cheated but since neither knows what is paid for the pearls outside La Paz they are unsure how to value the pearl. Juan Thomes tells of a time before Kino was born when the elders of the village decided to hire an agent to take their pearls directly to the capital but after two men disappeared en route they gave up on the attempt and returned to the old way of going through the pearl buyers. Kino notes that as a result, the priest at that time and to the current day annually preached a sermon warning that each man should know his station in life and not try to better himself. The sun is intense and the brother's squint their eyes at the glare. The narrator notes that squinting is the only form of defense the poor indians have ever had against the descendents of the conquerors. As the procession makes it way through town many people come out of their homes to watch it pass.
	In his office, a stout slow pearl buyer hopes that Kino will come to him. Like all the other buyers he has a black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him. While he waits and hopes, the pearl buyer practices sleight of hand with a coin in his right hand below the desk. Kino enters this man's office and receives a kind greeting. The buyer continues to practice with his coin out of sight. Playing for dramatic effect, Kino slowly brings out his deerskin pouch and rolls the great pearl onto the buyer's tray. The buyer's face betrays no reaction but under the desk his fingers stumble with the coin and it drops into his lap. All the spectators hold their breath waiting to hear the buyer's offer. The dealer declares that the pearl is a monstrosity and of little value except as an oddity. The buyer denies Kino's insistence that it is a very valuable pearl and offers him only a thousand pesos. Kino accuses the buyer of trying to cheat him. The buyer assures Kino that the pearl is not valuable and to prove his claim he has a boy bring three other buyers to the office. Because they all work for the same man, these buyers know how much has been offered and none of them make a higher bid. Kino angrily insists he has been cheated and suggests that he will take the pearl to capital himself. The buyers realize too late that they have underbid by too great a sum and the man ups his offer to 1,500 pesos before Kino angrily storms out of his office.
	Later that evening, the villagers discuss the event. Some believe the buyer and think Kino a fool not to have taken the generous offer of 1,500 pesos, others think that the buyers will never do business with Kino again and that he has destroyed himself in his brashness. Still others believe that Kino is courageous and silently hope for the best. Kino reburies the pearl and decides that though he is afraid of leaving the village he will do it and attempt to sell the pearl in the capital. Juan Thomes comes to visit and expresses his fears for Kino and observes that he has defied the village's way of life. Kino retorts that he must try to better himself and Juan Thomes gives his blessing.
	Much later in the evening Kino is sitting despondently in the hut listening to the night noises and he senses evil things lurking outside. He steps outside with his knife in hand and is immediately attacked. Juana rushes to his aid, armed with a stone, but the assailants have retreated into the shadows and Kino is lying hurt with a bloody scalp and a long, deep cut from his ear to his chin. After Juana has cleaned Kino's wounds she again beseeches him to destroy the pearl and declares it a thing of evil that will destroy them if they keep it. Kino insists that he will overcome the evil and they shall not be cheated of their good fortune. He insists that she believe him because he is a man. Juana asserts that she is afraid because a man can be killed but Kino pays her no heed. Kino asks if she is afraid to go with him, over the sea and mountains to the capital and she answers that she will go. They lie down to sleep.
	Analysis
	During the course of this chapter Kino and Juana realize the true strength of the forces arrayed against them. Though many people accompany them to the pearl buyer's office, it is more out of curiosity than for support. This is proven later when many of the villagers believe Kino has been foolish not to accept the offer of 1,500 pesos. Since none of the buyers will make what Kino feels to be a fair offer on the large pearl, Kino realizes that he will have to take the pearl to the city himself and that he will not be able to capitalize on his good luck as easily as he hoped. Furthermore, as the story Juan Thomes tells illustrates, he will now be defying the set way of doing things and may suffer as a consequence.
	The pearl buyer's habit of practicing ledgermain with a coin is an effective literary device that illustrates his skill in bargaining without recourse to outright narrative exposition. The moment when he drops the coin upon seeing the pearl indicates to the reader that he recognizes the pearl's true value. Furthermore, the fact that his face does not betray this knowledge further illustrates to the reader the pearl buyer's skill as a broker.
	After the second, more deadly attack upon Kino, Juana is convinced that the pearl will bring them nothing but destruction but Kino asserts his status as a man and insists that he can turn the pearl to fortune. That Juana agrees to accompany him to the capital illustrates her continued faith in him as well as her sense of place in the family. She has a voice but must acquiesce to her husband's decisions. Her decision to accompany him reveals that she is still most comfortable in her traditional role even though her husband is seeking to change his own role in the community.

660,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 5,"

	Kino awakens late in the night and watches Juana go the pearl's hiding place after which she slips quietly out the door. Full of anger, Kino follows her to the shore where he stops her just as she is about to throw the pearl into the sea. Kino strikes Juana brutally in the face and then kicks her in the side after she has fallen to the ground. Throughout this ordeal Juana makes no attempt to resist. Kino takes the pearl and leaves Juana lying in the surf. On his way back to the hut, however, several assailants assault Kino. Though he pierces one of his attackers with his knife the others strike him to the ground and search Kino's pockets. Meanwhile Juana washes her bruised face in the ocean. She holds no grudge against Kino because she believes men to be half-insane and half gods and she believes she could not live without one. She accepts these differences between the sexes as the way of the world. On her way home Juana finds the pearl behind a stone where Kino dropped it during the assault and then she sees Kino and another man with a fatal gash in his throat lying on the beach. Juana realizes in an instant that their old life is irrevocably gone and that they must flee or be destroyed. While she drags the dead man into the bushes Kino comes back to consciousness and begins mourning for the loss of his pearl. Juana explains quickly that she has the pearl and that because Kino has killed a man they must leave immediately. Kino agrees that they would not receive fair treatment if the case was presented in town and they decide to flee together. Juana goes to gather Coyotito and all their available food from the hut while Kino goes to get his canoe ready for the journey.
	Kino discovers that someone has knocked a hole in the bottom of his canoe - an unthinkable crime in the village. Numbed by the loss of his canoe Kino walks toward his hut but before he reaches it he sees flames leaping into the predawn sky. He encounters Juana holding Coyotito. Juana explains that she returned to the hut to find that it had been ransacked and then, as she searched the wreckage, someone had set fire to it from the outside. Kino, Juana and Coyotito slip into Juan Thomes' house before anyone sees them. Apolonia returns distraught from watching Kino's hut burn and is surprised to find them alive and in her hut. At Kino's command, however, she fetches Juan Thomes who, after hearing that Kino has killed a man, agrees to hide his brother until nightfall. Kino, Juana and Coyotito spend the day hiding in Juan Thomes' hut while Juan Thomes spreads various theories among the villagers as to where Kino might have disappeared. A fierce storm lashes the water throughout the course of the day and none of the pearl divers take their boats to sea. Under various pretences, Juan Thomes borrows food and tools, including a long knife, from his neighbors and gives them to Kino. Kino tells his brother that he and his family will go overland to the north where they believe there are cities where they can sell the pearl. Before Kino leaves he tells his brother that he cannot give up the pearl because it has become part of his soul.
	Analysis
	This chapter chronicles the further deterioration of Kino's former life as he fights with Juana, suffers the loss of his canoe and home and is again assaulted by an unknown enemy. Thus, the process begun with the discovery of the pearl and Kino's refusals to accept the buyer's offer has now come to bloodshed.
	When Kino kills his assailant the ties to his life as a member of the village are forever sundered. He is now a murderer and, though he killed in self-defense, he knows that the officials in the town will not believe his story.
	Juana's attempt to throw the pearl into the sea demonstrates the depth of her conviction that the pearl, far from a source of wealth and prosperity, is actually a thing of evil. Although she is willing to defy Kino by throwing it into the sea she is equally willing to suffer his blows and accept his will as the head of the family. Significantly, it is Juana who saves the pearl, drags the dead man into the bushes, insists that they leave immediately and retrieves Coyotito from the burning hut all of which make possible the family's continued survival. Kino's attachment to the pearl is revealed in his state of helplessness when he believes it to have been stolen and his confession to his brother that it has become one with his soul.
	Juan Thomes' willingness to shelter Kino and the pearl, even if only for a day indicates that he is Kino's one true friend left in the village. Aside from Juan Thomes, however, there is no reason to believe that anyone in La Paz, whether indian or not, will help Kino in his attempt to create real prosperity for his family. The destruction of Kino's canoe is an event which the narrator qualifies with the observations that ""the killing of a man was not so evil as the killing of a boat"" and that as a result there was ""sorrow in Kino's rage, but this last thing [destruction of the canoe] had tightened him beyond breaking."" The force of these statements leads the reader to understand that because of the destruction of Kino's canoe not only will the family's escape be more difficult but also their old way of life has been violated, never again to be made whole.

661,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 6,"

	In the night Kino and Juana with Coyotito skirt the edge of the town and take the road through the brush country towards Loreto. The night is windy and Kino is thankful because the wind will erase their tracks on the dusty path. The family walks all night and the wind dies down soon after moonrise. Tapping into the ancient ways of his people, Kino is exceptionally ""cautious and wary and dangerous"" like a hunted animal and is careful that they should walk in the wheel ruts so that in the morning the first wagon will erase their prints. At dawn they take shelter off the road behind a clump of trees and Kino uses a branch to wipe away the footprints where they left the road.
	Kino and Juana eat some of Apolonia's corncakes and then Juana falls asleep but Kino stays awake. The air is hot and dry. When Juana awakes at midday she asks him if they will be followed and Kino answers that most likely they will but he doesn't know who attacked him or who will follow. Kino reiterates his desire for a rifle once the pearl is sold. Kino looks deep into the pearl's surface and is shocked by a series of images: the man he has stabbed, Juana crawling painfully through the surf and Coyotito's face flushed with fever. The music of the pearl has become the music of evil. Kino puts the pearl away and eventually falls asleep.
	Juana stays awake and plays with Coyotito after he awakes. Kino begins to thrash in the grip of a nightmare and comes awake fully alert. He creeps to a clump of bushes by the road and sees two trackers on foot and a rifleman on a horse coming down the road. Kino knows that these men are experts and if they find the place he has swept he will have to lunge forward and try to kill the gunman first. After pausing at the spot, however, the trio continues down the road. Kino knows they will return and panic takes hold of him. He suggests to Juana that he should surrender but she reminds him that the trackers will not allow him to live once they have the pearl. Kino decides that the family should flee overland into the stony mountains were it will be more difficult to follow their trail.
	As Kino and Juana frantically make their way across the scorched arid landscape toward the granite mountains Kino hears the song of evil resounding clearly in his head. They pause at the first rise in the land and Juana and Coyotito drink the last of the water. Kino tells his wife to hide and wait for the trackers to pass and he will continue alone. Juana refuses to leave him and Kino takes strength from her resolution. Moving with more purpose now, Kino and his family zigzag toward the mountains in an effort to throw off the trackers. The ground begins to rise steeply and Kino readjusts their course toward a cleft in the mountains that looks like it might contain water. He knows that the trackers may have the same thought but without water his family will not survive so he has no choice. The narrator describes the rivulet of water in the cleft that draws all the animals in the area either to drink or to hunt the game that comes to drink - in this way the rivulet is a giver of both life and death.
	By the time Kino, Juana and Coyotito reach the water the sun has set behind the mountains. There is still enough light, however, for Kino to see that far behind them the trackers have begun to follow the family's path to the cleft. He knows they will arrive before dark. Juana and Coyotito hide in one of the shallow cave-like depressions in the cliff wall and Kino joins them after creating a diversionary path further up the cliff. Juana promises that the baby will not cry because she claims he knows of the danger.
	The trackers and the gunman eventually arrive at the spring and although they see Kino's diversionary trail they decide to settle for the night. Kino can see the tracker's cigarettes glowing in the night. Juana struggles to keep the baby silent. One of the men strikes a match and Kino can see that he is sitting up with the rifle and the other two are asleep. Kino tells Juana that he will sneak up on the man and seize the rifle but he must do so before the moon rises and sheds too much light. Although she initially resists the idea, Juana accepts it once she realizes they will be discovered in the morning.
	Kino removes his white clothes because ""his own brown skin was better protection for him"" and cautiously makes his way to just a few yards from the watchman. The song of the family is in Kino's ears as he slowly edges closer. Just as Kino is about to pounce on the man and seize the gun, the moon rises and fills the area with light. Kino hesitates a moment and in that instant he hears the sound of Coyotito crying from above. The watcher stands up, awakening one of the sleepers and they decide that the sound, which repeats, might be a coyote pup. The rifleman cocks his gun to fire at the sound and Kino jumps, but too late to prevent the man from getting off a shot. Kino stabs the rifleman in the neck and chest, fatally strikes the seated man and shoots the third with the rifle as he tries to flee up the side of the cliff. In the ensuing silence Kino hears Juana's hysterical cries and he knows that his son is dead.
	Late in the afternoon Kino and Juana return to the La Paz carrying the dead Coyotito in a blood soaked bundle. They walk into town side by side, Juana is distant and fatigued, Kino full of danger and fear. The narrator interjects that perhaps because the setting sun cast long shadows this is what ""left the deep impression on those who saw them."" The neighbors stand away as they pass and Juan Tomas raises his hand in greeting but does not speak. Kino now hears the song of the family as a battle cry as they steadily make their way to the seashore where he removes the pearl and sees in its surface an image of his dead son. He first offers the pearl to Juana to throw in the ocean. She shakes her head, indicating that Kino must do it himself. Using all his strength, Kino throws the pearl far into the ocean where it settles to the bottom and is soon covered by the sand raised by a scuttling crab.
	Analysis
	This chapter begins with the details of the family's departure from the town and the subsequent pursuit. The narrator interjects at several points to describe the manner in which Kino has become more like an animal fleeing danger. In some instances, as when he thinks to walk in the wagon ruts, this serves is to his advantage but as in the case where he and the family haphazardly run to the high place ""as nearly all animals do when they are pursued"" his animal instincts override his ability to reason. The narrator's vivid description of the spring to which they flee underscore the fact that Kino and Juana have become only the most recent example of animals driven to its water to either take sustenance or bring death. Once he is cornered Kino resolves to attack the pursuers before they can discover the family and to do this he removes his clothing and completes his transformation. The family has become little more than hunted game sheltering in a makeshift den. Significantly, Coyotito's cries are mistaken for that of a Coyote pup and Juana's primal screams are described as ""the cry of death"".
	Kino's confidence in the pearl begins to waver during the course of the pursuit. Not only does he consider surrendering after he first sees the trackers but he panics and leads the family pell-mell across the plain without regard for the easy trail they are leaving for the trackers. In both instances, Juana reassures him and reaffirms his need for preservation. Most importantly, the visions of prosperity and happiness Kino once saw in the pearl change and become dark and macabre. Finally, after Coyotito's death, Kino understands that the pearl has brought evil to his family and he is able to throw it back into the sea. Significantly he offers Juana, who was first to understand the evil of the pearl, the chance to dispose of it. True to her station, however, Juana remains steadfast as Kino's wife and returns his manhood to him by insisting that he do the deed himself.
	At story's end, his association with the pearl has irrevocably changed Kino. Whereas the song of the family was once filled with comfort and security it now sounds like a call to battle. Kino is at once full of anger for the misery that has been wrought upon his family and full of fear for the future. Of the things Kino wished for from the pearl only the rifle has come to fruition. He returns to the village holding the rifle and Juana returns holding their dead son. The juxtaposition of these images makes clear the price Kino has paid for his daring wish for a rifle.

662,The Jungle: Novel Summary,"

Summary
The Jungle begins with Marija Berczynskas overseeing and organizing a wedding ceremony in the ‘back of the yards’ in Chicago. She is Lithuanian and today her cousin, Ona Lukoszaite, has just married fellow Lithuanian Jurgis Rudkus. Ona is not quite sixteen and the readers are told her new husband is able to carry a two hundred and fifty pound quarter of beef without staggering, but he is as ‘frightened as a hunted animal’ at the wedding celebrations.
	A ‘charming informality’ is one of the characteristics of this celebration, but it is a law (transplanted from Lithuania) that no one leaves hungry. Ona’s stepmother is Aunt Elizabeth, and is referred to as Teta Elzbieta, and she and other women bring masses of food through to the guests.
	There is also music being played and this transforms the place from a saloon ‘to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky’. The violinist is Tamoszius Kuszleika and he later gets engaged to Marija. Ona is spared from crying too much (with happiness) by listening to Marija teach the musicians a song they do not know. She is described as a powerful woman who works in a canning factory handling fourteen-pound cans of beef.
	Following this, Antanas (Jurgis’s father) gives a speech. He is sixty years old, but looks eighty. He and the rest of the family have only been in the United States for six months, but this is already affecting him adversely. He works in the pickle rooms at Durham’s and this is damaging his chest.
	The music begins again and the guests dance along. The older ones wear some item of clothing that is from their homeland, but the younger people avoid doing this. These younger people have assimilated more than their elders. Some of the dancers are described, such as Alena Jasaityte. She is the ‘beauty of the evening’ and paints cans all week in a factory.
	The next event is one of the most important of the evening. This is the acziavimas, which is a three or four hour uninterrupted dance and each guest dances and leaves money for the bride and groom. The wedding costs two even three hundred dollars and this is more than a man’s wages for a year. The vesilija is a form of compact where the guests eat and drink as much as they desire, but also give the married couple money. This tradition is changing in the ‘new country’, though, and some are leaving without donating anything. Jurgis says not to worry as he will work harder to pay the bills for the wedding.
	Chapter Two begins by explaining how Jurgis is still young and optimistic, and talks lightly about work. He is also naïve and has never lived in a city before. He met Ona and her family in Lithuania and her father initially refused him permission to marry her. Jurgis went back to see her a year later to ask again only to find her father had died and the family were now impoverished. This family now consisted of Ona, Teta Elzbieta, her six children and Ona’s brother Jonas. They all believed that coming to the United States would give them freedom and more opportunities. Before they set off, and at the last moment, Marija also decides to join them.
	When they arrive in the Packingtown district in Chicago, the smell of the stockyards greets them first. They are almost penniless once they reach here after being taken advantage of in New York (as they are clearly immigrants and know no English). They all stay at Aniele Jukniene’s home as she takes in lodgers. This is already overcrowded and ‘unthinkably filthy’. There are lots of children in the area, but no school and there is a fetid odor because this part of town is built on the city dump. Despite these conditions, Ona and Jurgis look out at Packingtown in awe.
	In Chapter Three, Jokubas, a fellow Lithuanian who runs a delicatessen, shows them around the area. The cattle pens alone take up half of a square mile. He takes them to Durham’s and shows them a room where hogs are killed and the sound of their pitiful shrieks is given in detail. Their deaths are also depicted; a chain is attached to one of their legs and they are swung on this chain before being killed. The factory is described as such: ‘It was porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics.’ The narrative continues to describe the unpleasant conditions and how the inspectors are lax in checking the hogs for tuberculosis.
	Descriptions then ensue of the killing of cattle and of how nothing of the animals is wasted at Durham’s. They are thought to furnish food for thirty million people. At this early time in the narrative, Jurgis thinks the workers should be grateful to have positions with such a company and is described as guileless.
	His first work is with Durham’s rivals, Brown’s. The bosses quickly choose him when he first waits for work, because he is young and has a large stature. Because of his naivety, he is unable to see that he is lucky to have been picked.
Analysis
	Chapter One begins with the marriage of Ona and Jurgis and from Chapter Two to Chapter Seven the narrative takes the readers back to explain how the families arrived and settled in the United States, and how they saved for the wedding to take place.
	Chapter One is primarily concerned with describing how Ona and Jurgis are marrying in a traditionally Lithuanian way, and how these customs are being eroded for the worse in this new country. In the United States, the guests are less willing to pay after eating and drinking as much as possible. By beginning in such a way, the novel emphasizes immediately how the United States is having a detrimental effect on earlier traditions and how the cracks in the family’s American Dream are beginning to appear after being in this country for only a few months.
	Chapters Two and Three trace back to six months ago to when Jurgis and his father and Ona and her family came to the United States with hopes for a better future. The narrative is careful to reiterate how they innocently presumed that life would improve. This is most evident in the depiction of the central character, Jurgis, who at this early time still believes that he will be treated fairly. He is depicted as honest and willing to work, and it is also evident that he is naïve in the practices of the packers (the firms who kill the animals and produce the meat and by-products). He is in awe of companies such as Durham’s and Brown’s and is unable to see that he has only been chosen to work because of his age and build and neither of these advantages will last long with the hard work he has to undertake.

663,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 1," 
Note: All page numbers in this summary and analysis refer to the edition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the Baskervilles published in 2009 by Fall River Press.

Chapter 1: Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Summary: On a morning in 1879, John Watson, M.D., awakes to find the private detective Sherlock Holmes, with whom he shares lodgings at 221-B Baker Street, unexpectedly seated at the breakfast table. Holmes invites Watson to examine a walking stick left behind by an unmet visitor the previous night. What, Holmes wonders, can Watson deduce about the stick’s owner? Watson hazards his observations, only to have them clarified and corrected by Holmes, his deductive superior. Shortly thereafter, the walking stick’s owner, one James Mortimer, M.R.C.S. (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons), arrives. After exclaiming his delight at having the chance to observe Holmes’ skull (for he has heard of the detective’s brilliant intellect), he proceeds to tell Holmes and Watson why he is seeking the master detective’s help.
Analysis: Having grown tired of writing the adventures of the world’s first consulting detective and eager to turn his attention to more “serious” literature, Arthur Conan Doyle attempted to finish off his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, by sending him over the Reichenbach Falls as the detective grappled with his archnemesis, Professor Moriarty, in a short story entitled “The Final Problem” (December 1893). The title would, of course, prove overly optimistic! Enthusiastic readers of the Holmes tales clamored for the sleuth’s return. Conan Doyle obliged with The Hound of the Baskervilles, the third—and still hailed by many critics as the best—Sherlock Holmes novel. Conan Doyle did, however, carefully label the book as “another adventure” of Holmes of the first edition’s title page—an indication that the events in its pages took place prior to “The Final Problem,” and that the reading public should not expect any further stories. When the novel proved an instant success, however, readers pressed for more. Conan Doyle relented and engineered Holmes’ “resurrection” in 1903.
The first chapter of the present work appropriately bears Holmes’ name as its title, for it is largely a brief character sketch of the detective, introducing him or reintroducing him to the book’s audience through the eyes of his erstwhile companion, Dr. John Watson. The chapter also introduces James Mortimer, an adherent of phrenology, the now-discredited belief prevalent in Victorian science, that study of the shape of the skull indicates mental capacity and even moral character. “You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes,” Mortimer announces. “I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic [i.e., relatively long] a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital [i.e., above the eyeballs] development” (p. 18). The comment is exactly the kind of thing one would expect a self-professed (and perhaps not a little self-important) “dabbler in science” to say (p. 18). Mortimer also manages the relatively uncommon feat of being able to wound Holmes’ pride when he declares Holmes “the second highest expert in Europe” (p. 19). Mortimer ranks Holmes behind Alphonse Bertillon, “chief of criminal investigation for the Paris police from 1880” (Klinger, 397). Bertillon’s method of photographing and measuring the distinctive physical traits of criminal suspects—in profile and full-on views, the basis for the modern “mug shot”—proved highly influential in police practice worldwide, only to be superseded by the advent of fingerprinting at the turn of the 20th century. Fortunately for Mortimer, his conviction that Holmes remains the most knowledgeable “practical man of affairs” (p. 19) ensures that Holmes will give Mortimer’s case a hearing.
Mortimer demurs when Holmes addresses him as “doctor.” According to Klinger, Mortimer’s M.R.C.S. credentials are today “regarded as a specialist higher qualification in surgery, awarded to doctors who have already qualified in their profession and have elected to practice in the surgical branch of it… In Mortimer’s day [, however], the M.R.C.S. was the surgical half of the standard qualification to practice, not an advanced degree, and surgeons in fact occupied a lower position in the medical hierarchy than physicians, who diagnosed patients and prescribed medication” (pp. 388-89).
 
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
664,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 2 - 5," 
Summary: Mortimer reads to Holmes and Watson an early 18th-century manuscript that tells of how, in the time of the “Great Rebellion” [i.e., 1641-51], Hugo Baskerville, progenitor of the ancient and wealthy Baskerville line and a “wild, profane and godless man,” kidnapped the maiden daughter of a yeoman who held lands near his estate. For this crime, the document claims, Hugo Baskerville died, ravaged by “a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.” The Baskervilles thus believe a curse has been placed upon their family. Holmes dismisses the story, but is more intrigued when Mortimer reads a recent newspaper account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. A generous philanthropist and a potential candidate for Parliament in an upcoming election, Sir Charles (descendant, of course, of the notorious Hugo) had restored much of his famly’s greatness after it had fallen upon hard times by capitalizing on financial speculations in South Africa. A widower, Sir Charles lived only with his servants at Baskerville Hall, a married couple, the Barrymores, who worked as butler and housekeeper. He lived near Mortimer, who was his personal physician; as well as one Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and Mr. Stapleton, a naturalist. Sir Charles was keenly interested in the legend of the Baskerville curse, asking Mortimer several times whether he ever saw or heard strange creatures and noises, especially “the baying of a hound.” Each night before retiring to bed, Sir Charles would walk the Hall’s “famous yew alley.” He never returned from that walk on the evening of May 4; at midnight, Mr. Barrymore found his master lying dead at the alley’s end, past its gate that opens onto the moor surrounding the Hall. Sir Charles’ face wore a terrifyingly distorted expression (attributed in the autopsy to cardiac exhaustion). Barrymore noted that the appearance of Sir Charles’ footprints altered once he had passed that gate, but reported no other physical clues to the inquest. Information that the newspaper account does not include, but what Mortimer now tells Holmes, is that, three weeks prior to Sir Charles’ death, Mortimer had visited the nobleman and caught a glimpse of some large, unknown black animal—the sight of which visibly shook Sir Charles. Furthermore, in the yew-alley, Mortimer saw the “fresh and clear” footprints of a gigantic hound.
Analysis: Conan Doyle effectively creates a mood of suspense and fear in this chapter: even though it is set in Holmes and Watson’s Baker Street apartment, it is filled with evocative, atmospheric descriptions of Baskerville Hall, the site of strange—and, perhaps, supernatural—occurrences. The novel is a work of mystery, not horror; nevertheless, this chapter contains elements that might equally be at home in a Gothic tale of terror: the ancient family manor, recently refurbished but still bearing marks of “evil days” gone by (p. 26); a secret, shameful family history in the tale of Hugo Baskerville and his fellow drunken revelers who are struck by terror on the moonlit moors, only to be pursued by evil and misfortune until their (sometimes untimely) deaths; and, of course, our first description of the titular hound, with “its blazing eyes and dripping jaws” (p. 24)—“such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels” (p. 23). The circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death, as well, laid out in careful detail by Conan Doyle as he sets the stage for the detective tale to follow, inspire feelings of dread, which culminate in Mortimer’s nearly whispered revelation that he has seen “the footprints of a gigantic hound” (p. 30). (Indeed, we will read at the beginning of the next chapter that Mortimer’s words gave Watson, a man of science, “a shudder,” p. 31!) Some critics have pointed out that, in real life, one cannot tell the breed of dog merely from its pawprints; but, as Baker Street Journal editor Edgar W. Smith noted, Mortimer’s frequently quoted, chapter-concluding line is all about maximum artistic impact: “I remember one of my sons, when he was very young, going about the house muttering: ‘Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic cocker-spaniel!’ That, I am sure, would not have had quite the same dramatic effect…” (Klinger, p. 414).
 
Chapter 3: The Problem
Summary: Holmes questions Mortimer and establishes that the dog he saw was not a sheep dog; that the wicket-gate is the only exit from the yew-alley that leads to the moor, and that Sir Charles had apparently stood there for some time; that the hound’s footprints were clearly on the path and not on the surrounding grass; and that three people report having seen the hound prior to Sir Charles’ death, but none have reported seeing it since. For all this attention to the details of the night in question, however, Mortimer reveals that he does not wish Holmes to investigate Sir Charles’ death. Rather, he has approached the detective for advice about what to do when Sir Charles’ only heir, one Henry Baskerville, returns from abroad. (The only other kinsman was one Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’ youngest brother and “the black sheep of the family,” who is reported to have died in Central America in 1876.) Mortimer wants the charitable work begun by Sir Charles to continue, and knows that, to that end, Baskerville Hall must have a squire; but he does not want Sir Henry to go to Baskerville Hall for fear of the curse upon the family. Holmes is, of course, deeply skeptical of all such supernatural beliefs; he recommends that Mortimer simply meet Sir Henry at Waterloo Station upon his arrival, yet not tell him anything of the current situation. Mortimer departs, as does Watson, who knows that his friend needs isolation in which to reflect upon the facts of the case. When Watson returns several hours later, he finds Holmes poring over a topographical map of the Baskerville estate and the surrounding lands. Holmes has also concluded that, contrary to Sir Charles’ usual routine, the squire of Baskerville Hall was waiting at the wicket-gate; and that the shifting shape of Sir Charles’ footprints as reported by Mortimer must be due to the fact that Sir Charles began running away from something in terror.
Analysis: Conan Doyle created one of the most famous rationalists in world literature, yet he himself remained very open to “supernatural explanation[s]” of worldly phenomena (p. 38). The author was a committed Spiritualist (including his adherence to the belief that the dead could communicate with the living), and is also remembered as one of the more famous defenders of the “Cottingley fairies,” a 1917 incident in which two young girls purported to have taken photographs of fairies in their garden (later proved to be cardboard cutouts). Sherlock Holmes would never for a moment have been taken in by such a ruse, as this chapter makes plain. “We are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses,” he tells Watson, “before falling back upon” supernatural ones (p. 38). Although Holmes demonstrates some respect for Mortimer—when the physician notes the two separate droppings of ash from Sir Charles’ cigar, Holmes proclaims him to be “a colleague, Watson, after our own heart” (p. 33)—he clearly rejects Mortimer’s eager embrace of the paranormal and the otherworldly. As Holmes correctly points out, such an attitude does not quite seem to befit “a trained man of science” (p. 34). Holmes points out inconsistencies in supernaturalism’s own internal logic: for example, he seeks to disarm Mortimer’s fear for Sir Henry’s fate were the scion of the family to return to the state by pointing out that “surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire” (p. 35). And whereas Mortimer gives easy credence to reports of “several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature” (p. 33), Holmes makes it his life’s work to achieve such reconciliations. In maxim-like fashion, Holmes declares to Watson (who is very often the recipient of such lessons in the Holmes stories), “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes” (p. 37). Observation and logic, not a resort to supernatural hypotheses, prove critical to Holmes’ success.
The detective concerns himself with the real world: “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?” he asks (p. 38). As one who has apprehended many criminals prior to this case, Holmes knows the answer must be affirmative!
Chapter 4: Sir Henry Baskerville
Summary: At ten the next morning, Mortimer arrives at Baker Street with Sir Henry Baskerville, who has already experienced a singular occurrence. Although no one should have known that he had stayed the night at the Northumberland Hotel, he received a letter addressed to him there: a single sheet of paper containing a message composed of words—all but the last one—clipped from a printed source and affixed to the sheet: “As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.” To everyone’s astonishment, Holmes immediately identifies the source of the clippings as the lead article from the previous day’s Times. (The word “moor” had to be supplied by hand in ink because it is a less common word.) Holmes further deduces (from the ink splotches, indicative, he says, of a hotel fountain pen) that the sender of the letter assembled it in a hotel near Charing Cross (from the envelope’s postmark). Whether the letter is warning or threat, no one seems sure. Sir Henry is still unaware of the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death; Mortimer gives him the same account he gave Holmes and Watson the previous day. Sir Henry reports that he bought a new pair of boots upon his arrival in London, and, never having worn them, left them outside his hotel room in order to be varnished overnight. That morning, he discovered one of the boots, and one only, had been stolen. Mortimer and Sir Henry begin walking back to the hotel; allowing them a lead of two hundred yards, Holmes and Watson follow them, unbeknownst to the baronet and the physician. Holmes spies a bearded man in a hansom cab also shadowing the pair; unfortunately, the bearded man notices Holmes and Watson in return, and urges his driver to move quickly on, so that Holmes and Watson cannot catch up. They lose the trail of the hansom cab; they lose track of Mortimer and Sir Henry; but Holmes did note the number of the cab (No. 2704). He plans to send a telegram to ascertain the identity of the driver of that cab; meanwhile, he hires a teenager named Cartwright to inspect the garbage from the 23 hotels in the Charing Cross area, looking for a cut-up front page of yesterday’s Times. This evidence, Holmes reasons, will lead them to the person who sent Sir Henry his mysterious letter.
Analysis: As a character, Sir Henry is not yet well-developed in this chapter; however, that is due to the fact that he serves mainly as a way for Conan Doyle to introduce deeper levels of mystery into the tale (the enigmatic letter and the stolen boot). We do, however, read that Sir Henry has “the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air”—indicative, as he says, of having spent most of his life in the United States and Canada (p. 46)—but also “the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman” (p. 41). Sir Henry is both rugged and genteel, civilized and of the frontier. He also intends to continue the good works of his uncle: he intends to fully embrace his role as “squire” (p. 47) of Baskerville Hall. “There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer” (p. 48). This resolve speaks to Sir Henry’s “fiery temper,” a family trait (p. 48). Therefore, although we do not yet know much about him, he emerges from this chapter as a sympathetic character in whose fate readers will be interested.
This chapter also, of course, serves to further dazzle Conan Doyle’s readers with Holmes’ logical prowess. His knowledge of various typefaces (although he allows that, as a younger man, he “confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News,” p. 44—surely a fully self-aware statement of false humility, since most ordinary people would not even begin to know how to distinguish the papers’ typography), his immediate recall of the number of hotels in the Charing Cross area, his identification of the kind of scissors used by the letter’s compositor, his knowledge of the traits of hotel fountain pens—all these instances further establish Holmes (as though he needed any such establishment in the minds of Conan Doyles’ reading audience!) as master of his “special hobby” of detection (p. 44). We also learn, however, that Holmes does not rely solely on his own efforts. His employment of young Cartwright hearkens back to his use of “the Baker Street Irregulars”—a ragamuffin group of street urchins, who perform various tasks and find out information for Holmes for a shilling reward—in the Conan Doyle’s two previous Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four.
Chapter 5: Three Broken Threads
Summary: At the Northumberland Hotel, Holmes and Watson find Sir Henry distraught because an old black boot was returned to him in place of the new brown one that was stolen. At lunch, Sir Henry announces his intention to go to Baskerville Hall at the week’s end, a decision Holmes affirms. When Sir Henry asks Holmes to accompany him, Holmes regrets that he cannot, but suggests that Watson go in his stead. Holmes tells Sir Henry and Mortimer that they were followed yesterday; he learns that Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, has a full, dark beard, as did Sir Henry and Mortimer’s unknown follower. Barrymore and his wife were left £500 each in Sir Charles’ will. Other beneficiaries include £1000 to Mortimer and numerous other individuals and charities. Sir Henry is inheriting £740,000. In all, Sir Charles’ estate is valued “close on to a million.” Holmes learns that, had Sir Henry been unable to inherit the estate, it would have passed to one James Desmond, an elderly clergyman. As the group rises from lunch, Sir Henry spies his missing new brown boot under a cabinet in a corner of the dining room, even though all previous searches had not located it.
Upon returning to Baker Street, Holmes receives telegrams informing him that Barrymore the butler is at Baskerville Hall, and that Cartwright was unable to locate the cut-up front page of the previous day’s Times. Also, he and Watson receive a visit from John Clayton, the driver of hansom cab no. 2704. Clayton tells them that his fare, so interested in trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer, was a detective by the name of Sherlock Holmes! Holmes is amused at having been bested by their unknown opponent, but warns Watson that the case is rapidly developing into “an ugly dangerous business.”
Analysis: The chapter title is metaphorical, of course: when the interview with Clayton fails to yield the name of his fare, Holmes laments, “Snap goes our third thread [of investigation], and we end where we began” (p. 63). (The other two threads were the location of Barrymore—his presence at Baskerville Hall would seem to argue against his being the bearded man who followed Sir Henry and Mortimer—and Cartwright’s failure to find the mutilated newspaper.) Notice, however, how Holmes often takes setbacks in stride. He greets Clayton’s revelation that his fare was “Sherlock Holmes,” for instance, with “a hearty laugh,” proclaiming (using a metaphor from the sport of fencing), “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” (p. 61). (Klinger notes that Holmes is here alluding to Hamlet, Act V, Scene ii: “Is this further evidence of Holmes’ acting career or merely of his knowledge of literature?”, p. 457.) Holmes is secure enough in his own intellectual ability to recognize when others have bested him (a trait we see in other Holmes stories; for example, his respectful appellation of Irene Adler as “The Woman” in “A Scandal in Bohemia”)—even if, in the end, he has every reason to believe he will gain the upper hand (as he does in this case—else he would not have been able to display what Watson describes as that “remarkable” ability of “detaching his mind at will” in order to enjoy the art exhibition prior to the trip to the Northumberland Hotel, p. 53). In fact, Holmes relishes matching wits with opponents who can challenge him; in several Holmes stories, we see that he cares little for common, unimaginative criminals. No: Holmes is far happier, far more intellectually stimulated, when he is placed in a contest with, as he says here, “a foeman who is worthy of our steel” (p. 63—and one almost senses that the use of the plural pronoun refers not to himself and Watson, but the “royal we”!)
For all that it reinforces Holmes’ high opinion of himself, however, this chapter also shows us the true friendship and regard in which he holds his confidante and chronicler, Dr. Watson. When he suggests that Sir Henry take “a trusted man” with him to Baskerville Hall (albeit after begging off being that man himself because of a highly important and delicate case in which he is already involved—an explanation of which readers should make a mental note), he commends Watson to Sir Henry: “there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say that more confidently than I” (p. 58). The detective may not always acknowledge it openly, but he knows Watson is much more than (as he said in Chapter 1) “a conductor of [Holmes’ own] light.” The good doctor is a man of practical common sense and also capable of direct action; as Watson himself says, “The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me…” (p. 59). The recommendation that Watson accompany Sir Henry also marks a transition to the next portion of the narrative, in which Watson will be much more directly involved in the action.
 
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
665,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 6 - 10," 
Summary: Holmes urges Watson to report any even possibly relevant fact about the situation at the Baskerville estate back to him. After eliminating the elderly clergyman Desmond, Holmes enumerates those who live at and around Baskerville Hall whom he does consider suspects in Sir Charles’ death: the Barrymores, Dr. Mortimer and his wife, the naturalist Stapleton and his sister, Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and a few other neighbors.” Watson takes a revolver with him. At the platform, Mortimer avers that he and Sir Henry have not been followed again. He says he and the baronet remained together during the previous two days, save for the time Mortimer spent at the Museum of the College of Surgeons and Sir Henry spent in a park (probably Hyde Park, according to Klinger, 462). Sir Henry reports that he never got his other boot back. Holmes urges Sir Henry not to travel the moors alone or at night. The train arrives in Devonshire after only a few hours’ time, and Sir Henry is quite moved by the impressive and imposing sight of Baskerville Hall and its lands, which he has never visited. The company learns that a convict has escaped from the nearby prison at Princetown; armed soldiers keep watch, but the fugitive—the notorious (and possibly insane) Notting Hill murderer, named Selden—has not yet been spotted. Barrymore the butler greets Sir Henry and the others at the Hall, but does announce that he and his wife plan to leave once the Hall’s new master is settled; he says they were greatly devoted to Sir Charles, and cannot stay on comfortably as a result of his death. As Watson tries to sleep that night, he hears the muffled sobbing of a sorrowful woman.
Analysis: This chapter largely serves an atmospheric purpose, further establishing the ominous tone and sense of foreboding that hang over Baskerville Hall and its ill-fated residents as we see the familial estate for the first time, through the eyes of our narrator, Dr. Watson. “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” says Sir Henry, in a masterful understatement (p. 72). Indeed, Baskerville Hall and its environs seem to be, in the topography of Conan Doyle’s novel, the one blemish on an otherwise pleasant stretch of the British countryside. “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his own country,” remarks Watson (p. 66)—but surely very few, and certainly none who did not hail from the Baskerville line, would swear by this estate! We see it first in “fading light” (p. 70)—a symbolic description, also, of the faded glory of the Baskerville line. Watson’s description of the Hall and its setting—evocative of similar literary houses in decay such as Poe’s House of Usher—not only sets a tone of dread and danger, therefore, but also establishes Baskerville Hall as a liminal location—a “thin place” (as ancient Celts termed them), in “limbo” between two worlds or two realities.
In fantasy, the presence of liminal beings in liminal locations often serves to signal that a protagonist will learn a lesson that could not be taught otherwise. In his book How to Read Literature Like a Professor (Quill, 2003), Thomas C. Foster argues that every trip in a work of fiction is really a quest, and that “the real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge” (Foster, p. 3). It is not immediately clear that such is the case in Conan Doyle’s novel, although the hypothesis is not without merit. One might argue, perhaps, that Sir Henry is in a sense “coming of age” as he comes into his own as squire of Baskerville Hall (e.g., “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had never seen the Hall,” p. 66), and is thus recapitulating in some small sense “the hero’s quest.” Watson certainly provides a heroic description of the baronet in this chapter: “as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men” (p. 67; see also his comment in the next chapter that it is Sir Henry’s way to live in “the place of danger,” p. 86). And the good doctor himself might be considered a potential candidate for liminal instruction, although Conan Doyle’s intent with the character seems to have been never much more than to provide an accessible narrator with whom readers could identify as, together, narrator and audience marvel at the deductive prowess of Sherlock Holmes! (It is no small testament to Conan Doyle’s skill, therefore, that The Hound of the Baskervilles—“another adventure of Sherlock Holmes” in which Holmes himself is absent for such a long stretch of the narrative—continually ranks among readers’ favorites in the Sherlockian “canon.”)
 
Thomas Foster also rhetorically asks, “What… does geography mean to a work of literature? Would everything be too much?... Geography in literature can… be revelatory of virtually any element in the work” (Foster, p. 164, 166). This thesis holds true for The Hound of the Baskervilles. The physical setting of Baskerville Hall does more than establish a mood or tone; it also establishes thematic material. Readers can clearly see this dynamic at work as Watson writes of Selden, the escaped murderer who is believed to be running loose among the moors: “Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out” (p. 68). To judge from Watson’s words, Selden sounds the equal of such famous, outcast literary monsters as Grendel and Frankenstein’s Creature!
There may yet be hope for the Baskerville house, both the estate and the lineage: Facing the black and forbidding manor house “is a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s South African gold” (p. 69). The half-completed new building reperesents all the good that Sir Charles was doing with his wealth, and the good works that Sir Henry has announced his intention to continue. The new and the old are almost in conflict at Baskerville Hall—e.g., the “twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes” are athwart “more modern wings of black granite” (p. 70); or the contrast between the old dining hall, complete with portraits of a “dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency” and the “modern billiard-room” (p. 72)—all further evidence of the place’s liminal nature. When Sir Henry sees the house, despite the solemn atmosphere, “his dark face [lights] up with a boyish enthusiasm” as he contemplates plans for its improvement (p. 71). (Note how he proposes to bring electricity—British inventor Joseph Swan received a patent for a lightbulb in 1878, a year before Thomas Alva Edison received his patent in America—to the hall “inside of six months,” p. 69—his role, both literally and figuratively, is that of a bringer of light into darkness.) The fact that all is not lost for the Baskervilles lends a sense of urgency to the solution of the mystery. Much is at stake, not only for Sir Henry, but for the disordered, chaotic society around him.
Chapter 7: The Stapletons of Merripit House
Summary: In the morning, Watson learns that the weeping woman he heard the previous night was Mrs. Barrymore, even though her husband denied the fact. He also learns that the telegram Holmes sent from London to Mr. Barrymore was not delivered directly into the butler’s hands, meaning that Barrymore could have been in the city, after all, trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer. While Sir Henry sorts through necessary paperwork, Watson goes walking upon the moor, where he meets the naturalist Jack Stapleton, who lives nearby at Merripit House in the hamlet of Grimpen. His house is an old residence now refurbished for modern living. Mortimer is hunting butterflies, and tells Watson several curious details about the moor, including the fact that the apparently lush and fertile mire around Grimpen is actually a treacherous place, where one “false step… means death to man or beast.” Indeed, the two men watch a pony sucked down into the mire as it attempts to gallop through. The mire has encroached upon the hills over the years, essentially transforming them into highly inaccessible islands; Mortimer, however, goes to the islands to seek his rare specimens. As he is pursuing an especially unusual butterfly, his sister, Beryl Stapleton, approaches Watson and, thinking the doctor is Sir Henry, urges him to return to London as soon as possible. Jack returns and introduces the two; later, Beryl meets Watson on the road back to Baskerville Hall, asking him to forget her warning, which Watson is understandably loathe to do. Beryl tells Watson that she believes in the curse of the Hound, and cannot understand why Sir Henry wishes to place himself in danger. Watson cannot ascertain from Beryl why she could not tell him this in her brother’s hearing; she refuses to elaborate, and returns to Merripit House quickly, before she can be missed.
Analysis: Conan Doyle introduces two new characters in this chapter, Jack and Beryl Stapleton. Mentioned earlier (see Ch. 2, p. 29), Jack Stapleton is a naturalist, as were many well-educated men of means in the Victorian era: not a formally trained scientist as we understand that distinction today, but one well versed in such natural sciences as botany and zoology. Jack was formerly a teacher, but a “serious epidemic” claimed the lives of three boys in his school, causing it to close and “irretrievably swallow[ing] up” much of Jack’s investment in the institution (p. 84). He relates this history in a remarkably casual way; Conan Doyle may be attempting to plant a seed of doubt in readers’ minds, as any good mystery writer does. Part of the author’s task is to cast the gloom of suspicion upon as many characters as possible, heightening suspense and keeping readers guessing about the solution of the mystery. (Note also how, in this chapter, the butler Barrymore engages in suspicious behavior, denying that his wife was crying the night before, even though Watson sees for himself that she was. This fact causes Watson to reflect upon Barrymore’s reliability: “It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man’s death,” p. 75).
Jack Stapleton makes repeated references to the unusual nature of the location of Baskerville Hall. He expresses surprise that Sir Henry would “bury himself in a place of this kind” (p. 77)—a striking choice of language, given that Sir Charles has only recently been literally buried! He calls the moor a “queer” and “uncanny place altogether” (p. 81), and states—in a knowing way, which may also raise readers’ suspicions—that Watson “will find some very singular points” about it (p. 82). Yet Jack also seems to enjoy the locale in a way that his sister clearly does not. Even though the moor is “hard to know” (p. 79), Jack knows his way to and from the islands in “the great Grimpen Mire… a bad place” (p. 80). He actively dissuades Watson (who, in several of the Sherlock Holmes stories, establishes himself also as active and witty) from seeking to reach the islands himself—perhaps another point of suspicion? Why does Jack spend so much time upon the moor—solely to add to his impressive butterfly collection?  And why does he react so casually to the drowning of the pony in the mire? As Watson points out, the sight of the horse’s death “turned [him] cold with horror, but [Jack’s] nerves seemed to be stronger” (p. 80). Jack’s reaction to the dead pony is not, in fact, unlike his reaction to his three dead students: author Frederick Ryan-Brown questions how Jack could possibly have felt “simultaneously… uninterested and privileged, and suggests that, based on how the reader eventually comes to understand the character, Stapleton’s first thought is far truer than the second” (Klinger, 485). Certainly, readers may conclude there is more to Jack than meets the eye—as, indeed, is the case with the moor itself. We learn in this chapter that the moor and the Grimpen mire are places where appearances can be deceiving. The mire, for instance, looks to Watson like “a rare place for a gallop” (p. 79), but it is actually treacherous ground. What appear to be “sheep-pens” (p. 81) are actually the huts of Neolithic ancestors (another example of the moor’s liminality, “mired,” as it were, in between the past and the present; according to Klinger, “Baedeker’s Great Britain (1894) characterizes the moors as abounding in menhirs, stone circles, and ‘other relics of the ancient Brtions,” p. 482).
 
Altogether, the chapter compounds the mystery surrounding Baskerville Hall. Readers may feel as disoriented as Watson: “Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track” (p. 86). To his credit, however, Watson does not shrink from the mystery in the way that Sir Henry seems to. By the light of the morning, the baronet is able to dismiss his misgivings about Baskerville Hall as the effect of being “tired with [the] journey and chilled by [the] drive,” and he dismisses the sound of Mrs. Barrymore’s weeping as a dream; Watson, in contrast, steadfastly maintains, “I heard it distinctly” (p. 74). The good doctor may be confused at the moment, but readers nevertheless have reason to believe that Sherlock Holmes’ confidence in him as his proxy has been well-placed.
Chapter 8: First Report of Dr. Watson
Summary: Watson writes a letter to Holmes, reporting that Selden, the escaped convict, is believed to have left the area entirely. He also reports that Sir Henry has begun to express an attraction to Miss Beryl Stapleton—a development that appears to cause her brother, Jack, some consternation. Watson has also now seen the yew alley, the scene of Sir Charles’ death, for himself; and has met Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall, an elderly man who spends most of his time filing lawsuits and surveying the moor with a telescope. Sir Henry has asked Barrymore about Holmes’ test telegram from London: Barrymore confirms that the message was not delivered into his hands; he claims his wife—whom Watson thinks aloof and puritanical—brought it to him and relayed his answer. Watson concludes his letter by reporting that, around two o’clock that morning, he saw Barrymore walking stealthily through the corridors and peering out the window onto the moor, impatiently.
Analysis: This chapter is presented as a letter from Watson to Holmes. There is some irony in the fact that much of Watson’s letter is concerned with matters of the heart, as he tells Holmes of Sir Henry’s “considerable interest in our fair neighbour,” Miss Stapleton (p. 90). Readers may wonder whether Holmes would have observed this development as keenly as Watson does: the good doctor notes, “From the first moment that [Sir Henry] saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual” (p. 91). Watson is also able to discern Jack Stapleton’s disapproval of the baronet’s romantic attentions to his sister, as well as to surmise an explanation: “He is much attached to her… and would lead a lonely life without her” (p. 91). Although readers cannot know whether Holmes would or would not have ascertained these affairs of the heart for himself, they can have no doubt that, know that he knows of them, he will take them into consideration. Holmes’ confidence in sending Watson to Baskerville Hall in his stead is thus further justified. The doctor is developing his own “theories” about the “secret business going on in this house of gloom” (pp. 96, 95); and, indeed, has devised a plan of action in cooperation with Sir Henry to test them; but he, as well as the readers, know that the ultimate solution must await Holmes’ arrival.
Only briefly introduced in this chapter, Frankland nevertheless makes a striking impression, thanks to Watson’s economical but well-chosen words of description: “he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting” (p. 92). How true such motivation seems to be behind so much litigious action, not only in Victorian Britain but also in modern America! Frankland is in Watson’s view a comic character, for his continued engagement in lawsuits seems a reckless waste of his fortune and results in equal amounts praise and disapprobation for him: Frankland “applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit” (p. 93). (According to Klinger, “there was no village of Fernworthy, [but] there was a substantial farming district of that name” in Dartmoor, p. 494.) Readers may also infer that Frankland will prove important for his ongoing observation of the moor, looking for the escaped convict Selden—Watson’s theory that the criminal must be far away, due to lack of food on the moor, seems overly optimistic (and Conan Doyle would not be making so much of the fact were it not to figure into the story at some future point, in some way). Readers will also note that Frankland is one of two people we see watching the moor: the other, of course, is Barrymore, whom Watson secretly spies “crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass… as he stared out into the blackness of the moor… watching intently” (p. 95). It is a suitably Gothic image for this tale of suspense and suggested supernatural mystery—as well as, of course, a potential clue in its ultimate resolution.
Chapter 9: Second Report of Dr. Watson: The Light upon the Moor
Summary: Watson and Sir Henry plan to follow Barrymore on his nocturnal walk that evening, in order to discovery why he stands at the particular window he does, the window “which commands the nearest outlook upon the moor.” In the meantime, Sir Henry asks Watson to leave him alone as he goes down to the moor to visit Miss Stapleton. Watson, torn between his desire to respect his new friend’s privacy and his promise to Holmes to not leave the baronet alone, follows from a distance. Thus he sees Sir Henry and Beryl Stapleton’s animated conversation (which he cannot hear) interrupted by Jack Stapleton, brandishing his butterfly net. After more apparently heated conversation, brother and sister leave Sir Henry. Watson reveals himself to the baronet, who tells him that he was in the midst of proposing marriage to Miss Stapleton. Her brother objected, expressing anger with both his sister and Sir Henry. The baronet cannot understand why Beryl’s brother should possibly object to the match. That afternoon, however, Jack Stapleton visits the Hall, explaining that he is simply upset at the thought of losing his sister to marriage after so many years of togetherness. He asks Sir Henry to wait three months before pursuing any more talk of marriage, in order to give him time to acclimate to the idea. Sir Henry agrees.
For the next two nights, he and Watson carry out their plan of tracking Barrymore to the window. On the first night, they hear no sound of the butler; on the second, however, they do follow him to the window. They watch as Barrymore holds a candle to it, and see a corresponding, answering light on the moor. When they confront Barrymore, they learn from him and his wife that Eliza Barrymore’s younger brother is none other than the escaped convict, Selden. They had taken him in and cared for him prior to Sir Henry’s arrival at Baskerville Hall; once Sir Henry returned, they arranged to signal him privately, every other night, to see if he needed food and provisions. If he answered their signal, they would set out goods for him. Watson and Sir Henry resolve to capture Selden and turn him in to the authorities. When they reach the light on the moor, however—it is a candle so set in the cleft of a tor (an outcropping of rock formed by weathering, usually located at or near a hill’s summit) that it can only be seen on a direct line-of-sight from the window at which Barrymore stood—they are not able to catch Selden, although they see (presumably) the criminal’s “evil yellow face… all seamed and scored with vile passions.” Selden outruns the two men. They hear a terrible crying sound, the sound Watson has heard once previously and which residents of the moor believe to be the baying of the Baskerville Hound; furthermore, Watson alone catches a glimpse of a man atop the tor a taller man than Selden, standing silent and still. Before Watson can point this mysterious figure out to Sir Henry, the stranger is gone. Watson again writes to Holmes, relating all these events to him and urging him to come quickly to Baskerville Hall.
Analysis: As he concludes his second epistle to Holmes, Watson confidently asserts, “We are certainly making some progress” (p. 115). Certainly, several mysteries at Baskerville Hall seem to have been explained. But readers of the detective genre in general and of Sherlock Holmes stories in particular may well intuit that Watson’s confidence in his own investigative abilities may yet prove premature. The good doctor asks Holmes to “congratulate” him, “and tell me that I have not disappointed you as agent” (p. 105). And Holmes may not “regret” sending Watson (p. 105)—yet Watson may discover, as he did in the first chapter, that Holmes values Watson for reasons other than those Watson would presume! It is unlikely, for example, that the detective will be content with Jack Stapleton’s explanation of his behavior toward Sir Henry and his sister, even though Watson and Sir Henry accept this explanation straightaway. Even so, Watson’s work will prove valuable in providing Holmes with “all the facts”—as the doctor himself realizes: he “feel[s] that it is best” that Holmes “select for [him]self those [facts] which will be of most service” (p. 115). Sir Henry’s question regarding his and Watson’s outing in pursuit of Selden—“I say, Watson… what would Holmes say to this?” (p. 111)—in some respect applies to Watson’s entire account of the matter. What would Holmes say? Readers can expect that he will see the same facts as Watson, as well as many others, and yet arrive at different and more fully correct conclusions.
Jack Stapleton’s account of his emotional state, as well as his request that Sir Henry wait three months before officially courting Beryl, rings a bit hollow (not least because, sad to say, it is an explanation Watson had already constructed as a possibility, in his first letter to Holmes-cf. p. 91). More convincing—again, in no small part because it comes as a surprise, and since they have no obvious incentive to manufacture such a tale—is the Barrymores’ revelation that Eliza is Selden’s sister. Conan Doyle has thus established two unusual brother-sister relationships in the novel: Jack and Beryl Stapleton, and John and Eliza Barrymore. These relationships, each one conflicted in some way—Jack’s displeasure at Sir Henry’s attentions to Beryl; the strain John and Eliza bear and the risk they run in supporting their brother who “dragged [their family] name in the dirt” (p. 109)—reinforce the novel’s preoccupation with the influence of family and the inescapable power of lineage, which is, after all, what Sir Henry is reckoning with, as well. The baronet, Watson reports, is sparing no expense to refurbish the Hall and thus “restore the grandeur of his family” (p. 99). Restoring family fortunes—both literal and metaphorical—are emerging as one of the novel’s major thematic concerns.
Regarding Selden’s physical appearance as described by Watson, Klinger notes, “Watson seems… to embrace the popular conception… that criminals could be identified by certain physical characteristics” (p. 515). The irony is that this prevailing medical-physiological theory of the day is no more sound than Mortimer’s devotion to phrenology—or, indeed, than the commoners’ superstitious belief in the Baskervilles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
 
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
 
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
666,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 11 - 15," 
Summary: Watson questions Laura Lyons, who reluctantly tells him that she wrote to Sir Charles on the day of his death. Persecuted by her husband and her father (Frankland), she was seeking further assistance toward her financial independence (she has also been receiving help from Stapleton). Mrs. Lyons insists, however, that she never went to Baskerville Hall that day; she claims to have received help from elsewhere, and planned to commence divorce proceedings against her husband, a claim Watson intends to verify—although he must admit to himself that her story hangs together. He still intuits, however, that she may be hiding some truth from him. The doctor then turns his attention to seeking the man he saw on the Black Tor; he receives unexpected help from Frankland, who claims to have seen the messenger boy who takes Selden his food. Watson knows the truth: the boy is supplying food to the unknown man upon the moor, and not to Selden (who has been supplied by the Barrymores). Frankland shows Watson the boy through his telescope, as he is delivering one of his bundles. Watson goes to the same old stone hut as the boy. It is empty at the moment but shows signs of being recently inhabited, chief among them a surprising note: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.” Watson fears that this stranger is pursuing him rather than Sir Henry until the hut’s inhabitant returns, revealing himself to be none other than Sherlock Holmes.
Analysis: Poor Dr. Watson—his efforts are admirable, but he will never be able to outshine Holmes! Which is, of course, only as it should be: having Watson as an affable foil to the often abrasive but indisputably brilliant Holmes is the chief way in which Conan Doyle characterizes his most famous character. We see Holmes through Watson’s admiring eyes, and thus come to admire him ourselves. Thus we can forgive the master detective his dramatic entrance, in which he has some fun at Watson’s expense. Holmes’ arrival even has a slight air of justice about it, for Watson has earlier speculated, “It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run [the man on the tor] to earth where my master had failed” (p. 132). Were Watson to best Holmes, things would be even more out of joint than they already are! Conan Doyle’s use of “master” language may seem odd, smacking as it does of Victorian British class structure; it implies that Holmes and Watson are not equals. While they are equal in a socio-economic sense (they do, after all, share the flat at Baker Street), they are not equal in their deductive ability. And so we also likely feel some of Watson’s relief that Holmes has, at last, arrived—for Watson has been effectively stymied in his own detecting work: “Once again,” he laments after his interview with Laura Lyons, “I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission” (p. 131). For all these reasons, then, readers may fairly anticipate that Holmes’ arrival on the scene marks the beginning of a “re-ordering” of the disordered social world of the novel.
The marital status of Laura Lyons reflects some of the social disorder with which Victorian society was grappling. As Klinger points out, “Victorian society had little regard for divorced (or separated) women” (p. 538), and so both Watson’s and the reader’s sympathies for Laura Lyons are to be assumed as she faces the predicament of dealing with an abusive father on the one hand and an abusive husband on the other. Nonetheless, Mortimer has previously stated that he does not believe Mrs. Lyons to be completely blameless, and so some prejudice toward her has already been injected into the narrative. Certainly, Watson’s suspicions about her are not completely allayed after his interview with her. In the original manuscript of this chapter (Chapter 11 is the only portion of the work, aside from single pages, still known to exist in manuscript form), Watson’s suspicions are voiced somewhat more strongly: “Either she was an accomplished actor and a deep conspirator, or Barrymore had misread the letter, or the letter was a forgery…” (p. 539). As the text stands, however, we are left with Watson’s grudging conclusion that Mrs. Lyons’ “story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it” (p. 131). (For his own part, Conan Doyle proved an advocate of divorce law reformation, seeking to improve the ease with which women could be granted a divorce, not just a separation.)
Chapter 12: Death on the Moor
Summary: Once Watson has recovered from the shock of the detective’s self-revelation, Holmes explains that he has not, in fact, been occupied with a blackmail case in London; he has been secretly investigating the Baskerville case on his own. (The boy who has been supplying him is Cartwright, from the telegraph office in London.) Watson tells Holmes about his interview with Laura Lyons; Holmes informs Watson that the woman is intimate with Jack Stapleton, and that Beryl Stapleton is, in fact, Jack’s wife and not his sister. Holmes did not know that Lyons was planning to divorce her husband; he surmises that she planned on marring Stapleton, whom she did not know was already married. Holmes has also concluded that Jack was their mysterious, bearded pursuer in the city, and that Beryl sent Sir Henry the cut-and-paste letter of warning. Holmes and Watson hear a terrible scream; they discover a corpse with an expression of terror on its face whom they initially believe to be Sir Henry, based on its clothing, broken upon a rocky ridge. Upon closer examination, however, they discover that the dead man is Selden. Watson recalls how the Barrymores had given Sir Henry’s old clothes to Selden as part of their support for the fugitive. Holmes deduces that the hound—a real hound, not the Hound of legend—must have been trained to track Sir Henry based upon an item of his clothing (likely the boot stolen from Sir Henry at the hotel in London). Jack Stapleton approaches Holmes and Watson and expresses shock at Selden’ death. He claims to have been concerned for Sir Henry because he had invited the baronet to come to the Stapletons’ home that night, and he never arrived; when he heard the screams, he says, he grew worried.
Analysis: This chapter provides some additional insights into Holmes’ characters, showing us as it does the detective’s obvious enjoyment of having befuddled Watson with his unexpected appearance. Watson describes Holmes’ voice as “cold, incisive, [and] ironical” (p. 139), adjectives that could as easily describe the man himself as well as his manner of speaking! And yet perhaps not entirely cold: although surely Holmes is pleased with himself at having surprised the good doctor, he is also concerned (albeit to a lesser extent) with his colleague’s feelings. When Watson complains that he thinks he should “have deserved better [treatment] at [Holmes’] hands,” Holmes assures Watson that his “zeal and intelligence” while on his own have “been invaluable” (p. 141). Knowing that Watson is “rather raw over the deception” (p. 141), Holmes praises him—not, it seems, insincerely—and seems genuinely pleased to see “the shadow rise from [Watson’s] face” as a result (p. 142). Thus, while Holmes does remain primarily concerned with his own methods and the mystery at hand, readers see that he is not completely without human feeling and sensitivities. They are simply not his normal modus operandi! As he tells Stapleton at the chapter’s end, “[a]n investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours” (p. 150)—nor, it seems, undue emotional material, except insofar as it may explain the motives of those involved in a case. (For example, he does understand that Laura Lyons may be more forthcoming when she “is undeceived” of the notion that Beryl Stapleton is Jack’s sister, p. 144). The chapter also shows us that Holmes is not infallible (merely nearly so!). He makes the same mistake Watson does when finding the body upon the moor: he initially identifies it as Sir Henry simply because the corpse wears the baronet’s clothing. Nor is Holmes completely unflappable: when he and Watson hear Selden’s dying screams, Watson notes that Holmes, “the man of iron, was shaken to the soul” (p. 145).
Chapter 13: Fixing the Nets
Summary: Holmes instructs Watson to keep all knowledge of the hound that tracked Selden a secret from Sir Henry, in order that the baronet may be better prepared to face dinner with the Stapletons the next evening. Holmes has a plan that hinges upon Sir Henry’s attendance. At Baskerville Hall, Watson tells the Barrymores of Selden’s death; the husband seems relieved, but his wife, Selden’s sister, weeps with grief. While speaking with Sir Henry, Holmes takes notice of the portraits of his ancestors, including a portrait of Hugo Baskerville, who seems, to Holmes’ eyes, “a quiet, meek-mannered man enough,” and not the reprobate of legend whose exploits supposedly brought the curse of the Hound upon his line. When Sir Henry leaves, Holmes points out to Watson how much Stapleton resembles Hugo. Holmes concludes that Stapleton must be, in fact, a member of the Baskerville family, scheming to take Sir Henry’s inheritance. The next morning, Holmes announces that he and Watson will be returning to London prior to the dinner engagement with the Stapletons. Holmes insists that Sir Henry relay the message to the Stapletons that he and Watson hope to return soon, and also to drive to Merripit House but then announce his intention to walk home across the moor, alone, after dinner. Sir Henry does not understand why Holmes is reversing his previous counsel, but agrees to do so. Later, in Coombe Tracey, Holmes instructs young Cartwright to send a telegram in Holmes’ name to Sir Henry, requesting the baronet return a dropped pocketbook by registered mail to Baker Street. When Cartwright returns from the telegram office, he brings a wire from Inspector Lestrade for Holmes, indicating that the police officer is on his way with an unsigned warrant. Holmes and Watson visit Laura Lyons, telling her the truth about Stapleton and learning from her that Jack Stapleton’s dictated the letter she sent to Sir Charles, but also telling her not to keep the appointment with him (protesting that he alone wanted to give her financial assistance, that they might be married).
Analysis: This chapter’s events and revelations contribute to readers’ sense that we are approaching the dénouement, chief among them the fact that Stapleton is, in fact, a Baskerville. This identity supplies him with a motive for mischief and murder, as Watson realizes: “designs upon the succession” to Baskerville Hall (p. 156). Laura Lyons’ information, too, clarifies matters: Stapleton was arranging a way to lure Sir Charles to a secret meeting, a meeting at which he could take action against him. As Holmes says, “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us” (p. 162). His confidence, indeed, borders on hubris, as befits his character: “I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times” (p. 162). It only borders on that overweening pride, however, because, of course, Holmes will be proven correct (in fact, within the narrative’s world, the very existence of the story bears out his judgment—else Watson would not be reporting it!). This lesson is one that Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard has long since taken to heart. Lestrade is a recurring chacter in Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes “canon.” At his initial meeting with Holmes (in the very first story, A Study in Scarlet), he did indeed express “scorn” at Holmes’ theories; now, however, he has “learned a good deal” and is “reverential” toward the detective, eager to assist him (p. 162).
One notable passage in this chapter preserves the humanity of Selden, the dead criminal, as his sister, Mrs. Barrymore, grieves for him: “To all the world”—and, indeed, to Watson, when he spotted the escaped convict on the moor—Selden “was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little willful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him” (p. 153). Watson’s words are a touching reminder of the common humanity uniting all people. (Another reminder may be seen in Holmes’ laughter, ominous though it is for such criminals! Watson remarks that Holmes’ laughter is rare, and, indeed, it seems to be so. According to Klinger [p. 27], one Sherlock Holmes enthusiast has found 65 instances of a laugh and 31 instances of a “chuckle” in all 60 Holmes stories!)
Chapter 14: The Hound of the Baskervilles
Summary: Holmes, Watson and Lestrade return to Dartmoor and walk through a fog-covered night upon the moors to Merripit House, where a concealed Watson observes Sir Henry and Jack Stapleton alone, conversing over cigars, coffee and wine after their dinner. Watson watches as Stapleton leaves the room and goes to an out-house which he enters and from which Watson hears “a curious scuffling noise.” He rejoins Sir Henry, and Watson reports what he has seen to the detective and the police inspector. The three wait, in suspense, for Sir Henry to begin his way back to Baskerville Hall. When he finally does so, they see a terrifying hound, apparently glowing with unearthly fire, chasing the baronet. Holmes and Watson fire revolvers at the beast, but not before it attacks Sir Henry, going for his throat. Empting his gun’s chamber into the hound, Holmes kills it before it can kill Sir Henry. The animal is a bred combination of bloodhound and mastiff, its mouth and eyes having been made up with phosphorous. Upon entering Merripit House, the men find Mrs. Stapleton bound and gagged; when they free her, she tells them that Jack has fled to a tin mine on an island in the middle of Grimpen Mire. The dense, rolling fog prevents Holmes and his party from giving chase. The next morning, they discover Sir Henry’s missing boot—which Stapleton used to put the hound on the baronet’s scent and then flung away as he fled, having heard Holmes’ and Watson’s pistol shots—and traces of Stapleton’s presence in the tin mine where he housed the ferocious animal, but no sign of Stapleton himself. He is presumed to have sunk deep into the miry bog.
Analysis: The penultimate chapter of Conan Doyle’s novel is a classic of suspense. As previously, the author here again uses his story’s setting for its fullest effect, creating an appropriately tense atmosphere: The fog “was drifting slowly in our direction… [Holmes] muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift” (p. 165); “So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it… that dense white sea, with the moon silvering on its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on” (p. 166). Further tension is created by Sir Henry’s delay at leaving Merripit House: “the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind” (p. 165). Both elements create the sense that time is standing still, and this narrative delay increases the suspense to the fullest possible degree before it is resolved. Additionally, this chapter is remembered for its remarkable revelation of the hound: “A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen” (p. 167). Watson’s initial descriptions of the beast—“Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame” (p. 167)—create a kind of cognitive dissonance in the first-time reader: could this actually be the supernatural monster long feared by the Baskervilles and their neighbors on the moor? No; we soon learn that the animal has been bred for size and ferocity, and made-up with a “cunning preparation” of phosphorous material (p. 168). Nevertheless, for the moment in which the hound attacks Sir Henry, readers will have to concede that Watson (thus, of course, Conan Doyle!) has achieved the stated aim of making them “share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner” (p. 171). The novel thus illustrates the literary principle of catharsis: a cleansing, purifying emotional release, intended to refresh the spirit. Indeed, Holmes’ words to Mrs. Stapleton (whom her abusive husband has, in cruel irony, treated no better than one of his butterfly specimens) hint at catharsis—the re-ordering a disordered world, both social and emotional—as one of the book’s concerns (a concern it has in common with much detective fiction): “If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone” (p. 171).  The novel’s social world is now set right. The mystery of the hound has been explained in a rational manner; Sir Henry’s life has been spared (indeed, we learn that after world travel the young baronet becomes again “the hale, hearty man that he had been,” p. 171); and, although Stapleton is not made to stand trial for his crime of murdering Sir Charles and Selden, and attempting to murder Sir Henry, he nonetheless faces a certain poetic justice in meeting his fate on the moor: “Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried” (p. 173). (Of course, as some Holmes enthusiasts have pointed out, it may be “premature to announce Stapleton’s death”—see Klinger, p. 600—as any good mystery fan knows, no one can safely be presumed dead without a corpse!)
Chapter 15: A Retrospection
Summary: Some time later, Watson and Holmes review the facts of the Baskerville case. The detective gives final clarification to several points. Stapleton was the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s brother Rodger, who had fled to South America. After having embezzled public money, Stapleton moved, with his bride Beryl Garcia, to England, where, having changed his name, he established his school (the one true point of his biography that Stapleton had revealed to Watson). Changing his name for the last and final time, he and Beryl moved to Devonshire. Learning that only Sir Charles and Sir Henry stood in the way of his family fortune, he made plans to kill them, using his wife as a decoy and a hidden hound, disguised to look like the Hound of legend, as his weapon. He won the affections of Laura Lyons, whose unkept appointment (at Stapleton’s arranging) with Sir Charles gave Stapleton the chance to unleash the hound upon him. The hound ran on the grass, leaving no tracks behind and thus contributing to the suggestion of a supernatural event. Now turning his attention to Sir Henry, Stapleton took his wife to London with him—not trusting her enough to leave her alone—where he shadowed Mortimer and Sir Henry in his bearded disguise—and where Beryl sent her warning letter to the young baronet, fearing what her husband might do. Stapleton bribed the hotel staff in order to obtain an article of Sir Henry’s clothing, the boot, that the hound could use to track the heir. (While Stapleton was in the city, he left the hound in the care of Anthony, an elderly servant who had been connected with Stapleton for several years, since his stay in South America.) Holmes then conducted his secret surveillance of Stapleton, claiming a non-existent blackmailing case demanded his attention; when ready, he revealed himself to Watson, and the case entered its final phase. When Stapleton learned that Beryl knew of Selden’s death and held him responsible, he beat and bound her so that she would have no chance to warn Sir Henry. Holmes regrets having felt compelled to use Sir Henry as “bait,” but takes comfort in the fact that the baronet will recover in time. The case thus satisfactorily resolved, Holmes and Watson prepare for dinner and an evening at the opera.
Analysis: The novel’s final chapter admirably accomplishes the purpose of detective fiction, mentioned earlier: of putting a disordered society back to order, of restoring ease to a dis-eased world. Much of the information Holmes covers is, of course, already known to careful readers by this point (although there is some new information included, such as the introduction of Stapleton’s servant Anthony, and the speculations about how Stapleton would have claimed Baskerville Hall had his plot succeeded). Nonetheless, logical and aesthetic gratification is to be found in Holmes “kindly giv[ing Watson] a sketch of the course of events” (p. 175). The summary gives the readers a final opportunity to put all the details of the case in order, to distinguish between true clues and false leads (for instance, the litigious character of Frankland emerges as largely irrelevant, save for his role in exacerbating his daughter Laura’s plight), and thus either reassuring themselves that they have successfully matched wits with Holmes (and, by extension, the author), or—more likely Conan Doyle’s intent—having one more chance to marvel at his abilities. Holmes speaks with the barest possible amount of false modesty—e.g., “That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this [trauma] is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,” pp. 181-82; and, in fact, some readers have concurred: “Ian McQueen chides Holmes for not having anticipated the overwhelming possibility of sudden fog, and for taking his oversight lightly,” Klinger, p. 610); but on the whole it is clear that Holmes is satisfied with his investigation—as is evident in the fact that, by the time Watson inquires about it at the chapter’s outset, Holmes has already moved on to more pressing matters: “the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us” (p. 175). And although he indirectly thanks Watson again for his role (particularly the information that Stapleton used to be a headmaster), he stresses, “I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations” (p. 181). It is thus both curious and ironic that the great detective, who so clearly views himself as self-sufficient, should be forever linked in the popular imagination with the man he once called “my Boswell” (“A Study in Scarlet”): readers cannot think of Sherlock Holmes without also thinking of the character through whose writings (ostensibly) we come to know him, Dr. John Watson. The two are an inseparable pair, and thus it is pleasing to see them planning to enjoy a night in London society together as the book draws to its close. That detail, too, reinforces the satisfactory sense of proper resolution to all things, that sense of well-being and order that is one of the enduring appeals of the Sherlock Holmes “canon.” As author and Holmes enthusiast Vincent Starrett wrote in his poem, “221B”:
Here dwell together still two men of note
Who never lived and so can never die:
How very near they seem, yet how remote
That age before the world went all awry.
But still the game’s afoot for those with ears
Attuned to catch the distant view-halloo:
England is England yet, for all our fears–
Only those things the heart believes are true.
A yellow fog swirls past the window-pane
As night descends upon this fabled street:
A lonely hansom splashes through the rain,
The ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet.
Here, though the world explode, these two survive,
And it is always eighteen ninety-five.
elief teѢlles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.

Elizabeth explained to her friend that she had had several lovers before marrying Tom Willard, and she had married him because he was available when she was ready to be married. Her father tried to convince her not to marry Tom, but to take $800 he had saved and flee. When she decided to marry Tom anyway, he gave her the money and encouraged her never to tell Tom about it. Very quickly, her marriage was a disappointment. She hid the money behind her wall and left it there for many years. She died before she could tell her son George, who is eighteen years old, about the money. After his mother's death, George decided he would leave Winesburg and get a job on a city newspaper somewhere. As he sat in the room with his mother's corpse, he also imagined himself kissing Helen White, but then he felt ashamed of his thoughts and began to cry. He left the room sobbing and full of grief.
	Analysis
	In this text, people are caged by their lives and their beliefs. Death and passion both represent a type of escape or release from the unhappiness of everyday life. Elizabeth held onto the money, hoping for ""the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms"" (236). The passions of sexual desire or of death are both promises of release from the strictures that keep people from connecting with one another. 
	Caught up in the release that comes with passion of any kind, three men call Elizabeth ""You dear! You lovely dear!"" (231), but they cannot provide her with a permanent release because they do not fully understand her and only express this appreciation in moments of passion. Once the passion is over, the connection between the two people fades and the people are left with the cages of everyday life.

671,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Departure","Summary
	George Willard leaves Winesburg to go make his way in the big city. Several people see him off at the station, but Helen White is too late to wish him farewell. He thinks of mundane things as he waits for the train to pull out of the station. The conductor, who has seen many young men starting off on this journey, says nothing to George about what an important day this is.
	Analysis
	This is a rather hopeful ending for a text that has not been terribly optimistic. George is off to make his fortune in the world, but he can only do so alone, by saying goodbye to all his human connections. He is impatient with the people there to see him off, because this is his adventure, not theirs. In the final moment, he is a metaphor for everyone's lives; we are all alone on the train of existence, and any connection we make with others is destined to be fleeting.

672,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Drink","Summary
	Tom Foster moved to Winesburg with his grandmother as a teenager. She cleans Banker White's house. Tom used to be the stable boy at the Whites' house, but because he is rather dreamy and irresponsible, he lost that position. Now, he does odd jobs and is quite happy. His grandmother comes regularly to clean his rented rooms, and he has a rather oddly disciplined approach to life experiences. He wants to do things, but he chooses specific experiences and then goes out and intentionally lives them. For example, having fallen in love with Helen White, he limits what he allows himself to think about her. One night, he decides he ought to try drinking to see what it feels like. He buys a bottle of whiskey and walks about a mile north of town, where he sits on a bank of grass and gets drunk. In his drunkenness, he goes and talks to George Willard about Helen. George is upset at first, but then they cement a bond between them. Tom decides that, now that he has been drunk, he will not need to try it again.
	Analysis
	Just as those who are overly severe or overly excited are grotesques, Tom is a grotesque because he is overly dreamy and sensitive. None of the characters in this text have a balance of characteristics; instead, they are all defined by one exaggerated belief or characteristic. Tom may be pleasant to be around, but his overly sensitive nature is no more practical in the real world than Ed Handby's violence or Seth Richmond's silence.

673,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Godliness I - VI","Godliness I
	This is the first in a four-part story. Jesse Bentley was born sensitive in a family of rough farmers. He went off to study for the ministry and married an equally delicate woman. When all his four older brothers died in the Civil War, he came home to run the farm. Although he was sensitive, there was a strength that ran through him and made him survive a rougher life. He made a success of running the farm, even though no one expected him to be able to do so. Because he was intellectual in an age that did not lend itself to intellectual pursuits, he channeled that energy into a fervent belief in God. In doing so, he became something of a tyrant, feared by his employees. He believed that he had been specially chosen by God, and that all the people in the area were Philistines. He also believed that he needed a son to smite them. His wife died in childbirth.
	Godliness II
	Jesse did not have a son. His daughter, Louise, grew up to be a shrill and unhappy woman. She married a banker, John Hardy, and went to live in town. She has a son, David, who is timid and frightened much of the time because his mother is so erratic. Once, returning from his grandfather's farm, he runs away from home. When he returns, he is pleasantly surprised to find his mother is tender for the evening.
	David goes to live with his grandfather. He is happy on the farm, and everyone dotes on him. Once, his grandfather becomes possessed of the spirit of God while out in the wilderness with David, but this just terrifies the young boy. Other than this frightening event, however, the farm feels comfortable to him. One of his great-aunts mothers him, and he gets love he never felt at home.
	Godliness III: Surrender
	Louise grew up in a loveless household, as her father had always wanted a boy and her mother had died. As a teenager, she went to live in town to attend school. She lived in the Hardy household. The two Hardy girls hated her because she was such a good student, which was awful for her because all she wanted was love. When she reached out to their brother, John, he misunderstood and thought she wanted to become his lover. She mistakenly thought she was pregnant, and they ended up married. Because John could never understand the emptiness and need for love that drove her to him, Louise turned into a bitter woman. She neglects her son, David.
	Godliness IV: Terror
	The last part of the story returns to the story of Jesse, who meets with great financial success on his farming ventures. He decides to take his fifteen-year-old grandson, David, out into the woods to help him sacrifice a lamb. But he does not tell David what his plan is, and David becomes terrified when his grandfather approaches him and the lamb with a large knife. David runs away. When Jesse pursues him, David hits him with a stone from a slingshot. Thinking he has killed his grandfather, he flees Winesburg for good. Jesse's ambition is chastened by the loss of his beloved grandson.
	Analysis
	In the Bible, David slays Goliath the giant with a slingshot. That image is reproduced here. Jesse believes he is a man with a special connection to God, but he is actually a tyrant who needs to be slain. He believes so strongly in one truth, that he is a man chosen by God and surrounded by Philistines, that he has become warped into a grotesque. His single-minded pursuit of godliness through hard work killed his wife and turned his daughter into a miserable woman. Because he believes his grandson is part of his godliness, he makes David's life wonderful. Eventually, however, his belief goes too far and he destroys even that relationship. The truth he has embraced has destroyed every chance he had for human connectedness.

674,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Hands","Summary
	Wing Biddlebaum, a forty-year-old man, lives on the outskirts of Winesburg and has little involvement in the community in which he has lived for twenty years. Wing is the kind of man who talks a lot with his hands. He has ""slender expressive fingers, forever active,"" and his natural tendency is to gesticulate a lot as he speaks. His story is ""a story of hands."" When he was younger, he was a gifted schoolteacher in Pennsylvania, much loved by the boys at his school. Wing's name was then Adolph Myers. However, a disturbed, half-witted boy said that Myers molested him. Since he did have a tendency to touch students in an affectionate way, people believed this boy. A man from the town named Henry Bradford came to the school and beat Myers up. Then in the night, a dozen men came to Myers's door with a rope in their hands, intending to lynch him, but he managed to escape. He moved to Winesburg and made up a new name. Now, he is afraid of letting his hands do whatever they like, so he tries to keep them contained. His only friend is the young reporter, George Willard, who sometimes comes to talk to him.
	Analysis
	Wing is a grotesque because he has constrained his hands, instruments of affection and gentleness, with the truth that a man should not lay hands on another. He has been warped by his efforts to keep himself confined within that truth.

675,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Loneliness","Summary
	Enoch Robinson is a childish man who seems crazy. He grew up on a farm near Winesburg, and he used to want to be an artist. When he was twenty-one he went to live in New York City, where he remained for fifteen years. There, he made friends who were artists, and they came to visit him in his little rented room. They talked of the composition of his pictures, but he felt they did not understand the art. Then, he stopped letting them come visit and instead invented people to keep him company in his room, people he could better control. Eventually, he married an art student, but that, too did not work out because of his egotism. He wanted people who exactly suited his needs, rather than real people, so he left his wife and two children, returned to his room, and continued imagining people. Finally, a young woman started visiting him again, and he tried to make her understand about his people, but she realized he was crazy and ran away. He ran after her and tried to explain, but he ended up swearing at her, instead. When she left, she took all the life and imagined people out of his room. He returned to Winesburg to live out his life alone and defeated.
	Analysis
	The big city, with all its promise, could not give Enoch Robinson what he wanted. It is a lonely place, where he fails to establish connections with people. Instead, he populates his own village within the city. This does not make him an artist; it makes him immature because he cannot interact with other people. While people go away to the city to find something bigger or better than they can get in Winesburg, they are left with shattered dreams when they fail to make a connection with others.

	Elizabeth Willard owns the Winesburg hotel, which she inherited from her parents. Her husband, Tom, runs the shabby, unnprofitable hotel and behaves as though he is a very important man. He has a dream that one day he will become a Congressman or even governor. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has faded away and does not like to be seen by people. She feels defeated by life. However, she believes she has a special relationship with her son George, who sometimes comes to sit in her room with her when she is sick. But, they are just awkward with each other. One time, she hears her husband admonishing her son to be bold, and she wants desperately to communicate with George that he should not be too slick but should instead harbor dreams. Unfortunately, she is unable to communicate this to George.
	Analysis
	Elizabeth has big dreams that her son, George, will live the dreams she did not live. She wants him to be able to grope and find a way of expressing himself truly, rather than living a life of surface and convention. However, she is unable to express this to George because their awkwardness intervenes. Instead, she lives caged in her own unfulfilled dreams.

	Doctor Reefy, an old man with a white beard, once had a wife, but she died young. Now he lives alone and has become eccentric; he has worn one suit of clothes for ten years, which is now frayed at the sleeves and has holes at the knees and elbows. He has only one friend in the town, another old man.
	Doctor Reefy met his wife when she was a patient. A lover had made her pregnant, but she lost the child. She and the doctor fell in love even though she was younger than he, and he showed her how sweet gnarled apples can be. He shared with her the thoughts that he wrote down on little pieces of paper. Now that she is gone, he has no one to share the thoughts with. They sit in his pockets till they become little balls of paper, then he throws them away.
	Analysis
	Deprived of his attempt to connect with another person, the doctor spends his life creating truths that are then transformed into hard little balls. Truths are not magnificent, high-flown ideas once they are written down, because they then become mere scraps of paper. Truth is only beautiful when lived, which is what the doctor did with his wife. Without the human connection, they are meaningless.

678,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Queer","Summary
	Elmer Cowley is the son of Ebenezer Cowley, a farmer who sold his farm a year ago and became a storekeeper. Ebenezer is not much of a merchant, as he just buys up a jumble of things that cannot really be sold. One time, Elmer threatens a merchant who tries to sell them an item they will never be able to sell again. He is bitter that his family is so odd and he thinks that everyone in the town laughs at them because of it. He takes a walk and tries to talk to a simple-minded man who remained on the Cowley farm, but he is unable to communicate his frustration. When he sees George Willard happen to look at him, Elmer flies into a rage, thinking the reporter is considering how odd the Cowleys are. Yet, when he confronts George, he cannot find words to tell him how he feels and just sputters with anger. He steals $20 from his father to take the local train to the city, where he plans to join the anonymous rush of people. He wakes up George and tells him to come down to the station, intending to tell the young man that he is not strange. Again, words fail him, and he gives George the $20 to return to his father and then beats up George before jumping on the train.
	Analysis
	Elmer believes that ""George Willard. belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town.. Did he not represent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness?"" (195). George is again thought to represent the town because he is the reporter, collecting the stories of everyone in town. For Elmer, making himself understood to George would vindicate him in the eyes of the town. He wants to be considered normal, to blend into a crowd, which is why he is going to the big city, where he expects to disappear into anonymity. However, even in the big city, there is loneliness. Elmer is lonely in a small town because he stands out, but Enoch was lonely in a big city where he blended in.
	The characters hope that moving from one place to another will give them a chance to make a meaningful connection with another person. This is why trains are so prominent in this book. Travel is a modern condition, in which people can leave small towns or cities easily. However, they cannot flee the essential human condition of loneliness, which just takes different forms in different settings.

679,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Respectability, The Thinker & Tandy","Respectability
	Wash Williams is a huge, dirty, misshapen man who looks something like an ugly monkey. He has no friends and he hates women. Only George Willard knows his story. Wash had a beautiful wife who he loved in his own lovely youth, when he worked in the telegraph office in Columbus, Ohio. Then, he found out she had lovers and sent her back to her mother's house. When her mother asked Wash to come see his wife in Dayton, he would have taken her back if her mother had not devised a plan that horrified him and destroyed his belief in women. She sent Wash's wife into the room naked, hoping that would make him take her back. Wash was shocked and attacked his wife's mother with a chair. Now he despises all women and pities all men. This event also made the telegraph operator much less effective in his job, and he was transferred to Winesburg.
	The Thinker
	Seth Richmond is a young man with a rather forbidding kind of demeanor. He is so quiet that people think he is a deep thinker and are intimidated by him. Actually, he is just a manipulative person who does not have much to say. Even his mother is frightened by him. Once, he ran away with some other youths to the county fair and spent a few days stealing farmers' lunches and having fun. Upon his return, he manipulated his mother so she did not admonish him. When George Willard decides to be in love with Helen White, he asks Seth to speak to her on his behalf, since Seth knows Helen better than he does. Seth is irritated by this request and leaves abruptly. He thinks George is a fool. Seth wanders the streets for a while, feeling depressed because he does not feel part of the life of his own town. Eventually, he reaches the Whites' house. Helen answers the door and he invites her for a walk. He tells her that he is going away to Columbus and talks about his plans to get into the university there. He says nothing about George. Helen is impressed by Seth's determination. There is affection between them but neither knows how to express it. After they part, Seth thinks that Helen will end up with someone like George rather than with him.
	Tandy
	This brief story tells of how a girl named Tandy acquired her name. When Tandy was a little girl, her family did not pay much attention to her. One day, a drunken stranger told her that her name should be Tandy and that she could then be all that men want from a woman. After that, the little girl insisted on being called Tandy. The drunken man left Winesburg with nothing to show for his attempts to get sober.
	Analysis
	All three of these stories focus on the difficulty of relations between men and women. Men and women simply cannot communicate with one another. Wash adored his wife, but they had secrets and the relationship clearly was not based on open communication. His mother-in-law misunderstood and thought that the relationship was simply sexual, and so she disgusted him. A relationship that he hoped would be a sustaining and fulfilling one turned out to be just a base, physical relationship, and so he is disgusted by all relationships. So, too, does Seth Richmond have communication problems. Everyone assumes that he is deep because of his silence, but ""no great underlying purpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had no definite plan for his life"" (127). He is simply blustering, and so the moment of connection with Helen White is empty of honest communication. His mother's fear of him is also based on her misunderstanding his silence.
	Tandy's story should be a moving one, because a stranger has given her a strong identity. Actually, his strong desire for women to fulfill his needs has led him to place his own desires upon her, whether she is really that person or not. Tandy, he explains, is a quality: ""something men need from women and that they do not get"" (141). Of course, she is just a little child, and he is projecting his needs upon her. This creates a great deal of stress for the child, who now feels she needs to live up to being Tandy.
	These stories also reflect the city/small town divide. Wash had lived in the city with his young wife, and that is where everything went wrong. He has been sent to this small town because he is not fit to be a big city telegraph operator. Seth claims he is going to leave the town and go to the city. George Willard, he thinks ""belongs to this town"" but he himself does not because he is too silent (131). The town is provincial, where people know each other, George gathers up their stories, and people chat with each other. The town also has limited opportunity, which is why Seth claims to be leaving and why Wash was sent there. Young men who want to get ahead, like Ned Currie, go to the city, but then they lose their connection with people that they have in the town. Perhaps this is why Seth is so ambivalent about going away from the town. What he really wants is to be someone in the small town who is important enough to be leaving for the city.

680,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Sophistication","Summary
	George Willard is thinking of Helen White on the day of the county fair, and she is thinking of George, even though she is stuck with a college instructor of hers who has come to town for the day. In the evening, her mother insinuates that this instructor would be a good match for Helen and keeps the two talking on the porch. Helen leaves the house and runs into George on his way to visit her. They go off together to the fairgrounds and spend some time together. They embrace a little and talk a little. Then, they play around like two small animals. After they goof around, they feel satisfied and ready to be adults.
	Analysis
	This is one of the few moments in the text where two people connect in an authentic way. The connection, like all others, is fleeting, because people are meant to spend their adult lives caught up in the truths they construct around themselves. But, for a moment, these two people are connected. It is a lovely moment, not meant to last but appreciated because they both need it at that point in their lives. Connection, then, is not so much about permanent relationships, such as marriage or parenthood, but about getting the right moment of interaction at the right time.

681,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: The Book of the Grotesque","Summary
	An old writer has a bed that his carpenter raised up so the writer can see out the window. Unfortunately, it is now difficult for him to get in and out of the bed. From this bed, he dreams ""a dream that was not a dream"" (5) in which all the people has had ever known pass before his eyes. These figures are grotesques. From this parade of figures, he creates the stories in this book.
	Analysis
	It is important to note the definition of ""grotesques"" that he provides in this early section. Men create ""truths"" about the world: ""There was the truth of virginity and the truth of passion, the truth of wealth and of poverty, of thrift and of profligacy, of carelessness and abandon."" These truths are beautiful in themselves, but when a person takes them for himself, they become limited and limiting. A truth is beautiful because there are other truths that are its opposite, but when it is instead a rigid principle to which a person adheres, it can deform the person who keeps trying to fit into it. ""It was his notion that the moment one of the people took one of the truths to himself, called it his truth, and tried to live his life by it, he became a grotesque and the truth he embraced became a falsehood"" (6). Winesburg, Ohio, is about people who have treated truths as guiding principles of life instead of beautiful, fluid possibilities and are hence deformed by their truths.

	Doctor Parcival is one of the town's three doctors, but he has very few patients. Nonetheless, he is financially comfortable. He likes to visit George Willard at the offices of the Winesburg Eagle to tell the young man about his ideas. He tells stories about his past life, but many times they are contradictory, so George does not know what to believe. He also tries to instruct George to distrust and dislike all other people. When he refuses to come attend to a dead girl, Doctor Parcival thinks the people will lynch him. He tells George that, if he is killed, George should write his book for him: ""The idea is very simple, so simple that if you are not careful you will forget it. It is this-that everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified"" (42).
	Nobody Knows
	George Willard meets Louise Trunnion at her urging and the two of them have a liaison in the night. At first, she plays coy and asks how he knows she even wants to go with him, which annoys George, as she sent a note inviting him. The note said, ""I'm yours if you want me."" George is not particularly interested in Louise, but he takes the opportunity that presents itself to him. He walks away from their encounter in a field reassuring himself that no one will know about their sexual contact and so she will not be able to accuse him of anything.
	Analysis
	All of the people in this book are stuck on some idea or another that limits their ability to function within the world. Doctor Parcival's idea is that cruelty makes some people superior to others and that everyone is persecuted. Like the others in the book, he feels the need to share his thoughts with George. People like to unburden themselves to George because he is a good listener, which is probably why he is a good reporter.
	The lonely characters in this book find that George is a person they can connect to in one way or another. Louise, too, turns to George for some kind of human connection, albeit a physical one. All people are lonely, isolated by their ""truths,"" and yet they keep hoping to connect to one another. George, who is still young and has not become a grotesque, provides that opportunity.

683,"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: The Strength of God & The Teacher","The Strength of God
	Reverend Curtis Hartman, the minister of Winesburg's Presbyterian Church, regularly prays to be more fervent and more religious. One night, he looks out the window of his study in the bell tower of the church and sees in a room in a neighboring house the bare shoulders of a woman reading a book and smoking. He has had limited experience with women, and he is both shocked and attracted. He then enters into a many month period of struggle with his own desire to watch this woman, whose name is Kate Swift, read and smoke. Sometimes, he resists; sometimes, he cannot help peeking. Finally, he gives in to temptation and sits by the window, waiting for her to arrive. He breaks the glass of his window so he can see her and sits by the window in a storm. When she finally does arrive, she is weeping and then prays naked. Hartman stumbles out of the church and into the street. He feels he has been delivered from his temptation and that Kate Swift is an agent of God. He informs George Willard that he has been delivered by the body of a woman.
	The Teacher
	Much of this story takes place on the same night that the Reverend Hartman sees Kate Swift naked and praying. Kate lives with her mother, Aunt Elizabeth, in Winesburg. She has traveled and lived in cities, but then she returned to be the schoolteacher. She seems stern and forbidding, except when her passion for life overtakes her and she becomes a vibrant teacher. She is actually quite passionate. George Willard was her student, and she thought she recognized something of a genius in him. She has spoken with him several times in hopes of communicating to him all her dreams for him to become a true writer. On this stormy night, her passion for imparting this knowledge gets confused with sexual passion, and they embrace. She runs out, frustrated that he will not understand her. Shortly thereafter, Reverend Hartman, not knowing what has transpired between Kate and George that evening, comes into George's office and tells him that Kate Swift is an instrument of God.
	Analysis
	Kate Swift is incredibly passionate. But, there is little outlet for a fervent, intelligent woman in a small town in the early twentieth century. She cannot become the writers about whom she teaches, so she tries to impart her passion for life, beauty, and truth to George Willard. But, like all communication in this text, it gets garbled by the human facts of loneliness and desire. She is so overtaken by her desire to be a part of art that she is a grotesque -- caught in her loneliness.
	The men in these two stories misunderstand her. They, too, want something. The minister wants God to be within him, and George is a young man with sexual passions. They place their desires on her and use her for them, turning her into a receptacle for their own needs. This is much like the drunken man who makes Tandy a receptacle for his own desires.

As he walks home, Ray has a pleasant memory of evenings spent with his children, and he realizes that whatever he had planned to tell Hal would have been a lie.
	Analysis
	After telling the interesting tale of how Hal's father, Windpeter, died, Anderson writes: ""But this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet of his son Hal"" but ""It will. be necessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you will get into the spirit of it"" (204). This is one of several instances in which he tells a bit of a side story and then says that he is not telling that person's story. Anderson is drawing attention to the storyteller. This is a collection of stories about a collection of people, but there are many other stories out there that could be told. These stories may illustrate a particular set of circumstances, but other stories will illustrate other ideas or circumstances. Unlike many novels that pretend to be complete contained worlds, Anderson is drawing the reader's attention to the fact that any story could be a different story if that were what the storyteller chose to focus upon.

685,The Inferno: Novel Summary,"Summary
In the middle of the journey of his life, Dante comes to himself again and realizes he is lost in a dark, savage, threatening forest deep in a valley. He tries all night to find a way out; when he comes to the foot of a high hill and sees the rising sun shining on it, he feels hope and starts to climb. But his way is blocked by three beasts. He thinks he's going to get past the leopard that comes first, but the lion is more fearsome, and the she-wolf drives him back, despairing, to the dark wood. He then sees a human shape and calls out for help. It is the shade of Virgil, the great Roman poet of the time of the emperor Augustus, from whom he as a poet has learned so much, and Dante begs him for help against the she-wolf. Virgil tells him that the she-wolf is too fierce to get by, that she is ravaging all of Italy, and will do so until the person comes who can chase her back to Hell. But Virgil promises to get him out of the dark wood, not by taking him past the beasts, but by leading him through Hell. Once he has seen those who suffer in Hell, Virgil will lead him up the mountain of Purgatory, where souls become ready for eternal bliss, and then someone else will take over and lead him up to Heaven. Virgil can't go there because, living before Christianity had spread, he was not a Christian. Dante accepts Virgil's guidance joyfully, and they set out.
	Analysis
	Dante called his epic poem his Commedia, his comedy, because it had a happy ending and used ordinary language; others soon started calling it The Divine Comedy, and many consider it the greatest poem ever written. Never before had any poet written an epic poem about the poet's own life; epics had always been about heroes, who spent most of their time fighting. Dante writes about a turning point in his own journey, a midlife crisis. He writes about it in the form of an allegory, in which all the inner drama takes on outer form; thus his turmoil and misery are pictured as the state of being lost in a dark forest. So we can say that on the literal level, the Inferno is the story of a man who, with a wise guide, is able to travel down through the pit of Hell step by step, seeing at each level the tortures of the damned, and finally emerging on the other side of the earth to begin an upward climb.

686,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 1,"Summary
	In the middle of the journey of his life, Dante comes to himself again and realizes he is lost in a dark, savage, threatening forest deep in a valley. He tries all night to find a way out; when he comes to the foot of a high hill and sees the rising sun shining on it, he feels hope and starts to climb. But his way is blocked by three beasts. He thinks he's going to get past the leopard that comes first, but the lion is more fearsome, and the she-wolf drives him back, despairing, to the dark wood. He then sees a human shape and calls out for help. It is the shade of Virgil, the great Roman poet of the time of the emperor Augustus, from whom he as a poet has learned so much, and Dante begs him for help against the she-wolf. Virgil tells him that the she-wolf is too fierce to get by, that she is ravaging all of Italy, and will do so until the person comes who can chase her back to Hell. But Virgil promises to get him out of the dark wood, not by taking him past the beasts, but by leading him through Hell. Once he has seen those who suffer in Hell, Virgil will lead him up the mountain of Purgatory, where souls become ready for eternal bliss, and then someone else will take over and lead him up to Heaven. Virgil can't go there because, living before Christianity had spread, he was not a Christian. Dante accepts Virgil's guidance joyfully, and they set out.
	Analysis
	Dante called his epic poem his Commedia, his comedy, because it had a happy ending and used ordinary language; others soon started calling it The Divine Comedy, and many consider it the greatest poem ever written. Never before had any poet written an epic poem about the poet's own life; epics had always been about heroes, who spent most of their time fighting. Dante writes about a turning point in his own journey, a midlife crisis. He writes about it in the form of an allegory, in which all the inner drama takes on outer form; thus his turmoil and misery are pictured as the state of being lost in a dark forest. So we can say that on the literal level, the Inferno is the story of a man who, with a wise guide, is able to travel down through the pit of Hell step by step, seeing at each level the tortures of the damned, and finally emerging on the other side of the earth to begin an upward climb. (If you share the common notion that people thought the earth was flat before Columbus, put it aside. Anyone with any education knew the earth was round. Even the most learned in the Middle Ages, however, did believe that it was the center of the universe, around which everything else revolved.)

",The Inferno
687,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 2,"Summary
	Dante and Virgil have set out, and Dante the narrator invokes the Muses to help him tell the story, as epic poets have always done. But the first thing he has to tell shows how very unheroic, at least in some ways, is the ""hero"" he has chosen: Dante the pilgrim hesitates. Who is he to undertake such a journey? Yes, others have journeyed through the Underworld or visited Heaven-Aeneas, whose story Virgil himself told in his epic poem, the Aeneid, and St. Paul. But Dante's not on their level, he tells Virgil. Virgil diagnoses Dante's problem as cowardice, and tells him the story of the blessed and beautiful lady, Beatrice, who came to Virgil in Limbo, the outermost part of Hell where he inhabits, to urge him to save Dante. She came from Heaven, through the grace of the Virgin Mary and St. Lucy, Dante's favorite saint, and if three such ladies want to save Dante, how can he hesitate? And indeed Dante feels new courage spread through his whole being and tells Virgil he is really ready to follow him now.
	Analysis
	In some allegories, the characters are not real people but personified abstractions, as in the pictures of Justice as a blind woman holding scales, or the Statue of Liberty holding up her torch in New York's harbor. In Dante's allegory, almost all the characters are real people. (The three beasts of the first canto are an exception.) They are themselves, and they stand for something more, in part for some inner quality that in life they really did embody, at least in Dante's opinion. In life, Beatrice was a young woman who grew up, as Dante did, in Florence, in the late thirteenth century, and died young. When she was eight and Dante was nine, he saw her for the first time at a May celebration. So powerful was her effect on him, then and later, that he came to see her as a revelation of the glory of God, sent to draw him to God. For him, she embodied Divine Grace and all the power of Revelation, which reveals God's love to us in a way human reason on its own could never reach. So one can see this canto as saying, ""Human reason can show us how futile it is to seek happiness in the wrong direction and how joyful to seek it through real growth, but it can never grasp the bliss that is waiting for us when our wills are completely guided by universal love."" Many who do not share Dante's theology, especially the doctrine that some souls will stay trapped in the misery they have created for themselves on earth forever in Hell, have still found much real insight in his psychology. For some, the Inferno is above all a study of the hell of addiction, as it is experienced in this life.
",The Inferno
688,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 3,"Summary
	The dire words inscribed over the gate of Hell, which end with the famous words, ""Abandon hope, all ye who enter here"" (line 9), again frighten Dante, and Virgil has to comfort him again, telling him he must give up fear-the words only apply to those who, being dead, are no longer able to choose to turn to God. Once inside the gate he hears the groans of those who, while they were alive, refused to risk choosing either good or evil. They are in a large and undefined area, sometimes called the Vestibule, or Fore-Hell. As Virgil explains, they don't belong in Hell because they lacked the courage to choose evil; if they were in Hell, even the damned would look down on them. They endlessly follow a banner that never takes a stand anywhere, and Dante is amazed how many there are: ""I could never have believed that death had undone so many"" (lines 56-57). Then Dante and Virgil come to the river Acheron, where a great crowd of people wait to cross. Charon, the boatman, at first says that Dante, being alive, cannot cross, but Virgil tells him that Dante's journey is willed by God, and Charon accepts that. The souls who are waiting to cross curse God and their parents and all the circumstances of their lives. Dante is then deprived of consciousness by a sudden movement of the earth and an intense red flash.
	Analysis
	Here for the first time the outer state of a group of souls after death is described in a way that reveals something about the nature of their inner state; in the same way, all the punishments of Hell, described in such graphic detail, are intended to help the reader see the real nature of the choices the souls have made, the truth about what those choices have done to them, or, to put it in other terms, the essence of their sin, which is now their punishment. Seeing the downward way clearly, as it is, is intended to give the reader, like Dante, the courage to choose the upward way. The suffering of the souls in this Fore-Hell reveal what it does to human beings to refuse to make real choices, to lack the courage to try to be happy, even by choosing to do harm to themselves and others. They follow meaningless causes with no real commitment, and their lives are utterly forgotten. Dante sees among these souls someone who is probably meant to be Celestine V, a pope who refused the risk of staying in office and turned over the papacy to Boniface VIII. Dante blamed Boniface for much of the corruption he saw in the church, and for the disaster that had come on his own beloved city, Florence. Seeing the man whose cowardice put Boniface in office, Dante really understands it-to refuse to act is the worst choice of all.
	The souls who are waiting to cross Acheron made, while they were alive, the choice to turn their backs on God. They now blame everyone for that choice except themselves, something we will often see in the lower circles.
",The Inferno
689,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 4,"Summary
	Dante wakes up and finds himself ""on the brink of the abysmal valley of pain"" (lines 7-8). So pitiful are the wailings that rise from that dark valley that Virgil's face is pale with pity, and Dante takes it for fear and hesitates again. But Virgil explains, and they enter the First Circle, also called Limbo. Here there are only sighs, no wailing, and the only suffering, says Virgil, who dwells in this circle, is that ""without hope, we live in desire"" (line 42); all the souls here were virtuous, or at least free of sin, but they were never brought into the Christian Church through baptism, either because they lived before Christianity like Virgil, or because the teachings of Christianity never reached them, or because they died before they could be baptized. Dante is full of grief at hearing this. Has no one ever escaped this circle? Virgil answers that a great conqueror came here shortly after Virgil died and set free Adam, Noah, Moses, and many others.
	Virgil and Dante then come to an area full of light, where those dwell who have won honorable fame and are therefore favored by Heaven. Virgil is welcomed back to this place, which is his home, by the shades of Homer and three other great poets, and all five accept Dante as one of themselves. They walk on to a noble castle, inside of which is a fresh green meadow, and there Dante sees many men and women of Greece and Rome famous for their deeds, as well as the great Muslim leader Saladin, and then the great philosophers of the ancient world, as well as the two Muslim thinkers Avicenna and Averroes, who transmitted much ancient wisdom (including deeper insight into the philosophy of Aristotle) to western Europe.
	Finally Virgil and Dante leave, and he comes out of that quiet and bright place ""to a part where there is no light"" (line 141).
	Analysis
	It has seemed strange to many that the noble souls and the innocent infants in the First Circle must be imagined as having crossed Acheron, along with those sinners who blamed everyone else for their misery. In the Paradiso, Dante the pilgrim gets to ask some questions he's been brooding about, and one of them is how it can be right for virtuous people to be denied the chance to get to Heaven just because they lacked baptism. So we know the question troubled him, and perhaps that trouble is reflected here. One interpretation is that Dante believed it was possible to be virtuous without being able to conceive of God as Universal Love, and that in fact only Christ could reveal that truth. What we cannot know, we cannot choose, and in life after death as Dante conceived of it, people have what they chose while alive. And if we consider the allegorical meaning, the nature of Limbo makes clear that to live even a good and honorable life without knowledge of the true nature of ultimate reality as love and bliss is to live without joy, desiring something more but having no hope of getting it.
	The story Virgil tells of a mighty one carrying away souls from Hell reflects the medieval belief that when Christ ""descended into Hell,"" as the Apostle's Creed states, he ""harrowed"" Hell, defeating Satan and freeing all those who had believed in Christ before his birth.
	Clearly, Dante reverenced all those he here depicts as dwelling in the noble castle, and he is pictured here as honored to be treated as an equal by the five great classical poets. Dante saw himself as restoring poetry to the high level of the achievements of Greece and Rome, and he announces his role here.
",The Inferno
690,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 5,"Summary
	When he first enters the Second Circle, Dante sees Minos, a horrible, snarling demon to whom each soul confesses everything, receiving their sentence from him. Minos warns Dante to turn back, but Virgil again asserts that Dante's journey is divinely ordained.
	Now Dante hears wailing again, in a place where light is mute. A hellish storm drives the spirits ceaselessly through the air like a flock of birds, tormenting them; they have no hope of rest, no hope of less pain. One long line of spirits draws Dante's attention, and he asks Virgil who they are. Virgil tells him of more than a thousand, ""ladies of ancient times and warriors,"" all having died because of love, and Dante is bewildered by pity.
	Dante asks to speak to two who are borne on the wind together, and who ""seem so light on the wind."" Virgil tells him to ask them to come in the name of their love; they swoop down to him like doves borne to their nest by desire. The woman speaks, full of gratitude for Dante's kind interest, and says that all-powerful Love brought them together and holds them together still. Love led to their dying together, and the deepest pit of Hell is waiting for the man who killed them. Dante recognizes her as Francesca and knows the story of her husband finding her with his brother Paolo and killing them both, and he stands silent with head bowed, thinking of the power of the desire that has brought the two lovers here. Telling Francesca that her suffering makes him weep, he asks how she and Paolo first realized they were in love. She tells how they were reading together of Lancelot's love for Guinevere, and ""when we read that the smile so desired was kissed by so great a lover, this man, who will never be parted from me, kissed my mouth, all trembling. A Galeotto [pander, go-between] was that book and the man who wrote it; that day we read no more"" (lines 133-138). As Francesca speaks, Paolo weeps so bitterly that Dante faints from sheer pity.
	Analysis
	This canto is one of the most famous in Dante's Inferno, creating strong reactions in just about everyone who reads it. Paolo and Francesca had been killed only a few years before the year of Dante's journey through the worlds of the afterlife (which he set in 1300), and everyone in Italy at the time knew their story. Some later readers have felt that Dante is showing them as victorious over Hell, since they will be together forever. Others have felt that Dante is showing Francesca as self-deceiving and selfish. What is clear is that Dante is showing himself, at this stage in the journey, as deeply sympathetic with the lovers. We find out in the Purgatorio that he himself tended to be overmastered by desire, and certainly the romantic literature of his day, which he loved, tended to present romantic love as all-powerful and to excuse those who were led by it to break their marriage vows. At the same time, Dante the narrator makes the nature of the punishment reveal the essence of the sin, as so often in the poem: as all those who suffer in the Second Circle allowed themselves to be swept away by passion while they were alive, ignoring the harm they were doing to themselves and others, so now they are swept away forever by a black wind.
	At the same time, it is worth noting that those who give in to their passions and desires, who are, in that sense, incontinent-they cannot contain their impulses-are on the highest levels in Hell, the Circles of Incontinence. The giving in to lust seen in this Second Circle, which at least involves some kind of feeling for another person, is the least serious of all the sins-though it is still mortal. It can kill the soul if one does not realize that this kind of love cannot give real happiness, if one becomes addicted to it.

691,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 6,"Summary
	During his swoon, Dante has somehow been transported to the Third Circle, where cold, dirty rain mixed with hail and snow pours down forever, and the soil stinks. There three-headed Cerberus barks at and tortures the souls, who lie in the mud. Virgil is able to silence him by throwing dirt in his mouth. As Virgil and Dante pass on, one soul sits up and asks Dante if he recognizes him. He is so disfigured that Dante doesn't, but the soul tells him he lived in Dante's city, Florence, so ruined by envy, was called Ciacco (Hog); all the souls in this circle were taken over by gluttony, as he was. Dante expresses his pity for Ciacco, then wants to know is what's going to happen in Florence. Ciacco tells him that the Whites will soon come to power and exile the Blacks, but not for long; the Blacks, with the help of Boniface VIII, will come back and banish the Whites, and stay in power for a long time. There are only two just men in the whole city, and no one listens to them; all the others are ruled by pride, envy, and greed. What about the good men who have held power in Florence in the past, Dante asks. Are they now in Heaven or Hell. You'll see them lower down in Hell, Ciacco answers. Then he makes his one request, that Dante should speak of him when he returns to ""the sweet world"" and so keep his memory alive; he sinks back into the mire with the others, to rise no more, Virgil says, till all souls are reunited with their bodies on Judgment Day. Dante wants to know what effect reuniting with their bodies will have on their suffering, and Virgil explains that it will make it worse. They continue their journey around the circle, until, at the point where the path heads down again, they encounter ""Plutus, the great enemy.""
	Analysis
	The true nature of gluttony is revealed by the lonely wallowing in the mud of the gluttonous souls, and Dante doesn't need to ask Virgil or the soul they meet about it. Rather for the first time, but not the last, the focus is on what is about to happen in Florence. Dante loved his city, then an independent republic, and he was recognized there as a poet and respected as a citizen, even elected to office in 1300. (The two parties that had earlier torn apart Florence with their battles earlier were the Guelphs and the Ghibellines; the Guelphs had triumphed decisively in 1267, and Dante's family was Guelph.) Beatrice had died young, and Dante was married to someone else and had four children. It was during this prosperous and successful time of his life that he chose to set his book, describing himself as beginning his escape from the Dark Wood by descending into Hell on Good Friday of 1300. By this time, the Guelphs had split into the Blacks and the Whites. In Dante's actual life, the banishment of the Whites that Ciacco predicts, which actually happened in 1301, was the beginning of his own exile, since he was a White. The Blacks accused him on trumped-up charges of graft and threatened him and other powerful Whites with death by burning if they ever returned to Florence.
	Exile from Florence was a horrible blow to Dante; its shadow hangs over the whole Divine Comedy. In a sense, the poem is the story of how he became the kind of man who could lose everything and yet give his whole life to serving God and saving his country from the turmoil and corruption he saw everywhere in Florence and in all of Italy. His way of serving was to create a supreme poem to call his fellow Italians back to the true way of gaining happiness, the way he had had to go through Hell to find. So the Divine Comedy is, in part, a poem about a poet becoming ready to write this poem. And Hell is in part a picture of the rottenness and corruption that led to Dante's exile-even the Florentines he admired most in real life, are, Ciacco tells Dante in this canto, utterly cut off from God in eternity, as they were in life. Dante depicts the souls in Hell as able to know the future, but unable to see what is happening in the present in the living world, and so he is able to put in the mouths of the souls in Hell clearer and clearer prophecies of the approaching disaster that will end in his banishment.
",The Inferno
692,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 7,"Summary
	Plutus (in ancient mythology the god of wealth) is a demonic ""cruel beast"" serving Satan, and he must be a horrible sight, since Virgil has to reassure a fearful Dante that Plutus cannot stop them from descending to the next circle. As he has before, Virgil tells Plutus that Dante's descent into Hell is willed in Heaven, and Plutus collapses. They descend to the Fourth Circle, and Dante sees two groups of souls endlessly rolling great stones at each other and taunting each other, one group yelling, ""Why do you hoard?"" and the other, ""Why do you squander?"" Both have given their whole attention to wealth, whether keeping it for themselves or spending it recklessly. Many of the hoarders are former popes and cardinals, Virgil tells Dante, and Dante says he ought to be able to recognize some of them. No, says Virgil, in life they couldn't distinguish what really matters, and now no one can distinguish who they are. Fortune rules who is wealthy and who is poor, but human beings waste their lives in their concern for wealth; not even the greatest wealth could bring them any rest now.
	Dante wants to know who Fortune is, and Virgil pictures her as an angelic intelligence ordained by God to regulate which nations have power and wealth, and for how long. Human beings curse her, but she does not hear them-she blissfully turns her wheel.
	At the edge of this circle they find a gloomy river, which flows into a marsh called Styx. There Dante sees people in rage attacking each other, hitting each other with their hands and bodies and tearing each other with their teeth. Virgil explains that these souls were completely taken over by anger against others while alive. If their anger was directed against themselves, that is, if they were sullen, they are trapped under water, where they say forever, ""We were sullen in the sweet air that rejoices in the sun, carrying within ourselves a sluggish smoke; now we are sullen in the black mire"" (lines 121-124). Virgil and Dante then go around the circle, beside the marsh, to the foot of a tower.
	Analysis
	The Fourth Circle is one of just three in all the circles of Hell in which Dante recognizes no one, so deeply did he feel that a life of concern with getting and spending destroys the soul. What he does recognize is how many leaders of the Church are in this circle; no wonder the world goes wrong, he says later in Purgatory, if those who are supposed to guide us all to the bliss of union with God are themselves obsessed with material things.
	One allegorical meaning that can be seen in the descending levels so far is a kind of psychological analysis of how one problem leads to another. Those who are set on gaining happiness by self-indulgence may begin by having some kind of concern for others, as in the Second Circle, but they are apt to sink into solitary self-indulgence, like the gluttonous in the Third Circle, and then to join together only in hostility, as the hoarders and spenders join to attack each other here in the Fourth Circle. Finally, like the wrathful and sullen in the Stygian marsh, which is also the Fifth Circle, they feel nothing but resentment and rage, whether directed at others or themselves.
	One of the touches that lightens the darkness of the Inferno is the reminder here of the beauty that the angry and sullen have turned their backs on: the beauty of ""the sweet air that rejoices in the sun.""
	Another such touch is the description given here of Fortune. Traditionally, she was pictured as a blind woman turning a wheel-random luck running, often ruining, human lives. Dante had thought that way himself, his life having been, as he felt, so unjustly ruined. But here Fortune is not blind, but a serene and blessed angelic intelligence carrying out God's will on earth.
",The Inferno
693,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 8,"Summary
	When Dante and Virgil come to the foot of the tower, they see two lights shining from it, and another light in the distance flashing in reply. Dante wants to know what's going on, and Virgil points out something coming toward them across the marsh. It's a little boat, and the demon who steers it, Phlegyas, gloats, thinking Dante is an evil soul that has come into his power, then swells with held-in rage when Virgil tells him they are only going to cross. Virgil gets in the boat first, but it is only when Dante gets in that the boat sinks lower in the water.
	As they cross, one of the spirits wallowing in the mire asks Dante who he is. Dante recognizes him and feels no pity: Filippo Argenti is where he belongs. Filippo reaches out toward the boat, but Virgil pushes him away, and blesses Dante for his indignation, saying that this man was utterly arrogant while he lived and is now furious because no good is remembered of him. Many now living who think they are great kings will meet the same fate. Dante wants to see Filippo thrust deeper into the mire, and his wish is fulfilled when the whole crowd of angry souls attack Filippo, and he even attacks himself.
	Now Dante hears more sounds of grief and gazes intently forward. Virgil tells him that they are approaching the mighty city of Dis. Dante sees its mosques, lit by the glow of the eternal fire within. They come to the gates of Dis and get out of the boat, and above the gates they see a host of fallen angels, who say that no living man may enter here. They invite Virgil to come, and tell Dante he must go back alone, if he can. Now Dante is really scared, and he begs Virgil not to go, but Virgil says their entering can't be stopped, and promises not to forsake Dante. He goes to talk to the fallen angels, now devils; Dante can't hear what they're saying, but he sees them slam the gates shut in Virgil's face. Virgil comes back with all his self-confidence gone, but he assures Dante that even now someone is on the way down the steps of Hell to open the gates of the city.
	Analysis
	The way Dante weighs down the boat reminds us-he is a living human being, still in his body, while the others are bodiless shades. He can still choose; he is not stuck. It's interesting that, even in traditions where there's a belief in reincarnation, being in a human body is thought of as giving a unique opportunity for spiritual growth.
	The scene with Filippo Argenti has horrified many readers. What kind of Christianity is this? Could it be, some ask, that Dante the pilgrim is being shown as affected by Hell, taking on the sins he condemns? One answer that has been given is that on the literal level, all the pilgrim's reactions to the souls in Hell are reflections of their own state, as though to underline that they can only have what they chose while they were alive. Allegorically, it's easier-Dante for the first time sees his own tendency to violent, destructive anger and summons up the energy of righteous anger to reject it. As for the political meaning, Filippo was a Florentine, and he was typical of the arrogant and violent aristocrats who were doing Florence so much damage.
	The city of Dis consists of all the rest of Hell: the walls of Dis go all the way around the pit. Only within these walls does the fire of Hell burn. Allegorically, on the personal level, this is the point where Dante must begin to confront, not just his tendencies to give in to lust or anger and so on, but his actual, willed choice to do harm to others and himself, turning his back on the love that he believes has been revealed to him through Christ-and Beatrice. Virgil's help is not enough, when it comes to facing this truth about himself.
	Dante sees the ""mosques"" of the city of Dis. We saw earlier that Dante could revere the valor and wisdom of three great Muslims, Saladin, Avicenna, and Averroes, but here we see that he shared the belief that prevailed in his day, that Islam was a willed, deliberate turning away from the love revealed in Christ, a ""heresy."" From that point of view, mosques are what one would expect to find in the city of Dis.

And if it doesn't . . . . Dante imagines the worst, and asks whether anyone from the First Circle, where Virgil dwells, has ever come down this far. Virgil answers that he himself was once conjured by a witch to go down to the very depth of Hell and bring back a shade, so he does indeed know the way, and Dante shouldn't worry.
	But now Dante sees on the tower before them the three Furies, in the shape of women with snakes for hair, raging and threatening to bring out the gorgon Medusa, whose gaze would turn Dante to stone. Virgil orders Dante to turn around and covers Dante's eyes with his hands, since if Dante were once to see Medusa, he would never return to the light of day.
	Then over the waves comes a fearful sound, as of a mighty wind striking a forest, and Virgil drops his hands and urges Dante to look. Indignant, yet calm and untouched, an angel is crossing the marsh, and he opens the gate easily and reproaches the fallen angels with vainly resisting God's will. Then he goes on his way, and Dante and Virgil enter secure.
	Once inside the gates, Dante sees a great plain covered with tombs, and the tombs are made red hot by the flames that surround them. The lids of the tombs are open, and Dante hears the groans of those within. Virgil explains that they are all heretics.
	Analysis
	Medusa the gorgon is a symbol of despair, and despair can easily seize on those who first realize they have chosen their own misery. A realization of a deeper force that wills growth and joy is needed here.
",The Inferno
695,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 10,"Summary
	Dante wants to know whether it's possible to speak to the souls in the tombs, and Virgil explains that they are now in the section of the Sixth Circle where lie those heretics who believed that the soul dies with the body, and soon his wish will be granted. Farinata, a Florentine of earlier times whom Dante greatly respected, even though he was of a different party, a Ghibelline, rises erect in his tomb, seeming to scorn Hell, and speaks to Dante, asking who his ancestors were. Hearing their names, he says they were his and his party's enemies, and he drove them out twice. Yes, says Dante, but they came back; the Ghibellines haven't learned that art. Just then, the shade beside Farinata rises up, having recognized Dante. If you're allowed to come here because you're such a good poet, why isn't my son Guido Cavalcanti with you? Perhaps your Guido scorned the blessed lady I'm being led toward, answers Dante. Isn't my son still alive, the father cries, and when Dante doesn't immediately answer, he falls back in despair. Farinata ignores him and goes on where they were interrupted. The pain of hearing that the Ghibellines haven't been able to return is, he says, worse than the pain of Hell. But soon Dante will learn how hard it is to learn the art of returning after being banished. After asking Farinata to tell Guido's father that his son is still alive, Dante goes on with Virgil brooding about Farinata's ominous words, and Virgil assures him Beatrice will tell him all his fate. Then they come to the brink of the next level, and a foul stench rises up from it.
	Analysis
	The heretics have all rejected truths Dante believed they really knew deserved to be believed. The example here, of those who deny the immortality of the soul, is a good one-as far as Dante knew, everyone with any claim to wisdom, whether pagan or Christian, had always been sure of the immortality of the soul. The best analogy would be someone who refuses to believe that pollution is a problem, even though he lives in a city where the air is so bad that his asthma tortures him. He's not going to be swept along, just because everyone else believes something.
	Some have thought that Dante really, even if unconsciously, wants us to admire Farinata, to see him as so strong he can scorn Hell. Others point out that he is so ""strong,"" he feels no compassion for the man beside him in the tomb.
",The Inferno
696,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 11,"Summary
	The stench of the next circle is so bad that Dante and Virgil have to wait until they get used to it before they can go on. Virgil uses the time to explain to Dante the plan of the rest of Hell, so that he won't need each circle explained to him-he'll see the souls and their sufferings, and he'll understand. After Virgil has explained, Dante asks how the people outside the wall fit in, and Virgil reproaches him for not remembering his Aristotle (the great authority in philosophy in the Middle Ages) any better than that. Weakness of will is of course a less serious offense than deliberate wrongdoing, but it still offends God.
	Analysis
	The easiest way to get the plan of Hell straight is to make yourself a map that you can keep in front of you, or to consult the maps in one of the editions of Dante. In Outer Hell, as we discussed before, are first the righteous unbaptized, and then those who simply gave in to their impulses, the incontinent. There are five circles in all in Outer Hell: the Second Circle for the lustful, the Third for the gluttonous, the Fourth for the hoarders and spendthrifts, and the Fifth for the wrathful. Within the walls of the city of Dis, which can be seen as symbolizing the hardened will that deliberately chooses to go wrong, are four circles. The Sixth Circle holds the heretics. The Seventh holds those who used violence to do wrong, the Eighth, those who used the divine gift of reason to practice fraud against other human beings in general, and the Ninth, those who used fraud against those they were especially bound to, in other words, the traitors. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circles are all subdivided. The first round of the Seventh Circle holds those who used violence against the lives and property of other human beings, the second, those who used violence against themselves, whether by suicide or by destroying their own property (felt at that time to be an extension of oneself), and the third, those who used violence against God, whether directly, by blaspheming God, or by using violence against God's creation, against the natural order of things, by engaging in usury or sodomy. Each kind of simple fraud, which simply violates the bond of love that naturally unites all human beings, has its own place in the Eighth Circle. In the Ninth Circle, those who violate the special bonds that create a special trust are separated according to the bond they trampled on by their treachery.
",The Inferno
697,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 12,"Summary
	A sheer mountainside leads down to the Seventh Circle; they can only get down it where a landslide has shattered the rocks, but just there stands the Minotaur, half man, half bull. Virgil enrages him by taunting him with his defeat at the hands of Theseus, and they slip by while he writhes in rage. At the foot of the cliff is a river of boiling blood, in which all those who shed the blood of others suffer. Centaurs, half man, half horse, guard the banks, and they courteously help Virgil and Dante. The centaur who goes with them carries Dante on his back, so that he can get across the river, and points out the famous sinners who boil there. Deepest in the river are the tyrants and conquerors, such as Alexander and Attila, and recent tyrants of cities in Italy who had been notorious for their violence.
	Analysis
	Dante does not speak of Alexander as Alexander the Great; the ""glory"" Alexander and his fellow tyrants won is lost in a river of blood, and they are distinguished from murderers and burglars by being plunged deeper in the river. As for the courteous centaurs, it has been suggested that many who at that time made Italy miserable by their violence seemed courteous and noble in person, but in Dante's eyes their violence made them less than human.
",The Inferno
698,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 13,"Summary
	The centaur leaves them on the farther shore of the river of boiling blood, and they set out through a strange, barren woods of trees with dingy leaves and poisonous thorns, where Harpies, half human, half bird, lament. This is the second round, Virgil tells Dante. Dante hears wailing but sees no one and is bewildered. Virgil tells him to break off a twig from one of the trees; immediately blood and a voice come out of the wound, asking why Dante is adding to his torment. The speaker turns out to be a famous statesman and poet named Pier delle Vigne, who had served an emperor and been imprisoned on charges of treachery. He killed himself in despair. Now he explains that he had never betrayed his master, and is glad to think that Dante will tell the truth about him when he returns to the world of living souls. He tells how those who have been violent against their own bodies here become thorn trees, and even at the Last Judgment will not again enter their bodies-only each dead body will be hung on the tree of the soul who threw it away. Then crashing through the woods, wounding all the trees on their way, come two of those here punished for wantonly throwing away all their own goods and destroying their lives that way, pursued by great black hounds who tear them apart.
	Analysis
	Those in this strange and eerie wood re-suffer the violence they inflicted on themselves forever. Much as Dante admired and pitied Pier delle Vigne, he did not feel he could show him as being spared the fate he had chosen when he killed himself, so the story goes, by dashing his head against the wall of his cell.
",The Inferno
699,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 14-15,"Summary
	Dante and Virgil emerge from the wood to see a plain of dry and barren sand, where souls, some lying, some sitting, some continually moving, try in vain to escape an endless rain of flakes of fire. First they hear the proud Capaneus boasting as he lies in torment on the sand that he does not weep to show that Jove cannot subdue him. Virgil tells Capaneus that his pride is in fact the worst part of his punishment. Then they see a great stream coming out of the wood, and Virgil explains that its source is the weeping of a giant Old Man who stands in a mountain in Crete. His head is gold, his chest and arms are silver, the rest of his torso is brass, and his legs are iron, except that one foot is clay. Below the head a crack begins that drips tears, and from those tears come all the rivers that torment the souls in Hell. Dante and Virgil are able to cross the burning sands by staying close to the stream.
	On the way they meet a band of those who are continually moving, among them one Dante knows, Brunetto Latini. Dante greets him with reverence. Brunetto obscurely foretells the perils that are waiting for Dante, and encourages him to scorn those who attack him. Dante speaks of his gratitude to Brunetto for teaching him the way to immortal fame. Brunetto must leave to rejoin the group he is with, and Dante sees him run ahead, and thinks he looks like a winning runner.
	Analysis
	One blasphemer speaks for all, in Capaneus. To reject and defy the supreme power in the universe, however one conceives of it, may sound impressive, but it is absurd. The Old Man of Crete embodies the tragedy of human history, his head of gold symbolizing the world before the Fall, his foot of clay the corrupt papacy of Dante's own day. Those who move around on the sand are the sodomites, and here again Dante the narrator shows Dante the pilgrim respecting deeply someone whose corruption is indicated by his place in Hell. Dante shares the beliefs of his age about the order of nature as created by God and sinned against by those who engage in a kind of sexuality that cannot lead to the conception of a child. The sterility of all kinds of violence against God and nature is imaged in the burning sand.
",The Inferno
700,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 16-17,"Summary
	Three Florentines call out to Dante to wait until they can catch up with him, and Virgil says he must be courteous to them. And indeed, once Dante learns their names, he wishes he could come down where they are and embrace them. Only his fear of being burned and baked stops him. They fear he will despise them, but Dante says he feels only grief for them, and that all his life he has admired them for their good deeds in Florence. They want to know if there is any courtesy and valor left in Florence, and Dante cries out that the recent new wealth in Florence has created such arrogance, such excess, that Florence is already weeping. They leave, asking only that he should speak of them when he ""returns to see the beautiful stars"" (line 83), and Virgil and Dante go on to another precipice, down which a might river pours. Dante is wearing a cord, with which he had once hoped to catch the Leopard (of Canto 1), and Virgil throws it down into the abyss. Dante warns us he's about to tell us something incredible: He sees through the murky air a strange and terrifying figure come swimming up.
	Virgil announces him as Fraud, the beast that corrupts the world. His face looks an honest man's, he has the body of a serpent, and at the end of his tail is a poisonous sting. As they go toward the beast, whose name is Geryon, Dante sees a group of people sitting on the sand, and Virgil sends him to look at them while Virgil talks to Geryon, so that he will carry them down into the abyss. The usurers sit there on the burning sand, trying to brush away the falling flakes of flame. Dante does not recognize their faces, but each one has a purse hung round his neck at which he is staring, and on each purse is the coat of arms of a well-known Florentine family. Dante speaks to no one. When he comes back, Virgil is already mounted on Geryon. Dante trembles all over when told to climb on, but for shame he does so, though he is too scared to bring out the words to ask Virgil to hang onto him well. But Virgil does hold onto him, as he has before, and orders Geryon to fly down slowly, with this unusual burden on him. Down circling and circling through the dark air they go, until finally Dante sees such fires and hears such wailing that he shrinks back in fear. Geryon sets them down and quickly flies out of sight.
	Analysis
	Dante clearly despises most those who care only for money and who exploit others to get it, especially when, as aristocrats, they should be noble leaders. They are very near the abyss of fraud. Still, theirs is still basically a sin of violence, in this case against the natural order that rewards real work with money. They simply manipulate money to make money, and the teaching of the Church in Dante's day was that that was a sin. Deliberate, willed fraud is far, far lower than any of the sins of violence. That depth is perfectly conveyed in the long, slow, wheeling flight of Geryon down into the abyss.
",The Inferno
701,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 18,"Summary
	Dante tells us the shape of the Eighth Circle; he calls it Malebolge, evil pouches. Each ""pouch,"" or bolgia, goes all the way around the yet deeper pit that yawns in the center, and each one holds a different kind of sinner. Dante and Virgil cross each bolgia by a spur of rock that forms a bridge over it. Around the bottom of the First Pouch, lashed by horned demons, go the panders and seducers. Among the panders in the First Bolgia is someone Dante recognizes who confesses that is true that he made his sister sleep with a powerful nobleman, and among the seducers is Jason, the ""hero"" who brought back the Golden Fleece to Greece, using and leaving several women in the process. In the Second Bolgia, plunged in what looks and smells like excrement from human outhouses, are the flatterers.
	Analysis
	No one in either of these bolgias asks to be remembered when Dante returns to the world; their sins, which involve either betraying innocent women or using the uniquely human gift of speech to manipulate rather than to tell the truth, are too vile. Dante and Virgil do not linger.
",The Inferno
702,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 19,"Summary
	Dante begins by an outburst against Simon Magus and those who imitate him, buying or selling holy things. Their place is in the Third Bolgia, where they are planted upside down in fiery holes, with only their lower legs and feet, whose soles are licked by flame, sticking out. Dante delights in the perfection of this punishment. He speaks to one of the souls, and it answers, ""Boniface, are you already here?"" Dante quickly denies that he is Boniface, and the shade tells its story. In life, he was a pope who cared only to make money out of his office, and Boniface is going to be thrust into this hole on top of him, driving him deeper down, and then not long after another pope will arrive who has been even worse. Dante speaks with bitter sarcasm-how much money did Christ ask from St. Peter before he gave him the keys? And he tells the pope he would speak even more harshly if he did not reverence the office of pope, since the avarice of the popes and other churchmen who worship gold and silver rather than God has filled the whole world with evil. Virgil looks pleased with Dante for speaking the truth.
	Analysis
	This sin, called simony from Simon Magus, the magician who tried to buy spiritual power from Peter, according to the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, demands Dante's full attention, his full indignation. These men, who should be leading others to Heaven, have put earth above Heaven; no wonder they are upside down.
	This is the only time Boniface VIII's name is actually mentioned in Hell; it's a perfect touch that it is spoken by one of the damned, with a clear prophecy that Boniface will soon be arriving.
",The Inferno
703,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 20,"Summary
	In the Fourth Bolgia, Dante sees those who used magic arts, especially the diviners, who foretold the future, moving endlessly around weeping with their heads set backwards on their bodies. Dante weeps for pity to see the human form so distorted, but Virgil rebukes him for grieving at the carrying out of God's justice, and urges him to look, as he points out all the famous prophets from classical myth and history-they tried to look too far ahead, and now they must look only behind. One of the ancient diviners is the woman for whom Mantua, Virgil's native city, was named, and Virgil tells the true story of her role in its founding. Virgil ends by pointing out some famous medieval wizards and fortune-tellers, as well as a crowd of ordinary women who cast spells and told fortunes.
	Analysis
	In her edition of the Inferno, Dorothy Sayers interprets the basic sin described in this canto as trying to manipulate the material world in the service of the ego. Another way of seeing it is as an obsession with trying to know the future as a way of giving the ego an illusion of knowledge and control. Other interpreters point out how much deception and trickery was involved in the kinds of attempts to know the future that were popular in Dante's time-and perhaps not only then?
",The Inferno
704,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 21-22,"Summary
	In the Fifth Bolgia, Dante sees boiling pitch. Dante looks at it so intently that he doesn't see the black devil coming toward them, and Virgil has to call a warning and pull Dante toward him. The devil is carrying a town official from Lucca, and calls out to another devil to throw the official into the pitch, while he goes back for more: they are all grafters there. Virgil tells Dante to hide, and goes out across the bridge to deal with the demons. They want to attack, but when the leader hears that his and Dante's journey is divinely willed, he orders the rest to let them pass. Virgil calls out to Dante to come, telling him he's safe, but Dante has his doubts. For good reason. They all have hooks, which they use to catch sinners and plunge them deeper into the pitch, and as Dante goes by, one wants to give Dante a little jab on his butt, and another cheers him on. The leader restrains them, and tells Virgil that here the bridge over the next bolgia is broken, but there's another unbroken bridge, and he'll send an escort of devils along to take them to it. Dante begs Virgil not to accept the escort-he'd feel much safer with just Virgil, given the way the devils are looking at him, but Virgil tells him they're just glaring at the souls in the pitch, and he should have no fear. So the group sets out, each devil saluting the captain by sticking out his tongue; he acknowledges their salutes by making a trumpet of his ass.
	Dante has seen many military maneuvers, he tells us, and heard all sorts of signals, but never from a trumpet like that! As they move on with their strange escort, Dante keeps his eyes on the pitch. Occasionally he sees the back of a sinner who has jumped out of the pitch like a dolphin for some relief from the pitch, and then he sees a group of sinners lying half out with their heads on the bank. One doesn't get back in quickly enough and is caught by one of the devils. They are about to rip him apart, but they allow Virgil to question him first, to satisfy Dante's curiosity about who he is and who his companions are. He answers at great length, naming several famous grafters in high position. He then offers to bring some Florentines for Dante to talk to. If the devils will just draw back out of sight, he'll whistle, the signal the souls here use to let each other know when the coast is clear. The devils are suspicious, but he convinces them he just wants to have the fun of getting his friends in trouble, and they withdraw. Instantly he dives, pursued in vain by the devil who decided for trusting him, and then another devil in rage flies after the first, attacks him, and they both end up in the pitch. While the others are trying to get them out, Dante and Virgil move on.
	Analysis
	Since Dante was accused of graft (or barratry, to use the more technical term) by the Blacks who took over Florence, condemning him to banishment on pain of death when he did not come back to stand trial, these cantos are generally interpreted as a farcical account of the way Dante's accusers tried to destroy him by getting him to come back to Florence and stand trial, and then tried to destroy his good name. Certainly these two cantos are grimly humorous, and they suggest Dante's contempt for those who go in for subsurface dealings. Also, if Virgil on one level stands for Dante's conscience, then it makes sense that Virgil would have been convinced that Dante was in no danger-after all, he was innocent-but a clear conscience isn't always enough. Sometimes one has to run.
",The Inferno
705,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 23,"Summary
	At first Dante and Virgil go on quietly, presumably hoping to get to the bridge over the next bolgia (the sixth) that the chief devil had told them was unbroken. But then Dante starts thinking about how the devils are going to be feeling after being fooled and humiliated, and suggests they hide. Virgil has already seen what he's thinking and totally agrees, but before they can do anything, they see the devils flying after them. Then, as a mother wakes up to see flames threatening and picks up her child and runs, not waiting to put on any clothes, so Virgil picks up Dante and slides down the bank into the next bolgia. There they are safe, since no devil can leave the bolgia to which it has been assigned. In this ditch they find people walking around the circle very slowly, wearing cloaks and hoods of the kinds monks wear. These garments are gilded and bright on the outside, but made of lead and unbearably heavy. ""O weary mantle for eternity!"" (line 68). The sinners Dante talks to tell him that all these souls were hypocrites; they themselves had been appointed joint rulers of Florence to bring about peace, but had actually been corrupt and caused destruction. Stretched across the path of the hypocrites (so that each must walk on him) and crucified with three stakes is Caiaphas, the high priest who contributed to the crucifixion of Christ by arguing that it was expedient for one man to be executed for the sake of the people.
	Virgil asks if there is any place where it's easy to climb out of the ditch, and is told that the next bridge is broken in such a way that they can climb up on its ruins. That is the bridge that the chief of the devils had said they could cross by, and Virgil is so upset at finding out he's been lied to he moves ahead quickly, and Dante follows, in the track of ""the print of the dear feet"" (line 148).
	Analysis
	Virgil is usually so dignified, but here he puts all his dignity aside to save Dante. Some see here how completely Dante had to commit himself to his conscience to escape the charge against him; others emphasize that this touch that brings out Virgil's full humanity. The human beings in Dante's work may stand for something more than themselves, but part of what makes the Inferno a great poem is the full human relationship between Dante and Virgil, so different from the ""relationships"" between the souls they meet.
	If you have ever deliberately tried to appear to be something you weren't for a prolonged period of time in order to get what you wanted, you may have some idea how perfectly this punishment reveals not only the essence of the sin, but at least one aspect of the price one pays for it. What a burden!
",The Inferno
706,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 24-25,"Canto 24-25
Summary
	Dante is deeply discouraged by seeing Virgil so upset, but Virgil recovers as soon as they reach the place where they have to climb, and turns to Dante ""with that sweet look that I first saw at the foot of the mountain"" (lines 20-21), back in the Dark Wood. Once again he picks Dante up and lifts him high enough that he can climb on his own, with Virgil's help. It's the hardest climb they've had yet, and Dante sits down exhausted at the top, but Virgil urges him on. Sloth won't win him fame. And Dante pulls himself together and goes on.
	They go over the next high, narrow bridge, but can only see the souls down in the ditch (the Seventh Bolgia) when they come to the other side. There they see shades tormented by serpents. As they watch, one soul is bitten by a serpent, dissolves into ash, and then re-forms. It turns out to be a notorious plunderer and thief named Vanni Fucci, who is so ashamed to have Dante see him here that he foretells the coming victory of the Blacks in Florence, just to wound Dante.
	When he has finished speaking, the thief lifts up both his hands in the obscene gesture called the fig (the fingers in a fist, the thumb thrust through between the index and second finger), defying God. Two serpents choke him and bind his hands, and he goes off. A centaur named Cacus, known for his thievery, pursues him. Three more spirits come in sight, and Dante and Virgil watch as they change shapes with each other, one becoming a serpent.
	Analysis
	Subtle thieves, who operate by deception, are worse in Dante's scheme of things that open robbers, and they are aptly tormented by creeping serpents. As they did not allow others to call their property their own, so now they cannot call their bodies their own.
	The absurdity of the pride that resists and defies God, who is Reality itself, becomes more and more obvious. Farinata one can see as noble; Capaneus is, as Virgil points out, torturing himself with his defiance; and what could be more ludicrous than making an obscene gesture at God?
",The Inferno
707,The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 26,"Canto 26
Summary
	Dante the narrator begins the canto by making a little speech to Florence, telling her to rejoice, since no less than five of the thieves he has just met are prominent Florentines. But great disaster is coming toward her, and he hopes it will come soon, since it must come, because it will only bring him more pain later.
	Dante and Virgil move on, Virgil helping Dante with the hard ascent of the next bridge. Remembering what he saw then (in the Eighth Bolgia), Dante the narrator says he still grieves over it, and feels fresh resolve not to misuse the powers he has been given. What Dante see are tongues of flame, as many as fireflies on a summer night, and Virgil tells him that within each is a tormented spirit, and within one flame whose top is split are two spirits, Ulysses (Odysseus) and Diomedes, who advised the Greeks to deceive the Trojans with the Trojan Horse. At Dante's urgent request, Virgil conjures Ulysses to speak and tell where he went on his last voyage and how he died. Ulysses tells how, hungry always for new experience, he did not go back to his wife and son and kingdom after he left Circe but on to the Pillars of Hercules. There he persuaded his men to sail on into the open Atlantic, telling them ""You were not born to live like beasts, but to follow virtue and knowledge"" (lines 119-120), and to have as full an experience of the world as possible before your brief life ends. Ulysses goes on to tell how they sailed on their crazy journey for many days, until finally they saw a mountain rising out of the sea. From that mountain a storm rose and sank their ship.
	Analysis
	In the Eighth Bolgia are those who used their high gifts of intelligence and eloquence to persuade other to commit fraud, stealing their integrity as here the flame steals the form of the sinner. Ulysses was not nearly as much of a hero in medieval versions of the story of Troy as he was in Homer, whom Dante could not read, knowing no Greek. Nevertheless, many have felt that he is presented as truly heroic here, in a version of his story that is Dante's original creation. Certainly the speech Ulysses makes is one of the best-known passages of the poem. Those who see Ulysses as heroic believe that Dante sympathized with his aspiration for full experience and knowledge, even though, given the theology of Dante's day, Ulysses had to be condemned. Others have argued that, splendid as the rhetoric of the speech may be, Ulysses himself calls his journey crazy, and to make it he has to turn his back on all his human ties.

Summary
	Recognizing him as Italian, a soul, by moving the tip of its tongue of flame asks Dante to tell him the state of things in Romagna, from which he comes. Dante tells him of endless warfare between the nobles there, and begs to know his name. The soul answers, ""If I believed my answer were to someone who would ever return to the world, this flame would remain still. But since never from this depth has anyone returned alive, if I hear true, without fear of infamy I answer you"" (lines 61-66). Still, he does not say his name (Guido da Montefeltro), but simply tells his story. While he was young, he played the fox, and was famous for his knowledge of all the tricks and deceptions that are effective in the world. As he got older, he repented and became a Franciscan friar, and that would have meant his salvation, if Pope Boniface VIII hadn't sent for him to ask his advice on how to get the best of an Italian family he was feuding with. When Guido didn't answer, Boniface absolved him ahead of time for any sin, boasting of his power as pope to control who would get into Heaven. Guido advised him to promise and then break his promise. When Guido died, St. Francis came for him, but a devil got in first and claimed him, pointing out that absolution does no good without repentance first, and it's obvious one hasn't repented if one goes ahead and does the deed.
	Analysis
	The passage quoted above was used by T.S. Eliot as the epigraph for The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. It illustrates here how deep the infamy of these souls is. ""Politics as usual"" was no excuse in Dante's eyes for this misuse of human intelligence. The advice Guido da Montefeltro gave was that the pope should promise to spare the city he was fighting if they surrendered, and then should go ahead and destroy the city. Boniface did just that.

Summary
	In the Ninth Bolgia, Dante is horrified to see more blood and wounds than were ever created by the worst slaughter of ancient or recent times. The first of the souls who suffer there is Mahomet (Mohammed), whose whole body is sliced almost in two; he explains that all the souls here in their lives created divisions, and so here they are wounded by a devil. The wounds have closed by the time they get around the circle again, and the devil wounds them again. Two of the souls he speaks to here tells of someone living who will soon be here. One with his hands cut off confesses himself to be the man who urged on the murder that started the feuding of Guelph and Ghibelline in Florence. Finally, most unbelievable horror, the poet who encouraged a young prince to rebel against his father walks carrying his own head like a lantern. He holds his head up to speak to them, confessing his deed and the appropriateness of his suffering.
	Analysis
	Mohammed was believed by medieval Christians to have been Christian himself and then to have turned against the Church, leading to all the warfare of the Muslim conquest of North Africa and Spain, and then of the Crusades, just ending in complete defeat for the Christian side in Dante's day. These are the sowers of discord where there should have been harmony and unity; they have used their (often great) gifts of intelligence and persuasion in a way that has disrupted the natural (and therefore divine) order of things and led to endless wounds and blood.

Summary
	Dante is so overwhelmed by the evil here that he just wants to stay and weep, but Virgil urges him on-they must finish their journey through Hell this day. Dante explains that he is lingering because he thinks he sees one of his kinsmen, but Virgil urges him to forget the man-he is here, and he is here justly, and he feels only anger at Dante (who explains that his kinsman is angry because his murder has not been avenged). Dante and Virgil go on to the Tenth (and last) Bolgia, which is full of people suffering from loathsome diseases such as leprosy and of the smell of rotting flesh. Here the counterfeiters, or falsifiers, of every kind suffer. Dante speaks to two Italians who were alchemists; they confess their systematic deception of those who believed they could turn other metals into gold because they knew so well how to counterfeit gold.
	Analysis
	For Dante to linger here would be to risk becoming part of the problem, if he accepted the hideous custom that created so much strife in Italy of private vengeance and endless feud. Think of the Montagues and the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet. On a more universal level, to linger over evil and be devastated by it serves no purpose. As Virgil always urges Dante, see each sin for what it is and move on!
	In the Tenth Bolgia is an image of a completely sick society, where people who think only of gain create imitations of reality in order to deceive, rather than creating anything real. One commentator has wondered what Dante would have thought of the advertising business.

Summary
	Still in the Tenth Bolgia, Dante sees two shades running among the others and biting them cruelly. One in Dante's own day impersonated a dead man and made a will favorable to the man's son, and himself. The other, according to the story in Ovid, was overwhelmed by a passion for her own father, and impersonated another woman in order to sleep with him. The only person Dante speaks to here is Master Adam, who lies helpless and swollen with dropsy, yearning for just one drop of water-but yearning even more to torment those who persuaded him to take up counterfeiting the currency of Florence. Master Adam tells Dante the names of those who lie silently burning in fever near him, and one of them strikes him. Master Adam strikes back, and each one taunts the other with his crimes, while Dante listens, fascinated. Then Virgil reproaches him, and he is filled with such shame that Virgil instantly forgives him, urging him to remember that Virgil is with him if he should ever again be tempted to listen, fascinated, to such quarreling.
	Analysis
	One canto is not enough to portray this sickness, which completes the picture of the moral destruction of an individual or a society guilty of the kind of fraud that violates the bond of love that naturally unites all human beings. With this canto, the Eighth Circle ends. Here Dante the narrator portrays those who have betrayed the trust of others by falsifying and finding their only satisfaction in attacking each other. Here again Dante lingers, but this time Virgil is angry. To take delight in hearing people attack each other is very close to joining in the attack oneself. One can see from this canto why some commentators speak of Virgil as symbolizing Dante's conscience.

Summary
	Healed by Virgil's forgiveness, Dante moves on with him, moving up the bank out of the Tenth Bolgia and on into the darkness. Dante can see little, but he hears the blast of a horn and, looking toward its source, thinks he sees towers. Virgil warns him that these shapes are not towers but giants, each standing around the edge of the deepest pit of Hell, but so huge that they tower up out of the pit. As Dante sees them more clearly, he is filled with fear, but in fact they are no threat to him. The first is Nimrod, who (according to the Book of Genesis) built the Tower of Babel in a proud and defiant attempt to reach Heaven and so caused the one language human beings had spoken up to that time to be lost. He can only babble meaninglessly. Next comes one of the giants who tried to unseat Jove, and he is bound. Finally they come to Antaeus, an old antagonist of Hercules, who can speak and is not bound, and he is easily flattered into setting them down at the bottom of the pit. Virgil holds Dante fast, but Dante is still pretty terrified when he sees Antaeus bend his vast shape toward them-Dante would have preferred another road. But Antaeus sets them down safely.
	Analysis
	This canto is almost comic relief, after the ugliness of the ten bolgias of Malebolge, the Eighth Circle. Yet the likeness of the giants to towers was perhaps meant to suggest the towers from which so many aristocrats afflicted the countryside in Italy, towers that were to Dante emblems of humanity destroyed by pride and violence and brute force ruling. Certainly they could be seen as symbols of the forces that run the world when the bond of love that by nature should rule in human hearts is destroyed.

Summary
	Dante has no rhymes harsh and grating enough to speak of the bottom of the universe, the place where the two poets find themselves now. It is a completely frozen lake, and as they cross it they see the heads of those most famous for betraying their kin. They are frozen in the ice forever, and their only desire is to make others suffer. This first part of the frozen lake is called Caina, after Cain, who slew his brother. Shivering in the eternal cold, they move on into the second part, Antenora, named for the Trojan believed in the Middle Ages to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks. In the darkness, Dante accidentally kicks the face of one of the sinners, and when the man refuses to tell his name, Dante seizes him by the hair and pulls out clumps, until someone nearby says the man's name, and Dante has his suspicion confirmed that this is the man who betrayed the Guelphs at a great battle. Next Dante sees two souls packed in one hole. One of them is gnawing the other's head. Dante asks to hear their story, promising to make the deed for which the gnawer seeks revenge known in the world above.
	Having ""lifted his mouth from his savage meal"" (line 1), the sinner consents to relive the horror of what happened by telling it, for the sake of revenge. He was Count Ugolino, and his victim is Archbishop Ruggieri. Ugolino trusted Ruggieri, and, together with his sons, was captured by him. That part of the story Ugolino doesn't need to dwell on. It had happened recently, and Dante and his audience knew it well. But exactly how he died he will tell. He and his sons were shut in a tower, and one morning after an ominous dream they heard, at the time when food had usually been brought to them, the door of the tower being nailed up. He couldn't weep, but his children did. After two days, he bit his hands for grief, and the youngest son, ""my little Anselm"" (line 50), thinking he was biting his hands for hunger, urged him to eat them. He kept himself calm after that, so as not to add to their grief, and all stayed silent for two more days. Then the first son, asking his father why he couldn't help him, died, and so, one by one, did the others. He, now blind, for two days called their names. ""Then, more than sorrow, hunger had power"" (line 75). Having told his story, Ugolino goes back to gnawing his enemy's skull. Dante the narrator, having recorded the story, bursts forth in reproaches on Pisa, the city that allowed Rugierri to punish innocent children so cruelly.
	The poets move on to the region where those who betray guests lie with faces turned up. Because the tears they weep form pools and freeze over their eyes, they become unable to either weep or see. Dante's face is so numb he can hardly feel, but he does feel a wind, and asks what can possibly be causing it, down here where there are no variations of heat and cold. Virgil replies that he will soon see the cause.
	One of the traitors in this area asks Dante to remove the ice from his eyes, so that he can give some vent to his misery. Dante replies that the sinner must tell Dante his name, and then may Dante have to go to the bottom of the ice if he doesn't help him. Dante is surprised to hear someone named he had thought was still alive, a friar named Alberigo, who had invited his brother and the brother's son to a feast and then murdered them. Alberigo tells him that this area, called Ptolomea (from a Ptolemy who invited his father-in-law to a banquet and then murdered him), has the unique privilege of receiving souls whose bodies are still alive. Such a soul, as soon as it has committed its treachery, falls straight into the ice, and a devil takes its place in the living body.
	Having answered all Dante's questions, Alberigo asks to have his eyes opened. Dante does not keep his promise, ""and it was courtesy to be rude to him"" (line 150).
	Analysis
	No one before Dante had given such a detailed description of Hell, so full of meaning; perhaps his most brilliant stroke was to make the bottom of Hell ice instead of fire. In many ways all along he has been telling us that choosing to try to be happy by going against the divine order of the universe and hurting oneself and others actually means moving away from life and love, from everything that really makes us happy. Ice is a perfect symbol for the hardening that comes with the complete rejection of life and love seen when people betray those they are most closely bound to, whether by the ties of kinship and country, into which they are born, or by offering them hospitality. Guests are seen as sacred in every traditional society. And how horrible to think that treachery as deep as that to a guest could even have such a profound effect on the soul that one would no longer be able to repent. All the sinners seen up till now could, according to the teaching of the Church accepted by Dante, have repented and turned to God, even at the last second of their lives, and no matter how horrible their sins, they would have been forgiven. They would have had some work to do in Purgatory to get rid of the effects of their sins on their souls, but in the end they would have entered Heaven. But here Dante suggests that it is possible to lose the ability to repent. Whether we accept Dante's theology or not, perhaps we can think of people so lost in egotism and hate, so unable to feel for anyone else, that they seem utterly frozen and cut off from ordinary human life.
	The two instances of Dante's cruelty to sinners in these two cantos has led once again to the question of whether he is being shown as affected by the sins he condemns. In this case, has he been frozen by the winds of Hell and lost the ability to pity these souls so completely that he even adds to their suffering? And again, the answer that has been given is that those who have rejected life and love cannot in any meaningful way be treated kindly-from Dante, as from the universe, they get what they have chosen.
	Certainly the story of Ugolino shows how deep was Dante's pity for the suffering of the innocent. It is the longest story in the Inferno, and it is the saddest, whether one interprets its last line, ""Then, more than sorrow, hunger had power"" (line 75), as meaning that Ugolino died too or that he ate the bodies of his children. Dante tells the story in a way that seems to be deliberately meant to make us remember the story of Paolo and Francesca in Canto 5, and it is fascinating to see the similarities and differences between the two stories. Just to take the most striking contrast, instead of the ""love"" that unites Paolo and Francesca, here Ugolino and Ruggiero are united by hatred, so closely that the one gnaws on the other.

Summary
	Now in the deepest depth of Hell, the lowest point in the whole universe, Virgil announces to Dante that he is about to see the being who is the king of Hell. Dante looks through the gloom and sees something that looks like a huge windmill in the distance. Certainly the wind is strong, and he has to shelter himself behind Virgil. In the icy plain beneath them the souls are now completely buried in the ice, through which he sees them. When they get closer, Virgil makes Dante come out from behind him and stop and look at Satan. Dante is so frozen and weak he feels neither dead nor alive, but he looks. There stands the being who was once the fairest angel in Heaven, Lucifer, who rebelled against the Creator who had made him so fair. Utterly ugly now, he is as much bigger than the giants Dante saw at the outer edge of the deepest pits as those giants were bigger than Dante. His head has three faces, one red, one white and yellow, one black. Two great bat wings sprout under each face, and it is the flapping of those wings that freezes the ice of Cocytus. He weeps tears and blood from each of his six eyes, and in each mouth he chews on a sinner. Virgil explains that the one suffering most is Judas Iscariot, and the other two are Brutus and Cassius. Now, having seen everything, they must go.
	Dante holds tight to Virgil, with his arms around Virgil's neck, and Virgil goes right up to Satan and takes hold of his flanks, which are covered with tufts of hair. From tuft to tuft he descends to the midpoint of Satan's body, and then manages to turn himself upside down and start climbing. They reach a cleft in the rock and there Virgil puts Dante down on the edge. Dante looks back, and there are Lucifer's legs upside down. Dante is utterly bewildered. Virgil explains that the midpoint of Satan's body is the center of gravity of the earth, and so at that point Virgil had to turn himself around and start climbing. Now they have a long climb to make through a hollow in the rock made by a river. It takes them a whole day; in the end, Dante says, ""We came out from there to see again the stars"" (line 139).
	Analysis
	No one else has ever shown Satan like this-not full of energy and wit and power, but trapped forever in the negation of life that results from turning against the source of life. Every detail of the description is full of meaning. The hardest part for a modern reader is the suffering of Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar. Influenced by Shakespeare and by modern democratic ideals, we tend to see at least Brutus as a hero, but Dante saw him, not only as a man who treacherously turned on his friend and leader instead of opposing him openly, but as having betrayed, in Caesar, the man who was in effect the first ruler of the Roman Empire, which Dante believed was ordained by God to bring peace to the earth.
	The way Dante and Virgil get out of Hell has a much more universal meaning, one that seems brilliant, even to those who share none of Dante's beliefs. In a way it sums up the whole of the poem. The only sure way out of Hell is by seeing Hell for what it is. To escape from the negation of life represented by Satan, we must use Satan. And once we have finally and completely gotten over the idea that there is anything appealing about the kind of turning against life and love that Satan embodies, we also see how powerless, meaningless, even absurd that rejection is. The last view of Satan is of two hairy legs upside down in the darkness.
	The last line of the Inferno, ""We came out from there to see again the stars,"" beautiful as it is in itself, after the dark stench and paralysis of Hell, is even more full of meaning for Dante than it can be for us. The earth is the center of Dante's universe, and that means that it is the lowest point. Only here does sin have any power. Beyond the circle that the moon makes around the earth, all is order and beauty, and the stars are obviously and always moving in an ordered dance. The Purgatorio ends with the line, ""Pure and prepared to leap up to the stars,"" and the Paradiso ends with the will of the pilgrim Dante completely one with ""The love that moves the sun and the other stars.""

733,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"
	A short prologue begins the story. In it the narrator states that the story of the pearl has been worn to its essence by many retellings in the town from which it originated. As such, things in the story will be black and white, more purely evil and good than as in life. The narrator speculates that if the story is a parable then perhaps the reader will find some lesson for his or her own life.
	The novel opens just before dawn in the coastal village of La Paz on the Gulf of Mexico. Kino awakens just as the morning light is coming into the sky. The roosters, pigs and wild birds are already awake in the yard outside Kino's thatch hut. The first thing Kino sees upon opening his eyes is the light outlining the door to his hut and then he sees the hanging box where his infant son, Coyotito, sleeps. Next he looks at his wife Juana beside him on the mat. Her eyes, as they always are when Kino awakes, are already open. Most of her head is covered in a blue shawl that she uses to ward off the chill of night. She is looking at him.
	Kino hears the music of the waves upon the shore. We learn that in the past everything Kino's people did or saw became a song but that time has long since passed and no new songs have been created. Kino, however, has his personal song that is ""clear and soft"" that, if he chose to give it a name, would be called ""The Song of the Family.""
	Juana rises and, after checking to see that Coyotito is well, fans an ember from the firepit into the morning cooking fire. Kino, meanwhile, puts on his sandals and steps outside the hut to watch the dawn. A goat approaches him and a moth flies into the light of the fire. Kino now hears the song of the family coming from the stone where Juana is grinding the corn for the morning meal. The dawn comes suddenly while Kino watches ""with the detachment of God"" a group of ants in the sand. When a thin timid dog approaches Kino offers it a kind word and the dog rests contentedly near him.
	The narrator interjects that though this morning is like any other, it is perfect in its way. From the hut Kino can hear the sound of Juana singing an ancient song that forms part of the song of the family. Though the melody consists of only three notes the song is part of Kino's life and for him evokes feelings of safety and warmth. From other brush houses Kino hears other families rising with their own songs.
	Kino is young with black hair, brown skin and a thin mustache and warm but fierce eyes. Before he steps inside Kino see two inept roosters preparing for a fight in the yard and a covey of wild doves flying inland to the hills. Inside Juana has finished preparing the corn cakes and is braiding her hair. Kino eats hot corn cakes and drinks some pulque that, except for rare occasions, has always been his morning meal. Kino's sigh of satisfaction after he has eaten is all the conversation necessary for Juana and Kino to begin their day.
	The rising sun streams through the crack in the brush house and Kino and Juana's attention is suddenly drawn to a deadly scorpion descending one of the ropes supporting Coyotito's hanging box. The scorpion brings to Kino's mind the song of evil, brought by any enemy of the family, and as the scorpion draws closer to the happily gurgling infant Juana begins to recite both pagan and Christian prayers of protection. Kino slowly approaches the deadly creature but Coyotito's laughter causes the rope to shake and the scorpion falls onto the boys' shoulder. The scorpion stings Coyotito before Kino can pull it away and stamp it to death on the earth floor.
	Juana pulls the baby from the crib and immediately begins to suck the poison from the wound. The neighbors, including Kino's older brother Juan Thom�s and his wife Apolonia, come rushing at the sound of the screaming child. Everyone knows that though Juana has done her best to remove the poison there is a good chance the baby will die if enough of the venom remains. After the sickness begins the baby will suffer terribly until he dies. Juana demands that Kino bring the doctor to treat Coyotito.
	Everyone gathered at Kino's hut knows that it would be very surprising if the doctor came since he never came to the poor indian's huts. After Kino tells his wife that the doctor will not come, she responds that they must go to him. With his son's life at stake Kino agrees. Everyone follows Kino and Juana to the doctor's house. They take the path to where the stone portion of the city begins, where the walled houses hold cool inner gardens with caged birds and splashing fountains. As they proceed to the doctor's home, new people join the procession including four beggars normally posted outside the church who know everything that happens in the town. The beggars know that the doctor, who thinks of the indians as animals, will not deign to treat Kino's son.
	At the gate to the doctor's house Kino hesitates when he considers that the doctor is the descendent a people that for four hundred years had subjugated his own. Kino feels weak, afraid and angry. Kino hears the music of the enemy in his ears. Even though the rage and terror grow within him, Kino thinks to remove his hat before lifting the iron knocker on the gate. The servant who comes to the door is an indian of Kino's own race and Kino says in their common language that his child is sick and needs a healer. The servant, refusing to use the indian language, tells Kino that he will inform the doctor of the reason for their visit and then he shuts the gate.
	The doctor is languishing in his sumptuous bedchamber, drinking chocolate and, as he often does, thinking of the time that he spent in Paris as a young man when he could afford a mistress and still have the small luxuries of life. Dressed in a silk robe, the doctor drinks from a cup of china that is so small that he must use only the tip of his thumb and forefinger to lift it. He is fat and his voice has become hoarse. On the walls are various religious pictures including one in the same style depicting his deceased wife. When the servant informs the doctor of Kino's request, the doctor contemptuously asks if the indians have any money to pay for his services. The servant returns to Kino who produces several small, misshapen pearls of little value. After a time the servant returns the pearls to Kino and makes the excuse that the doctor has gone out to treat a serious case.
	The group waiting with Kino quickly dissolves because they do not want to witness his shame. Kino stands at the doctor's shut gate in silence for a time and then, after replacing his hat on his head, suddenly strikes the iron gate with his fist which causes his knuckles to begin bleeding.
	Analysis
	The novel is set in the town of La Paz, which Steinbeck visited in the course of a biological expedition with his scientist friend Ed Ricketts. The oyster beds of La Paz produced many of the pearls that had fueled the Spanish conquest of the region during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. While in La Paz, Steinbeck heard the story of a young indian who found a valuable pearl and hid it under a rock. After he was nearly killed by robbers the young indian threw the pearl back into the sea. Inspired by the tale, Steinbeck wrote his own version of the story which was initially published in Woman's Home Companion (December, 1945) as ""The Pearl of The World"". The story was first published as a book in 1947 to coincide with the release of the movie version.
	The first chapter begins with a series of descriptions -- Kino and Juana awaking, the simple but comforting disposition of their brush house, and the activities of the various animals Kino observes outside his hut. We learn that Kino is sensitive to the small details of his world and that these things all form a part of the security and comfort embodied in Kino's song of the family. When the narrator observes that ""it was a morning like other morning and yet perfect among mornings"" we can infer that Kino's life is being presented in the manner of a parable in which people and events are portrayed as sharply delineated between good and evil so that the reader can draw the narrator's intended lesson.
	The scorpion evokes the song of evil, which Kino hears whenever an enemy of the family threatens. The episode with the scorpion makes that morning different from those that preceded it and precipitates the need for a visit to the doctor's house. This in turn leads to a sharp and painful reminder to Kino that his race has always been kept poor and ignorant and that without money his son will never rise above that condition.
	Through the episode with the doctor we learn of the social stratification in the town. The prosperous descendents of the Spanish conquerors, like the doctor, still maintain the master/slave relationship with the natives whom they suppress with ignorance and poverty. Those natives who try to step outside the traditional relations are censured and, in Kino's case, publicly humiliated. Kino's futile striking of the doctor's iron gate with his fist belies his suppressed rage and bitterness.

734,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"

	The second chapter begins with a description of the town's broad estuary. Steinbeck characteristically begins with the larger panorama of the lay of the land and then moves into progressively smaller details in the landscape. On the beach are the villager's canoes -- seaworthy boats that are passed down from father to son and are protected against the elements by a shell plaster made from a secret recipe known only to the fishing people. Also on the beach are dogs and pigs that search for dead fish and birds to eat. The estuary is home to numerous sea flora and fauna such as fiddler crabs, eel grass and the poisonous spotted botete fish. Due to the effects of the sun and sea mist a hazy blanket of moisture often hangs over the coast and causes mirages to appear. As a result the villagers have learned to trust their instincts more than their eyes.
	Kino and Juana with Coyotito come to the beach to put out to sea in Kino's canoe. The canoe has been handed down from Kino's grandfather and father and is his only valuable possession; moreover, without the canoe Kino and his family would be unable to fish and hunt pearls and they would starve. Kino places his diving rock and ropes in the canoe.
	Juana puts a seaweed poultice on Coyotito's arm. The narrator observes that the poultice will do more for the baby's wound than anything the doctor could do but that, in her ignorance, Juana prays that Kino might find a pearl of sufficient value to pay the doctor. Kino and Juana get in the canoe and together they paddle out to the oyster bed. The narrator states that this oyster bed has been well worked since the days when it made the King of Spain a great power. A pearl forms in an oyster when a grain of sand irritates the oyster's flesh until the oyster forms a protective shell around the irritation. The resulting pearl is thus an accident and finding one is a matter of luck.
	Using his diving stone, Kino sinks to the seafloor and carefully begins placing oysters in his basket. The Song of the Sea is in Kino's ears and interwoven with it is the Song of the Pearl That Might Be. Because of Coyotito's illness the Song of the Pearl is louder that day than on other days. Kino is young and strong and can hold is breath for more than two minutes at a time. Just before Kino reaches the point where he must return to the surface for air, however, he sees a large oyster with a reflective flash inside. Hopeful, Kino grabs the oyster and returns to the canoe. Not wanting to press their luck, Juana and Kino ignore the large oyster for a moment but Kino soon opens it with his knife and they discover a large, perfect pearl. The narrator describes it as ""the greatest pearl in the world.""
	Holding the pearl in his damaged hand, Kino begins to imagine the possibilities that have suddenly opened up to him through the wealth the pearl will bring his family. Juana calls Kino's attention to Coyotito's shoulder where the swelling has subsided and Kino's joy at his good fortune overflows in a loud cry of happiness that all the other oyster divers out on the water can hear.
	Analysis
	Steinbeck begins this chapter by first describing the larger panorama of the surrounding terrain before moving onto descriptions of progressively smaller details in the landscape. In this manner the fisherpeople are linked to the larger natural world of the estuary, which encompasses not only the lush sea life, but also the villager's canoes on the beach and the curtain of Gulf moisture that pervades the town.
	The narrator's interjections throughout this chapter are important for through them we learn details that are hidden from the characters but which affect our reading of them. For instance, the reader knows that the seaweed poultice will do more to treat Coyotito's wound than anything the doctor could have provided will. Juana, who does not know this, continues to pray for money to pay the doctor. The narrator also informs the reader that the pearl that Kino holds is ""the pearl of the world."" Because Kino does not know this he will never know what constitutes its fair market value.
	This chapter also serves to broaden the reader's understanding of Juana's role in the family. We learn, for instance, that she is an active and necessary partner in the process of gathering pearls. Thus, not only does she sustain the family by caring for Coyotito and preparing their meals but she also helps row the canoe to the oyster beds. Her relationship with Kino has a strong element of pragmatism made necessary by their poverty and the physical difficulties inherent to their daily work. This is why the narrator observes of Kino's canoe that ""it was at one property and source of food, for a man with a boat can guarantee a woman that she will eat something.""
	The narrator's description of pearls as the accidental byproducts of the irritation caused by a grain of sand in an oyster muscle, serves to establish the cause for their rarity and thus their value. It also serves to establish the degree of luck it takes to find one, much less a truly valuable one. The Song of the Pearl that Might Be consists of Kino's dreams, anxieties and prayers - all of which play a part in his submarine search. The narrator suggests that because of Coyotito's wound the need for a valuable pearl is even greater for Kino on that day than on others and the song is more audible in Kino's ears as a result. In this way the narrator connects the scorpion's sting to Kino's discovery of the pearl.
	The moment Kino sees the pearl he is changed by the possibilities it holds for his family. Just like the pearl was a kind of seed embedded in the oyster, so now are Kino's dreams of a new life embedded in his psyche because of the pearl.

735,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"

	As is the nature of small towns the news of Kino's discovery spreads quickly so that by the time Kino and Juana reach shore everyone has heard about the pearl. In town, the Priest hears the news and tries to remember if he married Kino and Juana in the church. The doctor hears of the pearl while sitting with a wealthy patient and claims that he is treating Kino's son for a scorpion bite. The beggars hear of the pearl and look forward to alms from Kino. The pearl buyers, all of whom work for the same man, know that Kino will bring the pearl to one of them and though they will only make their normal salary on the transaction each dreams of taking their boss' place. Indeed, the whole town comes to transfer their dreams and desires onto to Kino's pearl and to think of it as potentially their own with only Kino standing in the way. The narrator says that the news of the pearl ""stirred up something infinitely black and evil in the town"" and that the ""poison sacs of the town began to manufacture venom, and the town swelled with the pressure of it.""
	Kino and Juana, meanwhile, are ignorant of the town's malignant desires. When the indians of the village come to see the pearl and admire its perfection Juan Tomas asks Kino what he will do when now that he is a rich man. Kino, looking into the pearl, replies that he and Juana will be married in the church, they will wear fine clothes and he will own a rifle. After Kino announces that he will have his own rifle, otherwise an impossible luxury for any indian of the village, he begins to dream of even greater things and realizes that his ultimate dream is that Coyotito go to school so that his son may learn to read and write and free his people from the cycle of poverty and exploitation in which they have been trapped for generations.
	It is a noteworthy occasion and the villagers who are watching understand that whether Kino succeeds or fails to obtain riches and good fortune they will always remember the day that he found the pearl. Juana begins to make the fire for the family's evening meal but before the visitors leave their hut the Priest enters accompanied by the song of evil. The Priest has always treated the indians like children and Kino is suspicious of his motives when the Priest tries to gain Kino's favor by telling him that Kino is named after a great father of the Church. The Priest asks to see the pearl and, awed by its beauty, he asks that Kino and Juana remember to give thanks to God. Juana proudly tells the Priest that she and Kino will be married in the Church and the Priest blesses them before leaving.
	While Juana prepares the beans for their evening meal, Kino steps outside the hut but he is immediately overcome by feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. He grasps the pearl tightly in his hand. He hears the song of the family coming from the kitchen but mixed with the song is the knowledge that since he has made a plan to send Coyotito to school he will have to struggle to make that plan reach fruition. At this point, the doctor arrives and pretends that he had always intended to treat the baby. Suspicious of the doctor's motives, Kino explains that Coyotito is feeling better but the doctor insists that the poison could return in the night and that only he, the doctor, can prevent the young one's death. Juana believes the doctor and Kino, crushed by his own ignorance, reluctantly lets the doctor treat Coyotito with a pill of white powder that Kino suspects is simply more poison. Before leaving, the doctor warns Kino that the poison from the scorpion will return within the hour.
	The doctor returns to his comfortable home where he nibbles at dinner and waits for an hour to pass. Kino folds the pearl into a rag and buries it in the corner of the hut. In the estuary a school of big fish feed on small fish and the noise of the battle carries to the village. After Kino has eaten his beans Juana calls him over to look at Coyotito who is now very sick. The doctor returns and many of the village people crowd into the hut to see him do battle with the scorpion's poison. The doctor gives Coyotito some diluted ammonia solution and the baby's stomach spasms relent. Juana is thankful but Kino remains suspicious. The doctor, pretending not to know of Kino's pearl, asks how he will pay for Coyotito's treatment and after the villagers tell the doctor of the pearl the doctor offers to keep it in his safe. The doctor watches Kino's eyes which betray the pearl's hiding place when Kino refuses the doctors offer and claims that the pearl is secure. Kino tells the doctor he will pay him after he has sold the pearl in the morning. The doctor leaves.
	Kino is restless and Juana watches him dig up the pearl and rebury it under his sleeping mat. Juana asks Kino whom he fears and Kino answers that he fears everyone. Kino, Juana and Coyotito lay down together to sleep and Kino dreams of his son in school but the dream turns to a nightmare and Kino awakes to the sound of someone digging inside the house. Kino lunges at the intruder with his knife but he is struck in the head and the intruder gets away. Juana cleans Kino's bleeding wound and sensing the hatred growing in her husband she insists that the pearl is evil and should be destroyed before it destroys the family. But Kino insists that after they sell the pearl everything will be better. It is near dawn and Kino removes the pearl from its hiding place. The contentment it brings Kino spreads to Juana and they are both happy and hopeful as the sun rises.
	Analysis
	Now that Kino has brought the pearl to shore and claimed it his own the close ties that once made the small town safe and familiar to him now work to turn the people's greed against Kino. This is illustrated when he steps out into the evening and is filled with a sense of foreboding on the same spot that had that very morning filled him with contentment. He does not know specifically who his enemies are but, as he tells Juana, he fears everyone. This is a new feeling for Kino and is indicative of the manner in which the pearl brings not only the possibility of wealth but uncertainty and danger as well. The danger brought by the scorpion has been transferred to the people of the town and Steinbeck's direct comparison between the two furthers the sharp divisions between good and evil that marks the story as a parable.
	The pearl causes Kino to dream of things, like the rifle or an education, that were outside his previous station. As a result, the dreams have brought danger into his life and begun change him. After Kino finishes listing the things he will do with the wealth derived from the pearl the narrator remarks that Kino ""had never said so many words together in his life."" Juana senses the change in her husband after the attack and though she can see the potential for evil in the pearl she too is beguiled by the previously unattainable luxuries, like medical care for her son, made possible by the pearl. Juana also betrays her own dreams and biases when she proudly tells the priest that she and Kino will be married in the church. Furthermore, because she was unable to trust in the healing power of the seaweed poultice she and Kino have been duped by the doctor and become indebted to him.
	The doctor is revealed by his actions to be not only arrogant but duplicitous. The implication for the reader is that he is the force behind the night intruder. At the end of the chapter both Juana and Kino hope to exchange the pearl, which removed from nature has become an object of the town's greed and thus dangerous to them, for wealth that they believe will transform their family for the better

736,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"

	It is early in the morning and the whole town of La Paz knows that this is the day that Kino will sell his pearl. The pearl buyers wait anxiously in their stalls to offer the lowest price possible for Kino's pearl. The narrator makes the point that this doesn't make them evil, it only makes them good pearl buyers because every man should strive to be his best their low bidding is a natural result of their station. The moisture in the air is especially thick and creates the mirage of a large mountain to the north of the city. The pearl divers stay on shore to witness the sale of Kino's pearl. Kino's neighbors discuss what they would do with the money and they hope that the pearl will not destroy Kino and his family by making them greedy. Because it is a special morning, Juana, Coyotito and Kino dress in their best clothes, which are simple and ragged but clean. Kino puts on his straw hat and checks to make sure it rides properly on his head - too far back or on the side would be indicative of a young, rash man and directly atop his head would be too much like an old man. Kino's hat rides slightly forward to indicate aggressiveness and certainty of purpose.
	Many people follow the family as they walk into town but only Juan Thomes walks beside Kino. The two men agree that Kino must be careful not to be cheated but since neither knows what is paid for the pearls outside La Paz they are unsure how to value the pearl. Juan Thomes tells of a time before Kino was born when the elders of the village decided to hire an agent to take their pearls directly to the capital but after two men disappeared en route they gave up on the attempt and returned to the old way of going through the pearl buyers. Kino notes that as a result, the priest at that time and to the current day annually preached a sermon warning that each man should know his station in life and not try to better himself. The sun is intense and the brother's squint their eyes at the glare. The narrator notes that squinting is the only form of defense the poor indians have ever had against the descendents of the conquerors. As the procession makes it way through town many people come out of their homes to watch it pass.
	In his office, a stout slow pearl buyer hopes that Kino will come to him. Like all the other buyers he has a black velvet-lined pearl tray in front of him. While he waits and hopes, the pearl buyer practices sleight of hand with a coin in his right hand below the desk. Kino enters this man's office and receives a kind greeting. The buyer continues to practice with his coin out of sight. Playing for dramatic effect, Kino slowly brings out his deerskin pouch and rolls the great pearl onto the buyer's tray. The buyer's face betrays no reaction but under the desk his fingers stumble with the coin and it drops into his lap. All the spectators hold their breath waiting to hear the buyer's offer. The dealer declares that the pearl is a monstrosity and of little value except as an oddity. The buyer denies Kino's insistence that it is a very valuable pearl and offers him only a thousand pesos. Kino accuses the buyer of trying to cheat him. The buyer assures Kino that the pearl is not valuable and to prove his claim he has a boy bring three other buyers to the office. Because they all work for the same man, these buyers know how much has been offered and none of them make a higher bid. Kino angrily insists he has been cheated and suggests that he will take the pearl to capital himself. The buyers realize too late that they have underbid by too great a sum and the man ups his offer to 1,500 pesos before Kino angrily storms out of his office.
	Later that evening, the villagers discuss the event. Some believe the buyer and think Kino a fool not to have taken the generous offer of 1,500 pesos, others think that the buyers will never do business with Kino again and that he has destroyed himself in his brashness. Still others believe that Kino is courageous and silently hope for the best. Kino reburies the pearl and decides that though he is afraid of leaving the village he will do it and attempt to sell the pearl in the capital. Juan Thomes comes to visit and expresses his fears for Kino and observes that he has defied the village's way of life. Kino retorts that he must try to better himself and Juan Thomes gives his blessing.
	Much later in the evening Kino is sitting despondently in the hut listening to the night noises and he senses evil things lurking outside. He steps outside with his knife in hand and is immediately attacked. Juana rushes to his aid, armed with a stone, but the assailants have retreated into the shadows and Kino is lying hurt with a bloody scalp and a long, deep cut from his ear to his chin. After Juana has cleaned Kino's wounds she again beseeches him to destroy the pearl and declares it a thing of evil that will destroy them if they keep it. Kino insists that he will overcome the evil and they shall not be cheated of their good fortune. He insists that she believe him because he is a man. Juana asserts that she is afraid because a man can be killed but Kino pays her no heed. Kino asks if she is afraid to go with him, over the sea and mountains to the capital and she answers that she will go. They lie down to sleep.
	Analysis
	During the course of this chapter Kino and Juana realize the true strength of the forces arrayed against them. Though many people accompany them to the pearl buyer's office, it is more out of curiosity than for support. This is proven later when many of the villagers believe Kino has been foolish not to accept the offer of 1,500 pesos. Since none of the buyers will make what Kino feels to be a fair offer on the large pearl, Kino realizes that he will have to take the pearl to the city himself and that he will not be able to capitalize on his good luck as easily as he hoped. Furthermore, as the story Juan Thomes tells illustrates, he will now be defying the set way of doing things and may suffer as a consequence.
	The pearl buyer's habit of practicing ledgermain with a coin is an effective literary device that illustrates his skill in bargaining without recourse to outright narrative exposition. The moment when he drops the coin upon seeing the pearl indicates to the reader that he recognizes the pearl's true value. Furthermore, the fact that his face does not betray this knowledge further illustrates to the reader the pearl buyer's skill as a broker.
	After the second, more deadly attack upon Kino, Juana is convinced that the pearl will bring them nothing but destruction but Kino asserts his status as a man and insists that he can turn the pearl to fortune. That Juana agrees to accompany him to the capital illustrates her continued faith in him as well as her sense of place in the family. She has a voice but must acquiesce to her husband's decisions. Her decision to accompany him reveals that she is still most comfortable in her traditional role even though her husband is seeking to change his own role in the community.

737,The Pearl: Novel Summary: Chapter 5,"

	Kino awakens late in the night and watches Juana go the pearl's hiding place after which she slips quietly out the door. Full of anger, Kino follows her to the shore where he stops her just as she is about to throw the pearl into the sea. Kino strikes Juana brutally in the face and then kicks her in the side after she has fallen to the ground. Throughout this ordeal Juana makes no attempt to resist. Kino takes the pearl and leaves Juana lying in the surf. On his way back to the hut, however, several assailants assault Kino. Though he pierces one of his attackers with his knife the others strike him to the ground and search Kino's pockets. Meanwhile Juana washes her bruised face in the ocean. She holds no grudge against Kino because she believes men to be half-insane and half gods and she believes she could not live without one. She accepts these differences between the sexes as the way of the world. On her way home Juana finds the pearl behind a stone where Kino dropped it during the assault and then she sees Kino and another man with a fatal gash in his throat lying on the beach. Juana realizes in an instant that their old life is irrevocably gone and that they must flee or be destroyed. While she drags the dead man into the bushes Kino comes back to consciousness and begins mourning for the loss of his pearl. Juana explains quickly that she has the pearl and that because Kino has killed a man they must leave immediately. Kino agrees that they would not receive fair treatment if the case was presented in town and they decide to flee together. Juana goes to gather Coyotito and all their available food from the hut while Kino goes to get his canoe ready for the journey.
	Kino discovers that someone has knocked a hole in the bottom of his canoe - an unthinkable crime in the village. Numbed by the loss of his canoe Kino walks toward his hut but before he reaches it he sees flames leaping into the predawn sky. He encounters Juana holding Coyotito. Juana explains that she returned to the hut to find that it had been ransacked and then, as she searched the wreckage, someone had set fire to it from the outside. Kino, Juana and Coyotito slip into Juan Thomes' house before anyone sees them. Apolonia returns distraught from watching Kino's hut burn and is surprised to find them alive and in her hut. At Kino's command, however, she fetches Juan Thomes who, after hearing that Kino has killed a man, agrees to hide his brother until nightfall. Kino, Juana and Coyotito spend the day hiding in Juan Thomes' hut while Juan Thomes spreads various theories among the villagers as to where Kino might have disappeared. A fierce storm lashes the water throughout the course of the day and none of the pearl divers take their boats to sea. Under various pretences, Juan Thomes borrows food and tools, including a long knife, from his neighbors and gives them to Kino. Kino tells his brother that he and his family will go overland to the north where they believe there are cities where they can sell the pearl. Before Kino leaves he tells his brother that he cannot give up the pearl because it has become part of his soul.
	Analysis
	This chapter chronicles the further deterioration of Kino's former life as he fights with Juana, suffers the loss of his canoe and home and is again assaulted by an unknown enemy. Thus, the process begun with the discovery of the pearl and Kino's refusals to accept the buyer's offer has now come to bloodshed.
	When Kino kills his assailant the ties to his life as a member of the village are forever sundered. He is now a murderer and, though he killed in self-defense, he knows that the officials in the town will not believe his story.
	Juana's attempt to throw the pearl into the sea demonstrates the depth of her conviction that the pearl, far from a source of wealth and prosperity, is actually a thing of evil. Although she is willing to defy Kino by throwing it into the sea she is equally willing to suffer his blows and accept his will as the head of the family. Significantly, it is Juana who saves the pearl, drags the dead man into the bushes, insists that they leave immediately and retrieves Coyotito from the burning hut all of which make possible the family's continued survival. Kino's attachment to the pearl is revealed in his state of helplessness when he believes it to have been stolen and his confession to his brother that it has become one with his soul.
	Juan Thomes' willingness to shelter Kino and the pearl, even if only for a day indicates that he is Kino's one true friend left in the village. Aside from Juan Thomes, however, there is no reason to believe that anyone in La Paz, whether indian or not, will help Kino in his attempt to create real prosperity for his family. The destruction of Kino's canoe is an event which the narrator qualifies with the observations that ""the killing of a man was not so evil as the killing of a boat"" and that as a result there was ""sorrow in Kino's rage, but this last thing [destruction of the canoe] had tightened him beyond breaking."" The force of these statements leads the reader to understand that because of the destruction of Kino's canoe not only will the family's escape be more difficult but also their old way of life has been violated, never again to be made whole.

	In the night Kino and Juana with Coyotito skirt the edge of the town and take the road through the brush country towards Loreto. The night is windy and Kino is thankful because the wind will erase their tracks on the dusty path. The family walks all night and the wind dies down soon after moonrise. Tapping into the ancient ways of his people, Kino is exceptionally ""cautious and wary and dangerous"" like a hunted animal and is careful that they should walk in the wheel ruts so that in the morning the first wagon will erase their prints. At dawn they take shelter off the road behind a clump of trees and Kino uses a branch to wipe away the footprints where they left the road.
	Kino and Juana eat some of Apolonia's corncakes and then Juana falls asleep but Kino stays awake. The air is hot and dry. When Juana awakes at midday she asks him if they will be followed and Kino answers that most likely they will but he doesn't know who attacked him or who will follow. Kino reiterates his desire for a rifle once the pearl is sold. Kino looks deep into the pearl's surface and is shocked by a series of images: the man he has stabbed, Juana crawling painfully through the surf and Coyotito's face flushed with fever. The music of the pearl has become the music of evil. Kino puts the pearl away and eventually falls asleep.
	Juana stays awake and plays with Coyotito after he awakes. Kino begins to thrash in the grip of a nightmare and comes awake fully alert. He creeps to a clump of bushes by the road and sees two trackers on foot and a rifleman on a horse coming down the road. Kino knows that these men are experts and if they find the place he has swept he will have to lunge forward and try to kill the gunman first. After pausing at the spot, however, the trio continues down the road. Kino knows they will return and panic takes hold of him. He suggests to Juana that he should surrender but she reminds him that the trackers will not allow him to live once they have the pearl. Kino decides that the family should flee overland into the stony mountains were it will be more difficult to follow their trail.
	As Kino and Juana frantically make their way across the scorched arid landscape toward the granite mountains Kino hears the song of evil resounding clearly in his head. They pause at the first rise in the land and Juana and Coyotito drink the last of the water. Kino tells his wife to hide and wait for the trackers to pass and he will continue alone. Juana refuses to leave him and Kino takes strength from her resolution. Moving with more purpose now, Kino and his family zigzag toward the mountains in an effort to throw off the trackers. The ground begins to rise steeply and Kino readjusts their course toward a cleft in the mountains that looks like it might contain water. He knows that the trackers may have the same thought but without water his family will not survive so he has no choice. The narrator describes the rivulet of water in the cleft that draws all the animals in the area either to drink or to hunt the game that comes to drink - in this way the rivulet is a giver of both life and death.
	By the time Kino, Juana and Coyotito reach the water the sun has set behind the mountains. There is still enough light, however, for Kino to see that far behind them the trackers have begun to follow the family's path to the cleft. He knows they will arrive before dark. Juana and Coyotito hide in one of the shallow cave-like depressions in the cliff wall and Kino joins them after creating a diversionary path further up the cliff. Juana promises that the baby will not cry because she claims he knows of the danger.
	The trackers and the gunman eventually arrive at the spring and although they see Kino's diversionary trail they decide to settle for the night. Kino can see the tracker's cigarettes glowing in the night. Juana struggles to keep the baby silent. One of the men strikes a match and Kino can see that he is sitting up with the rifle and the other two are asleep. Kino tells Juana that he will sneak up on the man and seize the rifle but he must do so before the moon rises and sheds too much light. Although she initially resists the idea, Juana accepts it once she realizes they will be discovered in the morning.
	Kino removes his white clothes because ""his own brown skin was better protection for him"" and cautiously makes his way to just a few yards from the watchman. The song of the family is in Kino's ears as he slowly edges closer. Just as Kino is about to pounce on the man and seize the gun, the moon rises and fills the area with light. Kino hesitates a moment and in that instant he hears the sound of Coyotito crying from above. The watcher stands up, awakening one of the sleepers and they decide that the sound, which repeats, might be a coyote pup. The rifleman cocks his gun to fire at the sound and Kino jumps, but too late to prevent the man from getting off a shot. Kino stabs the rifleman in the neck and chest, fatally strikes the seated man and shoots the third with the rifle as he tries to flee up the side of the cliff. In the ensuing silence Kino hears Juana's hysterical cries and he knows that his son is dead.
	Late in the afternoon Kino and Juana return to the La Paz carrying the dead Coyotito in a blood soaked bundle. They walk into town side by side, Juana is distant and fatigued, Kino full of danger and fear. The narrator interjects that perhaps because the setting sun cast long shadows this is what ""left the deep impression on those who saw them."" The neighbors stand away as they pass and Juan Tomas raises his hand in greeting but does not speak. Kino now hears the song of the family as a battle cry as they steadily make their way to the seashore where he removes the pearl and sees in its surface an image of his dead son. He first offers the pearl to Juana to throw in the ocean. She shakes her head, indicating that Kino must do it himself. Using all his strength, Kino throws the pearl far into the ocean where it settles to the bottom and is soon covered by the sand raised by a scuttling crab.
	Analysis
	This chapter begins with the details of the family's departure from the town and the subsequent pursuit. The narrator interjects at several points to describe the manner in which Kino has become more like an animal fleeing danger. In some instances, as when he thinks to walk in the wagon ruts, this serves is to his advantage but as in the case where he and the family haphazardly run to the high place ""as nearly all animals do when they are pursued"" his animal instincts override his ability to reason. The narrator's vivid description of the spring to which they flee underscore the fact that Kino and Juana have become only the most recent example of animals driven to its water to either take sustenance or bring death. Once he is cornered Kino resolves to attack the pursuers before they can discover the family and to do this he removes his clothing and completes his transformation. The family has become little more than hunted game sheltering in a makeshift den. Significantly, Coyotito's cries are mistaken for that of a Coyote pup and Juana's primal screams are described as ""the cry of death"".
	Kino's confidence in the pearl begins to waver during the course of the pursuit. Not only does he consider surrendering after he first sees the trackers but he panics and leads the family pell-mell across the plain without regard for the easy trail they are leaving for the trackers. In both instances, Juana reassures him and reaffirms his need for preservation. Most importantly, the visions of prosperity and happiness Kino once saw in the pearl change and become dark and macabre. Finally, after Coyotito's death, Kino understands that the pearl has brought evil to his family and he is able to throw it back into the sea. Significantly he offers Juana, who was first to understand the evil of the pearl, the chance to dispose of it. True to her station, however, Juana remains steadfast as Kino's wife and returns his manhood to him by insisting that he do the deed himself.
	At story's end, his association with the pearl has irrevocably changed Kino. Whereas the song of the family was once filled with comfort and security it now sounds like a call to battle. Kino is at once full of anger for the misery that has been wrought upon his family and full of fear for the future. Of the things Kino wished for from the pearl only the rifle has come to fruition. He returns to the village holding the rifle and Juana returns holding their dead son. The juxtaposition of these images makes clear the price Kino has paid for his daring wish for a rifle.

739,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary,"The story begins at the camp of the Union army during the Civil War. The men have been at camp for a long time. A tall soldier tells his comrades he is convinced they are about to move on the enemy, which is camped the other side of the river. Some men disagree, and there is a spirited debate. A young private listens to the debate, and then retreats to his hut to be alone. He is full of anticipation that he is about to participate in his first battle. He is a romantic, idealist young man, raised on a farm, who has dreamed of battles all his life. He had wanted to enlist in the Union army, but his mother discouraged him. Eventually he enlisted, against his mother’s wishes. Reluctantly, she lets him go. His friends all admire him for enlisting. On the way to Washington with his regiment, he is treated like a hero. Following that, he had to put up with months of monotony in a camp, an endless round of drills and reviews. He sees almost nothing of the enemy, and doubts whether he will ever be a part of a real battle. He listens to the stories of veterans, but he does not know how much to believe. He suddenly thinks that perhaps in a battle, he might run away. This question worries him.
	The tall soldier and the loud private he is arguing with join the youth in the hut. The youth, whose name is Henry Fleming, asks the tall soldier directly whether there is going to be a battle, and the soldier assures him there will be. Henry asks the soldier’s opinion about how the regiment will perform, since it is composed mostly of men who have never been in a battle. The soldier says that some may run away, but in general they will fight well. Henry asks the tall soldier, whose name is Jim Conklin, whether he had ever thought he might run himself. Jim replies that if a lot of men started to run, he probably would as well. But if everyone stood and fought, he would too. Henry is reassured by Jim’s statement.
Analysis
	The first chapter sets the scene and introduces the main characters. By not giving any specific details of place or time, or even stating directly which army Henry is a member of, the author gives the scene a general rather than specific significance. He intends to explore the psychological aspects of war as it is experienced by the ordinary soldier, so the generality of the descriptions carry significance beyond their time and place. (The novel is in fact loosely based on the Civil War battle of Chancellorville in May, 1863, although nowhere is this stated.) The author’s desire to create a universal effect is also seen in the way the characters in this chapter are described. For the most part, they are the “tall soldier,” the “loud private,” and “the youth,” rather than being given specific names.
	This chapter also shows that Henry has reached a crucial point in his life. As a young boy, he had thought of war as a romantic, glorious enterprise, although he also believed that it was something that belonged to the pages of history, not something that could happen in the present. When the Civil War breaks out, at first he does not take it seriously, and thinks that no war could match the heroics he has read about in ancient Greek books. Men had been civilized and had lost the savage spirit that used to animate them. But now war has come, and he has enlisted, he will begin to discover a lot about himself that he had previously not even thought about. The key issue is how he will behave in battle. He is disturbed by thoughts that he may run away. The thoughts he has on that subject suggest that the novel will be about the mind of a young soldier as he faces combat for the first time. It is the psychological aspects of war that will be the focus, not so much the physical events, although they will be vividly described also.

",The Red Badge of Courage
741,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 2-4,"The tall soldier’s information proves to be incorrect. The army does not move. But Henry is still troubled by the question of whether he will run away when battle begins, and he gets frustrated because he knows there is no way he can answer this question until the time comes. He wonders what the rest of the men are thinking, but he dare not ask. Sometimes he thinks they are all heroes; at other times he convinces himself they are all fearful of the prospect of battle. In his anxiety he frequently reproaches himself for his thoughts, and sometimes fixes his anger upon the generals, whom he regards as intolerably slow.
	One morning, just before dawn, Henry is convinced that a battle is imminent. The regiment begins to march. There is a vigorous discussion among the men as to what will happen. They seem in good spirits, but Henry is weighed down by his own thoughts. At nightfall they stop in a field and set up camp. Henry keeps to himself as much as possible. He lies down in the grass and wishes he were back home on the farm. The loud private, whose name is Wilson, joins him. Wilson believes there will soon be a big battle, and that they will be victorious. Henry asks him how he knows he will not run when the time comes. Wilson says of course he will not run. His confident reply makes Henry feel miserable, since it is clear that their viewpoints have nothing in common. He torments himself with his fears about how he will react to battle, and eventually falls asleep.
	The following night, the military columns file across the river on two pontoon bridges. The next morning they march along a road that leads them deep into a forest. Then at dawn one morning, the men start to run down a road together. There is the sound of distant firing. Henry realizes the time for battle has come. It is impossible for him to escape. His mind plays tricks with him, and he convinces himself that he never wanted to go to war; the government had forced him into it. They cross a stream and climb a hill. A skirmish is already underway; he sees the body of a dead soldier, and expects the enemy to fall upon them at any moment. He thinks the generals are all idiots, and considers shouting a warning to all the men. Harried by a young lieutenant, Henry quickens his pace. The regiment marches from place to place apparently aimlessly. Henry is impatient, and complains to Jim Conklin and Wilson.
	In the afternoon the regiment, having just gone over the same ground it covered earlier, enters a new region. Henry thinks it would be better to get killed instantly; that at least would end his worries. When they get close to the battle, Jim confesses to Henry that he expects to be killed. He gives Henry a packet of his belongings and tells him to convey it to his, Jim’s, family.
	The men of the regiment exchange rumors of what is happening in the battle. The noise increases and the bullets begin to fly close to them. The lieutenant is shot in the hand. As the battle intensifies, the men of the new regiment are breathless with horror. Many men are fleeing from the battle, although Henry has not yet seen what they are fleeing from. He resolves to get a good view of it, thinking all the time that once he has done this, he will probably run faster than any of them.
Analysis
	Although surrounded by his comrades, Henry is very much alone with his thoughts, knowing that the question he has asked of himself will soon be answered. His verbal abuse of the generals, which other characters also express, show that this is a novel written from the point of view of the ordinary soldier who knows nothing of what his generals are planning. The commanders in this war are seen only from afar.
	Although this is a realistic novel, many passages are tinged with irony. For example, there is a quiet irony in the description of how the soldiers of the new regiment, as they march, start to look like more experienced soldiers. But there is one thing about them that is different from veteran regiments: “Veteran regiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men” (ch. 3, p. 32). What this means is that large numbers of the soldiers in the regiment have been killed. The understated way of expressing this fact is probably more horrifying than a simple statement of the number of casualties would have been. And the passage that follows, in which other soldiers mistake the decimated regiment for a brigade (which is much smaller than a regiment) underlines the irony. It is also significant that rather than react with horror, the other soldiers laugh when they realize their mistake. This is a defense mechanism whereby they keep the knowledge of their own possible, even likely, fate at bay.
	In these chapters, Henry is contrasted with two other characters. The first is the lieutenant. Henry considers himself to have a fine mind, and he contrasts himself with the lieutenant who roughly pushes him on faster. Henry regards the lieutenant as a mere brute. Later in the novel, however, this will change. The two men will find they have a lot in common and they will form a bond.
	Henry is also contrasted with Jim Conklin, who gives every appearance of being brave and confident, and with Wilson, who feels sorry for himself and expects to be killed. (But at least Wilson admits to Henry what he is feeling; Henry always keeps his thoughts to himself.)
",The Red Badge of Courage
742,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 5-7,"The enemy advances on Henry’s regiment, and the battle begins. Henry wonders whether his rifle is loaded, but then as he sees the foe swarming toward him in the field, he fires a wild shot. Then he gets caught up in the battle and feels a sense of brotherhood with his comrades. He also feels rage at the enemy and regrets that he can only use his rifle against one man at a time. A man tries to run, but is pushed back into the fray by the lieutenant. He is immediately grazed in the head by a shot. After a period of fighting, Henry realizes that the enemy has been repulsed. The men celebrate. Wounded men make their way to the rear.
	Henry feels very satisfied. He believes he performed heroically, and the men continue to congratulate each other. But then a shout goes up: the enemy is coming upon them again. Many of the men believe they will not be able to withstand this second assault. Henry feels physically weak, and finds that he is exaggerating the prowess of the enemy. He waits, horrified. He sees a few men fleeing, yells with fright, and runs too, as fast as he can, leaving his rifle behind. As he runs he fears death at any moment. He runs past the artillery gunners, and watches another brigade going to the relief of their comrades. When the noise of the battle subsides, he runs more slowly. He observes a harassed general on horseback. The general then gets word from an officer that the assault of the enemy has been repulsed.
	Henry cringes when he overhears this news. He is angry. He justifies his cowardice by telling himself that he did the right thing by saving himself, because at the time it seemed as if death was imminent. It was his duty to save himself. Had his comrades been more intelligent, they too would have realized that it made sense to abandon their position. He thinks they are fools and is angry with them. He walks deep into a wood to get away from the sounds of the battle, which is still going on in other areas. He climbs a tree, still insisting to himself that he was right to preserve his own life. Then he continues to walk in the forest. He encounters a dead soldier, shrieks at the gruesome sight, and then flees from it.
Analysis
	The events that lead to Henry’s act of cowardice have great psychological veracity. On his first engagement in battle, Henry performs adequately, as does almost everyone else in the new regiment. They naturally feel relief when the battle is over, and they relax and celebrate. When they become aware that the enemy is about to charge again, they are simply not mentally prepared for another battle. It is not what they are expecting. Their resolve the second time around is therefore much weaker. As Henry realized in the first stage of the battle, an army is a collective thing. If the regiment fights well, there is a kind of group momentum that carries everyone along with it. But the same applies in reverse. Henry does not run away in a vacuum. He first sees two other men running. Once the cohesion of the regiment is broken, it is no longer a single unit with what he called earlier a “common personality.” The contagion now works in the opposite direction; he runs because others are running. In neither case is he really acting as an individual; he is simply caught up in what is happening to the group.
	Henry’s attempts to justify his actions are also true to life. Like many a guilty person, he simply cannot admit to himself that he did something that was wrong or cowardly. For him to admit such a thing would make it almost impossible for him to go on living. So his mind spontaneously goes to work to convince him that in fact, he is the intelligent one who showed insight and foresight, and his comrades are the fools.
	There is also irony in the fact that Henry flees what he believes to be imminent defeat, only to find later that his side have triumphed. This makes his position even more difficult.
",The Red Badge of Courage
743,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 8-10,"When twilight comes, Henry hears renewed sounds of fighting, and he runs in the direction of the battle, fully aware of how ironical this action is. But he runs just to witness the battle; he has no intention of getting involved in it again. He thinks of the war as like the grinding of an immense machine, and he must get close to it and watch it. He comes upon a procession of wounded men making their way to the rear. He falls in with them. A tattered soldier covered with grime and blood, and wounded in the head and arm, walks at Henry’s side and tries to befriend him. He tries to get Henry to agree with him that it had been a good fight. He says all the soldiers on their side fought hard. Then he asks Henry where he is wounded. Henry panics and turns away from the man. He slips off into the crowd.
	Henry finds other wounded men to walk with, but he now thinks that his shame must be visible. He wishes he had a wound too, a “red badge of courage” (ch. 9, p. 67). He walks alongside a man who is badly wounded and near death. With horror he realizes it is Jim Conklin. When Jim recognizes Henry, he says he was worried about him. Henry says he will take care of him, but the tattered soldier tells Henry that Jim has only a few more minutes to live. Henry watches as Jim goes through his last moments before falling to the ground dead. At the sight of his dead friend, Henry turns with rage in the direction of the battlefield and shakes his fist.
	The tattered soldier and Henry leave the corpse and start back on their way. Henry is worried that the soldier may also die, but the tattered soldier says he will not. After they have talked a while, the tattered soldier again asks Henry where his injury is located. He assumes it may be an internal injury, since Henry carries no visible wound. Henry becomes angry at the man and tells him not to bother him. Then Henry says goodbye and wanders off by himself. He wishes he was dead. He feels unable to keep his crime of cowardice concealed.
Analysis
	In these three chapters, Henry is continually confronted with his own conscience. Wherever he turns he cannot escape it. This is the role the tattered soldier plays. He acts as a prick to Henry’s conscience. The tattered soldier’s tales of how well the men fought, and how much he admires them, is an awful thing for Henry to hear, carrying as it does a terrible reproach for his own cowardice. But then it gets even worse. Given that his listener is Henry, there is deep irony in the tattered soldier’s tale of meeting a boy from Georgia who said that the Union boys would run once they heard a gun. “Well, they didn’t run t’day, did they, hey?” he says to Henry (ch. 8. p. 66). Of course, Henry can make no response. Then twice the tattered soldier asks Henry, in all good intent, where he is wounded. It seems that Henry cannot escape from being reminded of his act of cowardice. All the men he meets now have visible badges of courage—their bleeding wounds. Henry’s wound is indeed internal and invisible, as the tattered soldier believes, although what the soldier means by that is something quite different from the reality.
	The contrast between Jim and Henry reaches its starkest moment here. They have similar backgrounds. They have known each other since childhood. But Jim faced up to his responsibilities and paid the heaviest price a man can pay. No wonder Henry is tortured by grief at Jim’s fate, since it is inextricably mixed up with his own feelings of guilt, which can only become worse as a result of his friend’s death.
",The Red Badge of Courage
744,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 11-12,"The noise of the battle grows louder and Henry watches a column of retreating men and wagons. Because they are retreating, he feels a kind of vindication of his own actions. Then he sees a column of infantry moving in the other direction, toward the battle. This fills him with misery. He feels he can never be like these men, who are filled with glory. But then for a few moments, he wants to join them, and he visualizes himself doing great deeds on the battlefield. Then he realizes how difficult such a course of action would be—he has no rifle, and does not know where his regiment is. His mind goes this way and that, until he abandons his plan to return to battle. At about this time he becomes conscious of the many ailments that afflict him. He has a raging thirst, every bone in his body aches, and he is hungry. He becomes even more despondent, and believes that he will never become a hero. But he still seeks moral vindication. He reasons that if his army has been defeated, this could have advantages for him. Whole regiments would be shattered and scattered; many brave men would have been forced to desert. He would then be able to appear as just like one of them—even better in fact, he reasons, since his superior powers of perception had enabled him to see the coming defeat much earlier than others, and to take the only appropriate action. Then his mind turns again, and he regards himself as a villain and wishes he was dead. He convinces himself that it is not possible that his army should be defeated, and he tries to think up a plausible story he could take back to his regiment to explain his absence. But he cannot invent a story that does not have holes in it, and he imagines the derision he will face from his comrades if he returns.
	Henry encounters more retreating soldiers coming fast in his direction. Soon he is in the midst of them. The scene is chaotic. Henry tries to talk to one of the men, but the man is in a rage and he hits Henry on the head with his rifle. Henry collapses on the ground and rises only with great difficulty. His head is bleeding. The scene is still chaotic, and he moves away from it. He can hear the sounds of a huge battle taking place and he hurries on as dusk comes, worrying about the wound he has sustained. His head feels swollen, and he gets very weary. Another soldier sees him and starts to walk with him. He is friendly, asks Henry a lot of questions and talks a lot, telling stories of the battle. He finds out which regiment Henry is in, and guides him back to it.
Analysis
	In these chapters Henry’s mind swings from one extreme to another. He has no stable point of reference. He does not know how he should think of himself, so he fluctuates between moral justifications of his act and bitter self-condemnation. He fully realizes the difficult position he is in, because he will surely be found out by his men if he should return to his regiment. At this point he is like a leaf in a breeze. He has fallen from the main branch of the tree and the wind now takes him wherever it will. He is no longer in control of his own life. He does not know who he is or what his role in life is to be. It is the lowest point in his fortunes.
	The soldier who helps Henry back to his regiment is never named. Henry does not even see his face. Since Henry’s return to his own regiment is the beginning of his rehabilitation, the incident with the friendly, unnamed soldier suggests that even in the midst of this terrible situation, a kind of mysterious grace is operating in Henry’s life. He is to be given a second chance.
",The Red Badge of Courage
745,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 13-15,"Henry makes his way apprehensively to towards his old comrades. He fears the reception he may receive. The first soldier he encounters is his friend Wilson, who greets him warmly. He had assumed that Henry had been killed. Henry makes up a convincing tale about being separated from the regiment, being involved in terrible fighting, and getting shot. A corporal arrives and takes care of Henry. He dresses the wound and says it appears that Henry was grazed by a cannon ball. After the corporal leaves him, Henry sits on the ground observing the scene around him. Then Wilson arrives, and tries to help Henry by tying a wet, cool handkerchief around his swollen head. Wilson then gives Henry his own blankets, and will not listen to Henry’s protests about his generosity. Henry sleeps.
	He wakes in the morning and already there is a distant sound of battle. There are bugle calls and drum rolls. Wilson watches out for Henry’s needs as they gather around the camp fire for breakfast. Henry notices how much his formerly loud and aggressive friend has matured. He is quieter, more confident, less ready to quarrel. Wilson says the officers believe they have the rebels where they want them. He adds that he thinks they gave the opposing army a defeat the previous day. Henry replies that from where he was, it looked the other way round. Then he remembers Jim Conklin, and tells Wilson about his death. A quarrel springs up between three soldiers, and Wilson goes across to become the peacemaker. When he returns he comments to Henry that initially he had thought the regiment had lost half its men in the battle. But it turns out they had only been scattered, and were wandering around or fighting with other regiments. Most of them had now returned.
	Henry remembers the package Wilson gave to him, when the latter had spoken with self-pity about what he believed would be his imminent death in battle. But he decides not to give the package back to Wilson straightaway. He fears that at some point Wilson will expect Henry to tell him his adventures of the previous day, and the truth may come out. He realizes that his possession of the package gives him some power over Wilson, so he resolves to keep it. If anyone will be the subject of derision, he determines it will be Wilson, not himself. Now he considers himself safe from discovery, his self-confidence and self-respect return. He does not fear what may happen in the forthcoming battle. He again reassures himself that even though he had fled the previous day, he had done so with discretion and dignity, not like the other deserters. As Henry thinks these thoughts, Wilson approaches him, and in an embarrassed way asks for his package back. Henry does not make it difficult for him, and congratulates himself on his generosity. He feels superior to his friend.
Analysis
	It appears from the comments made by the corporal, and later by Wilson, that the number of men from Henry’s regiment who ran from the battle was high. This is clear from the corporal’s statement that he thought at first they had lost forty-two men, but many of them are now returning. He does not draw the conclusion that the men deserted. Nor does Wilson, when in a separate incident he says to Henry: “Th’regiment lost over half th’ men yesterday. . . . I thought a’ course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep a-comin’ back last night until it seems, after all, we didn’t lose but a few.” He goes on to explain that the regiment had been scattered, and many of the men believed lost had in fact been fighting with other regiments—just as Henry had done.
	The irony here is rich. Not only does Wilson not doubt Henry’s story, it seems not to occur to him that the men who were scattered in fact deserted. Although the truth that some men in the regiment are cowards is plain, no one is willing to draw that conclusion. Of course, this is very convenient for Henry and plays a part in restoring his confidence. He guesses he will not be found out.
	The maturing of Wilson after the battle is notable. The experience has changed him for the better. He no longer has to prove himself and is a better man as a result. Henry is observant enough to note the change. It is ironic, then, that Henry maneuvers himself into a position where he can feel superior to Wilson. This is the incident with the package. The reader will hardly feel that Henry is justified in his attitude. Wilson may have had a moment of self-pity but at least he did his duty. But now it is he who feels shame rather than Henry, who is busy puffing himself up with images of his own superiority and imagining all the great war stories he will tell, with himself at the center, when he returns home to family and friends.
",The Red Badge of Courage
746,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 16-17,"Henry’s regiment marches to some trenches to relieve another group of soldiers. The noise of various skirmishes is loud. Guns are roaring. Rumors spread that their army has been defeated. The regiment then marches through the woods, as Henry complains loudly about the incompetence of the generals. He and Wilson agree that the regiment fights hard. Wilson says they do not have any luck, and Henry persists in blaming the generals. But after another soldier makes a sarcastic remark to him, he feels threatened and keeps quiet. The troops halt in a clearing in the woods. They know a battle is imminent, and the lieutenant berates his men for arguing too much. There is rifle fire from the thicket in front of the regiment. The battle is upon them.
	Henry fumes with rage and exasperation. He wants to rest, not fight. As he waits with his fingers on his rifle, he conceives a hatred for the enemy. As the battle gets underway, he is conscious only of this hate, and his desire to crush the enemy. He determines to hold his position whatever happens, and he fires his rifle with ferocity. He does not even notice when there is a lull in the battle. He stands alone, still firing. When the smoke clears he sees that the ground ahead of him is deserted. The enemy has retreated. The lieutenant offers him high praise, and his comrades look admiringly on him as a “war devil.” When Henry reflects on what has happened, he is struck by how easy it was for him. He had fought like a beast, and become a hero. But he knows nothing of how it had all happened. As for the other men in the regiment, they are jubilant, and celebrate their victory with pride.
Analysis
	Henry continues to discover more about himself. Earlier, after long pondering the question of how he would react in a battle, he had found he was capable of an act of cowardice. Now, he shows he is also capable of acting courageously. He is so intent on the battle that he loses all sense of danger and is barely conscious of what he is doing. He discovers for himself the truth of what he had been told before he had ever tasted combat: “The youth had been taught that a man became another thing in a battle. He saw his salvation in such a change.” This reflection comes in chapter 3, just before the battle in which Henry runs away. As a coward, Henry was like a condemned man. Now, after his feats on the battlefield, he is like a man who has been saved.
	This section also marks the beginning of the bond that forms between Henry and the lieutenant. Earlier, Henry had regarded the lieutenant with distaste, as a crude man, quite the opposite of himself. But the lieutenant, whatever he may of thought of Henry, now regards him with admiration, saying that if he had ten thousand “wild cats” like Henry, he could win the war in less than a week.
",The Red Badge of Courage
747,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 18-19,"During the lull in their portion of the battle, Henry and Wilson go in search of a stream in order to find some drinking water. They do not find a stream and start to make their way back. They take the opportunity to observe the battle, which continues fiercely. They overhear the general of their division talking with another officer. The general fears the enemy will break through at a place called Whiterside, unless he can get reinforcements. The officer says he can spare none of his men except those of the 304th regiment, which is the regiment to which Henry and Wilson belong. The officer refers to them as “mule drivers,” because they were recruited from farms. The general approves the plan, and says as the officer rides off that he does not expect many of these “mule drivers” to return from the tough mission he has given them. Henry feels angry at the impersonal, indifferent way such things are decided. He and Wilson return to their regiment and give the news that they will shortly be asked to make a charge. The men are skeptical at first of how Henry and Wilson know this, but then they accept it. The officers bustle around, preparing the regiment for battle.
	The charge begins. Henry plays his part with fierce determination. The regiment takes many casualties as the battle intensifies, but the men continue to advance. After some while they tire and the advance halts. They continue to take casualties. The lieutenant and the other officers urge them forward again. They advance into withering fire from the enemy, and then halt again. The lieutenant bellows that they cannot stay there; if they do they will all be killed. He tries to force Henry to continue the advance. At first Henry protests, but then he, the lieutenant and Wilson rush on ahead of the other men. They urge the others to follow, and soon the whole regiment is on the move again, facing intense hostile fire. The sergeant who carries the flag is killed, and Henry and Wilson grab the flag from his corpse.
Analysis
	These chapters are full of insights into the strange, contradictory nature of war. Henry for example notes with distaste the impersonal, unfeeling way in which a general is willing to sacrifice men. He thinks they are being used just like brooms to sweep up the woods. No attention is paid to their humanity. And yet when the battle starts and the men advance, Henry feels an unusual sense of being fully alive. All his senses function in a very acute way. It is almost as if he is lifted to another state of consciousness, so clear does everything become:
It seemed to the youth that he saw everything. Each blade of the green grass was bold and clear. He thought that he was aware of every change in the thin, transparent vapor that floated idly in sheets. The brown or gray trunks of the trees showed each roughness of their surfaces (ch. 19, p. 119).
Henry also seems to comprehend everything about his comrades as they go into battle. And yet, curiously, he is also ignorant. He does not know why he is there. He is in a strange state of knowledge and ignorance at the same time, and he notes this condition in the other men too. They too find the situation incomprehensible, but they are caught up in a kind of group consciousness that lifts them beyond selfishness and makes them a formidable fighting force. Beyond the reach of reason, they are more like animals, acting instinctively.
	There is also great heroism in this horrific environment. Henry as well as Wilson emerge as men of great courage and leadership. There can be few moment in literature as moving as when the two of them wrest the Union flag from the dead sergeant. But the moment is also grotesque, as the description of the dead sergeant shows. This is a realistic war novel, not an exercise in sentimental patriotism.
",The Red Badge of Courage
748,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 20-22,"Henry and Wilson, as they carry the flag, are forced to retreat with the rest of the regiment. They fall back to the trees for cover. Then, with their ranks much depleted, they begin marching again. Once more they come under heavy fire. They become discouraged and feel betrayed by their officers. Henry is filled with anger against the officer who described their regiment as “mule drivers.” He and the lieutenant try hard to rally the men. But as the battle intensifies again, the regiment is in disarray. Henry, as the new color-bearer, holds the flag up firmly. Suddenly, the enemy is close and advancing upon them, step by step. Against all the odds, the Union soldiers beat them back. The men dance with joy. Their enthusiasm returns and they feel a new pride in themselves.
	In their part of the field there is a sudden stillness. The men feel free. They return to their own lines. Henry realizes that the distance they had covered was very small, and the battle must have lasted for only a short time. But he looks back with satisfaction at his own performance. He and the men then witness a confrontation between the officer who called them mule drivers and the colonel of the regiment. The officer says that if the men had advanced another hundred feet, it would have been a great effort. The colonel replies calmly that they advanced as far as they could. The officer rides away, and the lieutenant tells the colonel that anyone who says their men did not fight hard is a fool. The men are resentful at how the officer disparaged their efforts. Henry and Wilson discuss the injustice of it. Then another man brings some news. It turns out that when the colonel met the lieutenant, he wanted to know the name of the man who had carried the flag. After the lieutenant tells him, and praises Henry, the colonel says Henry is a good man to have. The lieutenant also has words of praise for Wilson. The colonel says they should both be major generals. When they hear this, Henry and Wilson are embarrassed, but secretly they are thrilled to be recognized and honored in such a way.
	In the lull in his regiment’s fighting, Henry takes the opportunity to observe the battles that are taking place elsewhere. Waves of troops engage each other in all directions. The noise is deafening. Then Henry’s own regiment is in action again, and performs with great valor. Henry is once again the standard-bearer. Casualties are high.
Analysis
	Henry’s experience has come full circle. When he first thought about war, as a young man before he even enlisted, his mind was filled with romantic, idealistic notions of glory. He imagined himself performing heroically in battle. Of course, when he enlisted, he found out that war was not such a glamorous adventure. He got bored marching for no apparent reason and sitting around in camps. War seemed the opposite of glory, and his former ideas foolish. Then of course came his moment of cowardice on the battlefield and his resulting confusion as he tried to live with the knowledge of how he had behaved when the pressure was on. He also had many thoughts about the insignificance and smallness of the individual in the face of such huge collective action as a war.
	But then, for reasons that Henry never fully understands, he
	genuinely becomes the hero he had once dreamed of being. He even discovers that the lowly infantryman is not always anonymous. His name is conveyed to his general, and he is praised by name. Now he can tell those war stories he imagined himself relating in chapter 15, when he had nothing at all to boast of, and they will be true. He really has been a “central figure in blazing scenes.”
",The Red Badge of Courage
749,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 23-24,"The officers call for a charge, and the men readily agree, even though the regiment has been severely weakened. They charge across a field toward a fence, behind which lies the enemy. Henry goes ahead with the flag, feeling joy and strength, and unconcerned about the bullets flying around him. He is in a kind of “wild battle madness.” Some of the enemy run; others hold fast. Henry sets his heart on capturing the enemy flag, but it is Wilson who accomplishes this task, immediately after the enemy standard-bearer is killed. The regiment drives the enemy back and takes four prisoners.
	The battle wanes. The men of Henry’s regiment march back to join the other Union forces. Their part in the battle is over. Henry reflects on his experience. He studies his successes and his failures. He rejoices in his feats of courage, and revels in the respect he has gained from his comrades. But he cannot forget his moment of shame, or the image of the tattered soldier deserted and left to wander in a field. He is haunted by this, and feels he may never forget it. But gradually he is able to put it behind him. He feels that as a result of the battle he has attained manhood. He looks forward to a more tranquil life.
Analysis
	The final charge is a stirring affair. The two armies are shown fighting at closer range than earlier; the struggle becomes more personal. As earlier descriptions have also shown, the individual soldier in battle is lifted beyond rational feeling into a realm of fanatical dedication. Henry feels like a “daring spirit of a savage religion-mad” (p. 141), and the men plunge on in an “exhibition of sublime recklessness.” The capturing of the enemy flag is a fitting climax to the battle, although the honor goes to Wilson not Henry.
	As a result of his war experience, Henry reaches a new maturity, just as Wilson had done earlier. He knows life is not all glory or shame, success or failure. It is a mixture. He has learned that he can redeem himself even after a grievous failing. He has also learned what it is to be a part of something bigger than himself. Although he felt joy in battle, he seems also to be aware that peace is more precious. Looking back on his experience, he views war as a “red sickness of battle,” a “sultry nightmare” which had turned him into an animal. He sees life more in a more balanced way now. The emphasis is on the “quiet manhood” he has attained, sturdy but not over-assertive. War has not corrupted him; it has made him wiser.
",The Red Badge of Courage
750,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"Plato begins The Republic by addressing the major theme of his entire work: should man be just or unjust? To discuss this issue, Plato (in the character of Socrates) uses a variety of surrounding characters to give their opinions. Yet he proves each of them wrong in turn. Later, he decides that an answer to the above question can be better found if he first defines the word justice.
	The opening scene begins in the home of Cephalus, where his son, Polemarchus, lives as well. Socrates, together with some of his friends, Glaucon and Adeimantus, enter into a conversation regarding aging. Cephalus tells Socrates that he enjoys his old age, citing his devotion to moderation and proper conduct. Soon the topic of justice flows from this conversation. This inspires Polemarchus and Thrasymachus to consider the nature of justice with Socrates. When Socrates criticizes Polemarchus' idea that man should spite his enemies, Thrasymuchus asserts that those with power have a monopoly over justice- they determine it as they see fit, despite the protests of the powerless. It's the duty of the poor, Thrasymuchas says, to rise up and take what they can from the rich. Yet Socrates attacks this viewpoint as well, saying that the poor should accept the true justice of the government, which is created to aid the governed. He goes on to say that justice is a kind of virtue, or excellence, which yields happiness. When all people accept justice, he maintains, all people can live happily in a cohesive community. Yet Socrates still seems to be seeking a better grasp of this notion of justice himself. Obviously this subject will be revisited throughout The Republic.
	Soon Glaucon presents his views to Socrates, asserting that man should pretend to be just but live unjustly in actuality. This way, he says, man can look virtuous before others without undergoing the toil of living a virtuous life. Socrates seems intrigued by this idea, and decides to use a model polis, or city, to better examine these notions of justice. This city has people who are divides into two classes: those who lead and those who serve. Here, Plato initiates his idea of philosopher kings-- the method in which a perfect city will be organized. The leaders of the city must be of a special breed, having incredible insight that protects the lower classes. They must not look out for their own interests, but live frugally, only considering the interests of the people. Limiting the freedom (or animal instincts) of the populace is crucial to instilling proper virtues. Also, the common laborers must be left in the dark on many issues, because any allusions to unjust living might inspire the people to also be unjust. Plato even says that the guardians can lie to the people if necessary. All forms of information, including literature and music, must be strictly regulated. Even a person's professional training must be carefully monitored by the state. In other words, the government forces its people to be virtuous. Free will is left out of the equation.
	Most importantly, the guardians must emulate the gods, since their special knowledge is divinely inspired. Here, Plato's suggestion seems startling similar to the Hebrew concept of monotheistic law, in which earthly kings maintain God's justice. This notion foreshadows Plato's idea of the Forms, which is discussed later in The Republic.
	Soon, Plato divides the class of rulers (or guardians) further. He asserts that the most senior philosophers should be the head guardians, while the others serve as assistants to these men. The guardians should live in a commune, where individual possessions are restricted. Plato believes that too much wealth will inspire greed and selfishness in the guardians, rendering them unable to rule objectively. Only a rigorous, state-run education system can wean off these animalistic qualities of the rulers, and help them make just laws- laws which mean to enhance the common good. True justice, Plato finally determines, is a result of each member of society doing the work prescribed for his social class. The work should not be done to grow rich, since riches corrupt men, leading them to greedy lives. Plato believes that a moderate amount of money will best suit the people to lives of virtue and justice.
",The Republic
751,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Next, Socrates considers justice on the individual level. Just as the model city is divided into classes, so is the human soul. One part of the soul is ruled by reason, another is ruled by spirit, and a third is ruled by appetite. The reason is derived from the wisdom of the wise elders, or philosopher-kings of the city. The other parts come from more base human instincts. Plato believes in moderation: each part should do its work, but not interfere with the other parts. This is of course parallel to the polis caste system, where class members are not suppose to intrude on the jobs of their superiors.
	Soon, Socrates decides to elaborate on his city of perfection. He continues his description of the communal life by saying that marital monogamy is prohibited. Plato believes that everybody belongs to everybody else. Here, we seem to be reading Huxley's Brave New World.
	To continue this strain, Socrates says that children will be taken by the government at a very early age, and the inferior babies will be left to die while the superior ones will be raised and educated by the government. In promoting this idea of ""one big family,"" Plato intends to break down barriers of class and race, so that the pursuit of virtue can be foremost on everyone's mind. Yet the most important reason for his ""social tampering"" is to ensure the genetic superiority of the ruling class.
	Also, Socrates expounds on his beliefs about war. He strongly discourages war between Greeks (i.e. Sparta vs. Athens) because he believes Greeks have a common identity and natural superiority as a single people. He also encourages the youth of the city to watch the battles to gain experience for future conflicts.
	Soon, Plato expounds on the ruling class. Here, he gets into his ideal of philosopher kings. As alluded to before, Plato asserts that only a philosopher can possess true knowledge, based on the insight of the Forms- unchanging, divine laws that exist in another, imperceptible reality. The true philosopher loves the Forms and finds his deepest satisfaction in discovering and administering them. Here, as stated earlier, Plato touches on the Hebrew idea of monotheistic law. Yet the Hebrews would certainly not accept Plato's Brave New World-ish Utopia.
	Next, Plato defends his philosopher-king idea. He does this by using the metaphor of a sea-faring vessel in which no leadership exists. While many good navigators exist, they are unable to steer the ship because other, more power-hungry individuals, assume control, despite their ignorance. Here, the philosophers are the skilled navigators who never get an opportunity to lead, due to their distaste for politics. This, of course, is how Plato sees the city of Athens at this time.
",The Republic
752,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"In this section of The Republic, Plato begins his description of metaphysical good. Only the Forms, which possess true knowledge, identify this good. Therefore only philosophers (who understand the Forms) can know it. The rest of the population simply holds onto opinions-- imaginative ideas founded in often faulty observation. Soon, Plato illustrates these ideas with the metaphor of the cave. Briefly, this metaphor takes place in a dark cave where everyone is forced to look at one wall. This wall possesses shadows created by puppets in front of the sun, which is the backdrop to the scene and illuminates everyone in its grasp. The sun helps those who feel it to remember the knowledge they have forgotten. The philosopher is the person who escapes the cave and learns to see objects, not as shadows, but as they really are. Thus these gifted philosophers understand true goodness through education and knowledge of the Forms. In this way, Plato answers the ridicule many philosophers receive for seeming disconnected from reality. Indeed they are disconnected from the reality of the shadows- they know a deeper reality-that of the sun.
	Next, Plato details his ideas about the varieties of government, and what causes them to change forms. He says that oligarchy becomes democracy when the upper class becomes motivated by money instead of virtue. Then, the lower class becomes poverty-stricken, causing them to rebel. Plato continues, ""And when the poor win, the result is a democracy."" Since a democracy is little more than anarchy, where man's evil appetites reign supreme over his virtue, the cornerstone of a just society collapses. Soon a strong leader emerges from this chaos, and a dictatorship begins.
	Toward the end of The Republic, Plato addresses the immortality of the human soul. It is this eternal life that makes it possible for humans to learn, since learning is nothing more than remembering knowledge from previous lives. He reasons (through creative rationale) that the soul can never die since it is not inherently evil in itself. He continues by giving a quite long-winded description of a purgatory-type system where the soul is forced to live for one millennium before being reincarnated into another body. Obviously this theory of immortality is quite different from the Hebrew or Christian concept.

Chapter1: Huck begins his narration, explaining that this story takes up where the previous one, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, left off: he owns six thousand dollars from the money he found in the cave, and this money he has given to Judge Thatcher, who is keeping the money and paying him interest. He lives with the Widow Douglas (who is trying to civilize him) because Tom won't let him join his ""gang"" otherwise.
	Restlessly lying in bed one night, he hears Tom Sawyer calling to him through the window, and the two escape together into the woods.
	Chapter 2: After playing a trick on Jim, Miss Watson's slave, Tom and Huck meet the rest of the boys in the woods. Tom tells everyone that to be in the gang, they must take an oath and sign their names in blood. If any one of them breaks the secrecy of the gang, however, his family will be killed. Since Huck doesn't really have a family, he tells the others that they may kill Miss Watson if he spills any secrets. As daylight approaches, the gang agrees to meet at a later date to go about the business of ""[robbing] somebody and [killing] some people.""
	Chapter 3: Huck briefly explains how he gave up the religion Miss Watson was trying to force on him and how his father was said to be drowned but that he didn't believe it. Next, he says that the gang has broken up, because they weren't doing any real violence, but just pretending. The comical scene of the Sunday School picnic, where Tom tells Huck that actually the schoolchildren are a procession of rich Arabs and their elephants, uncovers the differences between the two boys. Like Don Quixote, Tom is the idealist, while Huck is the realist who doesn't believe his friend's ""lies.""

Chapter 4: Huck explains that he has been going to school fairly regularly now, and that he doesn't mind it too badly. He also says that he's getting used to living with the Widow Douglas and her sister.
	In this chapter Twain continues to show Jim's belief in superstition and magic, as Huck says that the slave taught him quite a bit about the subject. He even tells Huck's fortune for him, telling him that his life will be filled with both joy and grief. Later, the reader will notice that Jim's magic signs often serve as foreshadowing for the future.
	Chapter 5: Huck's pap surprises him when he climbs into his bedroom window to confront him. The fifty-year-old man yells at his boy for getting an education, demanding that he quit school and give up ""religion"" immediately. It seems the old man is afraid that his son will know more than he does. What his father mainly wants, however, is to get his hands on Huck's six thousand dollars.
	Later, going before the judge, Huck's pap promises to change his ways, saying that he will become civilized and live decently. This cons the judge for awhile, but when the old man gets drunk the very same night, everyone realizes that there's no chance he will ever change.

Huck enjoys the freedom life in the wilderness affords him, noting that he took up cussing again since his father didn't mind.

One day after his father locks him in as usual, Huck leaves the cabin through his hole, goes hunting, kills a pig and brings it back. He spatters the blood all about and smashes in the door to the shack, making it look as if he's been murdered. He next gets into a canoe and paddles to Jackson's Island, a nearby, uninhabited wilderness area where he plans to hide for awhile. Ironically, Huck is able to live only by feigning his own death.
	Chapter 8: Hearing the noise of a cannon coming from a ferryboat traveling down the river, Huck immediately realizes that they are hoping to bring his body to the surface. The boat comes so close to the island that he can even see those he knows onboard as they scan the water for his corpse.
	Having stayed several days on the island now, Huck admits that he really enjoyed the freedom it gave him. He explains, ""I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say..""
	Soon thereafter, however, Huck encounters an acquaintance on the very same island, hiding, just as he is doing. This is Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Seeing the boy, Jim immediately falls to his knees, believing Huck to be dead and thus thinking that he is seeing his ghost. The two explain their stories to one another, and they agree to help each other escape. Huck admits that being with Jim made him feel less lonely.

Chapter 13: Getting into the rowboat that the murderers themselves were planning to get away in, Huck and Jim hurriedly hurl themselves into the little boat and finally get away from the whole fiasco. They find their raft further downstream as they pass a ferryboat with a watchman on deck. Huck, wanting to help the ""rapscallions"" who he and Jim had stranded, tells this man that he is from the wrecked steamboat (ironically named the Walter Scott) and that his family is still on board.
	Later, Huck thinks to himself that the Widow Douglas would be quite proud of him for helping the men, since these are the kind, according to her, that most need helping.
	Chapter 14: Looking through the supplies they had received from the wreck, Huck and Jim talk about the adventures they've just had. Through the course of the conversation, Huck admits that Jim ""had an uncommon level head, for a nigger."" This shows that some of Huck's assumptions about Jim are beginning to change.
	Next, perhaps the most comical scene in the book takes place as Huck and Jim discuss the nature of kings and dukes. Huck, who has read more about them in his books, explains to Jim that kings don't do any work, but still get to have as much of anything as they want. Jim's knowledge of kings is limited to ""King Sollermun."" The two have a humorous conversation about him, and this leads into a discussion of languages, Jim not understanding the nature of different languages. This all serves to show Huck that Jim, though he may have an ""uncommon level head,"" is incredibly ignorant and stubborn.

Chapter 16: Believing themselves to be close to freedom now, Huck begins to feel guilty for having helped Jim escape. Southern society has taught him that freeing a slave is a sin, and Huck starts to worry that he will go to hell.
	Being forced to postpone these thoughts for later, however, Huck is confronted by men who are looking for fugitive slaves. Wanting to search the raft for the slaves, the men begin to row out to it. Huck, however, ingeniously dissuades the men from such action by telling them that his father is onboard and has smallpox. Instead of helping, the men give Huck some money in charity.
	Later, now night, Huck and Jim jump overboard and are separated when a much larger vessel cuts their little raft into two pieces. Huck nearly drowns, but manages to reach shore, not having heard any sign of Jim.
	Chapter 17: Now on land, Huck walks a few paces before he hears a male voice yelling at him from a nearby house window. Apparently he has reached the Grangerford family headquarters. When asked who he is, Huck tells the man that his name is George Jackson and that he has just fallen off the steamboat. Taking him inside, the man examines Huck by candlelight, convinced that he isn't a Shepherdson, the name of the family with which the Grangerfords are feuding.
	The Grangerford family takes Huck in, and he admits that they were really nice. The ironic thing is, despite their obsession with feuding, the family seems to be very religious. Twain obviously uses this to further his indictment of religion.
	Chapter 18: Huck's education continues. He learns that the Grangerford family is practically part of the aristocracy. The other competing aristocracy in town seems to be the Shepherdsons. The families are feuding, Huck is told, because of some dispute that happened many years ago. When he asks what the nature of the dispute was, no one knows. All of this seems quite ridiculous to Huck.
	Soon word reaches the house that Miss Sophia, the beautiful daughter of the household, has run away to elope with a young man from the Shepherdson family. This immediately causes all the men of the house to fetch their guns and prepare for battle. Traveling with Buck, Huck himself sees the bloodshed first-hand.

They ask Huck if they can get away with them, and Huck agrees. Eventually the men announce to each other and to Huck and Jim that they are actually a king and duke, who have lost their kingdoms. Huck doesn't say anything, but he admits to the reader that he thinks ""these liars warn't no kings nor dukes, at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.""
	Chapter 20: Wondering about Jim, the king and duke ask Huck if he's a runaway slave. Huck is adamant in his denial, saying that they wouldn't be traveling south if he were a fugitive slave (They are forced to travel south now because of the current, which of course heads south on the Mississippi.).

	The Shakespeare show also takes place this night, but with only a meager turnout, the king and duke change their plan for the next night and put up signs around the town for a show called ""The Royal Nonesuch."" The real appeal of the show is the fact that women and children are prohibited from coming. This will surely cause some excitement, the duke proudly exclaims.
	Chapter 23: The first two nights of the Royal Nonesuch performance takes place in this chapter. What the show really amounts to is simply the duke walking onto stage and telling everyone that they have been duped and asks them to mention the show for the following two evenings to their friends. The people, who have each been conned into paying 50 cents for the ""show,"" are enraged and start to rush stage when one among them calls for them to stop, saying that they will be the ""laughing-stock"" of the town if they don't con their fellow citizens into buying tickets for the following two nights. Everyone agrees, and no violence is done to the king or duke at this time. The following two nights follow the same pattern, except on the third night the duke doesn't dare to enter the stage, knowing that the people plan to get their revenge on him this time. So instead, he and Huck run back to the raft, getting away with over four hundred dollars for the three ""performances.""
	The most important part of the chapter, however, is a conversation between Huck and Jim, when Huck realizes that Jim severely misses his family. This causes Huck to admit, ""I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n."" Thus, Huck continues to realize that Jim is as much a person as anyone else.
	Chapter 24: Meeting a fellow traveler, the king starts up a conversation with the man, finding out that the town is anticipating the arrival of the English brothers of Peter Wilks, a wealthy landowner who has recently died and thus has quite a sizable inheritance to give to his relatives. The king and duke jump on this opportunity, and after leaving the man who possessed such valuable information, ask for directions to the Wilks' home.

Chapter 25: They arrive at the house, pretending to be the brothers of the deceased, and they seem to fool everyone in the town. The king gives a speech, where he even brings himself to tears over the apparent death of his brother. One man, however, the family physician, doesn't believe that these men are genuine, but tells the town that they must be frauds. Their English accents, for one, don't seem quite authentic to his trained ear. Luckily for the king and duke, however, the town doesn't believe the doctor, but rallies behind them instead.
	Chapter 26: The king and duke, now in one of the Wilks' private rooms, plot their next move. A bag of gold has come into their possession and they decide to hide it for safe-keeping. Huck, however, feels guilty and partially responsible for the scheme, since he is with the king and duke. He decides to hide the gold himself to prevent the king and duke from getting their hands onto it.
	Chapter 27: Now with the bag of gold, Huck proceeds to find a place to hide it. Unfortunately, someone is heard approaching from another room, and fearing that he will be caught with the bag in his hand, he is forced to hide the gold in the casket itself.
	Soon the funeral ceremony takes place, and though many people are near the casket, no one seems to discover the gold.
	Planning their getaway, the king and duke realize that the gold is no longer where they had hidden it. They interrogate Huck about the matter, but they ultimately come to believe that some of the house slaves must have stolen the gold.

Chapter 28: In this chapter Huck meets with Mary Jane, one of the Wilks girls with whom he has become especially close, and he tells her that the king and duke are frauds and that he has taken the money from them. He writes a note to her telling her where he has hidden the gold.
	By the end of the chapter, real trouble for the king and duke has come with the arrival of the legitimate heirs. It seems a confrontation will soon follow.
	Chapter 29: To make a long story short, there's a lengthy dispute between the two pairs of heirs. As time passes, however, it becomes increasingly clear that the king and duke are frauds. All of the tension comes to a fountainhead at the burial of Peter Wilks, where the gold is discovered.

Chapter 31: After traveling south for a few days now, the schemers begin to plot secretly.Huck becomes nervous.Coming back to the raft a few hours later, he realizes that Jim is gone, and suspects that the king and duke have sold him back into slavery.He quickly learns from a boy from the town that Jim has been brought to Phelps farm, which is nearby.
	Huck returns to the wigwam to think, considering whether or not to send a letter to Miss Watson telling her Jim's whereabouts. He ultimately decides against this, believing he will be the laughing stock of the town for helping a slave escape.He also considers how wicked he has become, thinking that he must be surely damned for such actions. He accepts this fate, however, believing that he's going to hell anyway so he might as well help his friend, Jim.
	Thus, Huck begins to walk towards the Phelps' farm. On the way, however, he encounters the duke, who is putting up a flyer for another Royal Nonesuch performance. The duke blames the king for selling Jim, saying that he took all the money for himself. He tells Huck that Jim is forty miles away, making up a story to get rid of the boy. Of course Huck realizes that he's being lied to, but he pretends to follow the duke's advice, starting off right away towards the place the duke has directed him. Once out of sight, however, Huck heads directly towards the Phelps' house.
	Chapter 32: Huck approaches the farm, not knowing what he will say, but just trusting Providence ""to put the right words in [his] mouth."" Soon he realizes that they are expecting someone, and eventually he realizes that they are anticipating the arrival of one Tom Sawyer. Since they haven't seen Tom in many years, they assume that Huck is him. This sudden turn of fortune delights Huck, who willingly assumes the identity of his best friend and eagerly answers all their questions about the family he knows so much about.

Walking on the road back into town, he reunites with his friend, who can't believe that he is actually alive. He grudgingly admits to Tom that he's been trying to free Jim from slavery. Surprisingly, Tom says that he will help him free Miss Watson's slave. This stupefies Huck, who believes Tom to be a ""civilized"" boy who knows right from wrong.
	Reaching the Phelps' farm himself, Tom assumes the identity of Sid, his older brother, and explains the circumstances that bring him to visit too.

",The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
767,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part First: At Marygreen,"I–1 

	The novel opens in the hamlet of Marygreen, in North Wessex. A schoolteacher, Phillotson, is packing to move to Christminster (the fictional town based on Oxford) to pursue a university degree. His departure saddens the novel’s main character, eleven-year-old Jude Fawley. Jude suggests that Phillotson store his piano at Jude’s great-aunt’s home; Phillotson gives Jude a book and tells him to be good, read, and find him if he ever comes to Christminster. Jude decides that his teacher is “too clever to hide here any longer—a small sleepy place like this.” He goes to fetch water for his great-aunt Drusilla Fawley, the village’s baker. 

	 

Analysis

	Jude, the novel’s main character, is introduced as a sensitive, thoughtful child with dreams that far exceed what the village of Marygreen can offer. His admiration for his schoolteacher is deep and inspires him to consider himself a future scholar, at a time when university study was the privilege of the wealthy and well-connected.

	 

I–2

	Drusilla and other villagers discuss Phillotson’s departure. Drusilla explains that she has taken Jude, an orphan, in. Jude feels “the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face.” Drusilla worries that Jude is “crazy for books”; perhaps he should have gone with his teacher. She mentions that his cousin, Sue, is also bookish, and warns Jude never to marry because the Fawleys are failures in marriage.

	 

	Jude goes to his job as a living scarecrow in Farmer Troutham’s fields, shaking a rattle to frighten birds away from the crops. But Jude feels sympathy for the birds—“Puny and sorry as those lives were, they much resembled his own.” Troutham catches Jude letting the birds eat and beats the boy. Jude objects that Phillotson told him to be kind to birds, which makes Troutham angrier. The farmer pays Jude for the day and tells him not to return.

	 

	Worried about his aunt’s reaction, Jude dawdles going home. He steps gingerly around worms on the path. At home, his aunt scolds him as worthless and underfoot. Disheartened, he lies in the pig sty, wondering how “mercy to one set of creatures” can be “cruelty towards another.” After a while, Jude recovers his good spirits and helps his aunt in the bakery. The chapter ends with Jude staring down the road that leads to Christminster.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter continues to reveal Jude’s character: a super-sensitive and thoughtful child, gentle in nature and desiring to please, “the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal” before death cures him. His aunt, practical and gruff, cares for him and tries to advise him well.

	 

I–3

	The road to Christminster seems to Jude to lead to the sky. He asks two men at work on a roof where Christminster is. One worker replies that one can sometimes see its lights at sunset. After the workers leave, Jude climbs the ladder to the roof and looks to the mist-covered horizon, hoping to see the town that he imagines is like “the heavenly Jerusalem.” 

	 

	After this, Jude often tries to glimpse Christminster in the distance. The town acquires “a hold on his life” because of his fondness for Phillotson and for books. One day he asks a passing carter about the town, but the carter says that Christminster is no place for Jude: “’Tis all learning there—nothing but learning, except religion. And that’s learning, too.” The carter reports that the scholars make good money and that there’s music everywhere, reinforcing Jude’s desire to see “the city of light” where “the tree of knowledge grows” and where, with time and effort, he might “set himself to some mighty undertaking.”

	 

Analysis

	Jude’s growing fascination with Christminster is clear in this chapter. He imagines that, when the wind is right, he breathes the air that has passed through the town’s streets; he feels the town calling, “We are happy here!” Readers may sense that Jude’s fantasies of Christminster are so bright and lovely that the real town would disappoint him.

	 

I–4 

	Jude runs into Vilbert, “an itinerant quack-doctor,” traveling to Marygreen. Since Vilbert has often been in Christminster, Jude asks him about the town. Always ready to make money, Vilbert offers to sell Jude his old Latin and Greek grammars if Jude will hawk his medicines. For two weeks, Jude does so happily. But when Vilbert returns to Marygreen, he has forgotten about the grammars. Jude cries, realizing “what shoddy humanity the quack was made of.” 

	 

	Meanwhile, Phillotson has sent for his piano. Jude decides to write his former teacher and ask for some old grammar books. He tucks his letter in the piano. Weeks later, the books arrive, and Jude is thrilled, until he discovers what hard work it will be—“a labour like that of Israel in Egypt”—to teach himself Latin and Greek, the languages of scholars. 

	 

Analysis

	By this point in the novel, readers notice how often allusions to biblical people, places, and events occur in Jude’s thoughts. Jude is still a young child, yet his thoughts, though naÔve about reality, are expressed in sophisticated literary language. Jude certainly seems intelligent enough to succeed in scholarship. Yet no one in Marygreen encourages his interest “because nobody does.”

	 

I–5

	As the years pass, Jude assists his aunt in her prosperous bakery. Jude teaches the horse the delivery route so that he can read as he makes rounds. He’s starting to understand Latin and Greek, but he has time to study only while he’s driving, despite the risks this poses on the road.

	 

	By the time he is sixteen, Jude knows enough Latin to recite poetry, but he worries that he is reading only “heathen works,” not fit for Christminster, “that ecclesiastical romance in stone.” So he decides to work on the Greek New Testament rather than on Homer’s epics and begins to plan how to get a living in Christminster. Christminster is full of stone buildings; so Jude apprentices himself as a stone worker. At nineteen, Jude moves to his own lodgings in the town of Alfredston and begins to make his own way in the world as a stone-cutter.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter presents Jude as an optimistic young man who believes he can achieve his dreams if he works diligently toward them. Yet beneath his optimism, readers sense his naivety; his idea of university study is so lofty that reality cannot help but suffer by comparison.

	 

I–6

	One day as Jude walks from Alfredston to Marygreen to stay at his aunt’s house for the weekend, his grand daydreams are interrupted when he is struck on the ear by “a soft cold substance.” Three young women are washing pigs’ intestines in the river by the road, to prepare them for cooking, and one has thrown a pig’s genitals at him to get his attention. This person is Arabella Donn, daughter of a pig breeder. She flirts with Jude, sucking in her cheeks to form dimples, and he “felt himself drifting strangely.” Arabella asks Jude to call on her the next day, and he agrees to do so. After he leaves, one of the girls, Anny, remarks that Jude is an easy catch.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter introduces a threat to Jude’s dreams of Christminster. Happy in Alfredston because he is making progress toward becoming a scholar, Jude still has trouble getting the books he needs to teach himself; yet he has learned Latin, Greek, and some mathematics on his own. Arabella’s choice of missile—a pig’s genitals—symbolically suggests that sexual desire may detour Jude’s careful plans.

	 

I–7

	The next day is Sunday, Jude’s day off. He plans to study a Greek New Testament he has just bought rather than visit Arabella, but then feels guilty that she’ll be waiting on him. Some force that “seemed to care little for his reason and his will” compels him to go—for just an hour.

	 

	When he approaches her home, Jude is shocked to hear her mother call, “Here’s your young man come courting!” As they walk, they talk “the commonest twaddle.” They stop in an inn for tea. Others there are surprised to see Jude with Arabella, but she laughs “the low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is winning the game.” They start back, arm in arm. Jude kisses her, and she takes him inside to meet her parents. When Jude goes home, the Greek letters on title page of his New Testament seem to look at him “with fixed reproach . . . like the unclosed eyes of a dead man.”

	 

	In the next days, Jude misses Arabella, against his will, while she treats their relationship like a business deal. Anny and Sarah, Arabella’s friends, advise her to seduce him and then, when pregnant, force him to marry her—“Lots of girls do it.” Arabella decides to try.

	 

Analysis

	Jude works hard, in this chapter, to deny his attraction to Arabella, keeping “his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself.” Yet she artfully draws him in so that he yearns for her physical presence while refusing to consider himself her lover. Readers may wonder whether the practical Arabella and the sensitive Jude will endure as a couple.

	 

I–8 

	One day as Jude is walking to his aunt’s house, he runs into Arabella, who is chasing escaped pigs. Jude assists her, and the two end up flushed and panting. Jude tries to kiss Arabella, who coquettishly slips away. He follows her “like a pet lamb,” but she eludes him. Worried that he has offended her, he goes on to Marygreen.

	 

	The next Sunday, Arabella arranges for her parents to be out of the house for the evening. She meets Jude to walk, as they usually do—he hasn’t studied in the weeks since they met. Then she invites him in. She shows him an egg she’s carrying nestled in her bosom, saying that it’s “an old custom . . . it is natural for a woman to want to bring live things into the world.” She slips the egg out and back in, teasing him; he chases her upstairs.

	 

Analysis

	Already, Jude, in his sexual yearning for Arabella, has put his plans to be a scholar on hold; yet he seems not to realize or admit it. That she has the power in this relationship is clear in the descriptions of the clueless Jude, who follows her flirtatious lead seemingly without caution.

	 

I–9

	Two months have passed, and Arabella is “waiting and wondering” when Jude will propose. When Jude tries to end their relationship, Arabella weeps and says that it is too late, implying that she is pregnant. Jude, shocked, agrees to marry her although it means a “complete smashing” of his plans. That night, Jude walks and thinks. He knows that Arabella is “not worth a great deal as a specimen of womanhood,” but he must do the right thing. 

	 

	Drusilla provides the bride-cake, “the last thing she could do for him, poor silly fellow”; Arabella sends some to Sarah and Anny, as thanks for their “good advice.” The couple takes a cottage where they can raise a garden and keep a pig. Arabella is convinced that Jude has “earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats,” as soon as she can persuade him to “throw aside those stupid books for practical undertakings.”

	 

	On their first night together, Jude discovers that Arabella’s long, dark hair is actually a hairpiece. This sickens him, but Arabella assures him that “the better class” uses such shams. 

	 

	A few weeks later, Arabella runs into Anny in town and admits that she was “mistaken” about her pregnancy. When she admits this to Jude, he passes from shock to silence. He thinks of the unjustness of their marriage, a “social ritual which made necessary a canceling of well-formed schemes involving years of thought and labour . . . .”

	 

Analysis

	In a single chapter, Jude tries to leave Arabella, agrees to marry her, learns unsavory facts about her, and comes to resent her. Readers may consider whether Jude is a victim, swept along by powerful personalities and rigid customs, or whether he chooses to let Arabella upstage his plans. The people of parish certainly think Jude a fool who, after all his studies, now “would have to sell his books to buy saucepans.” When the couple weds, the narrator injects a critique of the permanency of marriage: If love is not permanent, why should the legal bond be so? 

	 

I–10

	The time comes to slaughter the pig. Bad weather prevents Challow, the pig-butcher, from reaching the cottage, so Jude and Arabella undertake the task themselves. Jude is appalled. He fed this animal, and now he must kill it. He wants to kill the pig quickly so that it won’t suffer, but Arabella insists that the pig must bleed to death slowly so that its meat will be good. Soft-hearted Jude kills the pig quickly anyway, earning Arabella’s contempt; “There’s a waste, all through you!” she complains. Challow shows up late to handle the cutting, and Jude feels “dissatisfied with himself as a man,” even as he regrets the killing.

	 

	Later, as Jude walks to work, he passes a shed in which Anny and Sarah are talking about their advice to Arabella. Upset, he eats supper that evening with his aunt rather than going home. He arrives at the cottage to find Arabella working late to prepare lard; he doesn’t know that she was out earlier and thinks she’s been working all day. She complains that she needs money, and he retorts that apprentice’s wages are not meant to support a household. “Then you shouldn’t have had one” is her frustrated reply. Jude gently hints that he knows how she schemed to entrap him, but she defends herself by saying that the risk was hers. Jude corrects her: The risk is the woman’s if the man refuses to marry, but it is the man’s if he is honest and thereby entrapped.

	 

Analysis

	Jude’s distaste for his marriage is conveyed by a habit he has developed. When he walks to Alfredston, he reads as he goes so that he will not have to see the places that remind him of his courtship. He now feels the fool for having let Arabella lead him so easily to the altar.

	 

I–11

	The next morning, Arabella, working in the kitchen again, recalls the conversation of the night before and becomes angry. She takes out her anger on Jude’s “dear ancient classics”—his books—getting lard on them as she flings them to the floor. Jude responds by grabbing her arms so that she can’t touch more books; her hairpiece comes down, and she leaves the house in fury. She sees lovers going for a walk and tells them that Jude mistreats her. Jude wonders if he should “drag her in by main force,” but to what end? “Their lives were ruined . . . by the fundamental error of having based a permanent contract on temporary feelings” rather than on compatibilities that “render life-long comradeship tolerable.” 

	 

	Arabella blames Jude’s blood—the Fawleys, as everyone knows, are bad at marriage. Curious, Jude asks his aunt about this, and she tells him the truth about his parents. They couldn’t live together; his mother drowned herself, and his father left and never spoke of her again till the day he died. His uncle and aunt, Sue’s parents, fared little better. “The Fawleys were not made for wedlock,” Drusilla, herself single, claims. They hate “the notion of being bound to do what we do readily enough if not bound.”

	 

	On the way home, Jude tests the ice on a pond—but when it cracks, he leaps back. He doesn’t want to die, but he doesn’t know what he should do. Then it occurs to him: “He could get drunk . . . . He began to see now why some men boozed at inns.” At home, he finds not his wife but a note that reads “Have gone to my friends. Shall not return.” A few days later, a letter from Arabella informs him that he’s “a slow old coach” and that she’s going to Australia with her family to get a fresh start.

	 

	Later, Jude finds in a pawn shop a framed portrait of himself—his wedding gift to his wife, inscribed with his love. This kills whatever feeling for Arabella he had left in him. He buys the portrait and burns it. After news comes that the Donns have left for Australia, Jude is struck by all that has happened to him, and he still so young. He stands on the road to Christminster, near a mile stone on the back of which he earlier had inscribed “Thither J.F.→.” It occurs to him that although he had been “diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman,” he was now free to take up his studies again. Part First ends with Jude praying, in a better frame of mind.

	 

Analysis

	The inn where Jude gets drunk is the same place where he and Arabella took refreshment during their first walk. On the wall is a painting of Samson, the strong man, and Delilah, the woman who broke his strength. Jude’s knowledge of biblical stories means that the symbolism of the painting can’t escape him. He was strong in scholarly ambition till Arabella’s physical, legal, and financial demands stripped him of his dreams.

	 
",Jude the Obscure
768,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part Second: At Christminster," 

	 

II–1

	Three years have passed, and Jude, no longer an apprentice, is walking to Christminster. He has grown into “a young man with a forcible, meditative, and earnest . . . countenance. He’s learned that his cousin, Sue Bridehead, is in Christminster. His aunt’s photograph of Sue “haunted him” and gave him the nudge out the door to the town he has so often dreamed of. 

	 

	Jude looks over Christminster from a hill and then descends to the town and takes lodging in a suburb. Then, at night, he explores the town, looking at and even touching the old stone walls of the colleges. It strikes him as odd that “modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers.” Though Jude is alone, he is not lonely; he feels that the spirits of the wise men who have studied and taught here over centuries are with him. When Jude speaks aloud to these spirits, he attracts the attention of a police officer and decides it would be better to go to his lodgings and study. He falls asleep, book in hand, but wakes early determined to locate Phillotson and, more urgently, Sue.

	 

Analysis

	Jude’s first day in Christminster has a fantastic feel to it. Night shrouds the stone walls, and spirits of former scholars seem to swirl around Jude. His hopes of the town have not yet been tested against reality, and he imagines himself joining “the sons of the University.” Readers should keep the description of his first impressions of Christminster in mind as they read on.

	 

II–2

	Jude begins to seek work. He walks among the town’s buildings again, but in daylight they seem to him “pompous” and “barbaric,” the worked stones old and “maimed.” As the days pass, Jude works at day and continues to study at night. He is lonely, still outside “the palaces of light and learning,” yet feels too “raw and unpolished” to seek his former teacher’s company.

	 

	Jude’s aunt sends him a letter warning him not to seek out Sue. The letter hints at Sue’s workplace, a shop making Anglican goods, and Jude sees her there, working biblical words into soft metal—a virtuous task. He feels unworthy to speak to her. Because they’re cousins, he knows they will eventually meet. Yet he worries because he’s married and because they’re Fawleys. Already he is half in love with the idea of Sue, who becomes to him “a kindly star, an elevating power . . . a tender friend.”

	 

Analysis

	Jude’s sensitive nature is on full display in this chapter. His sense of communion with the buildings and history of Christminster and his delicate concern that he is unworthy of his former teacher’s friendship increase the burden of his loneliness. His feelings toward the cousin he does not even know approach worship. He seems to transfer his boyhood idolatry of Christminster to Sue. He “kept watch over her,” finding in her daily routine evidences of her virtuous nature.

	 

II–3

	On a Sunday, Jude goes to the church he knows Sue attends, just to see her. The text of the choir’s anthem asks how a young man can “cleanse his way,” which touches him deeply. He thinks that he has found “anchorage” in his idealized love for Sue. Yet he admits that he thinks of her sexually often. As the service ends, he carefully avoids Sue; but he begins to rationalize his feelings. Since he’s married, he thinks, he can be her friend and cousin safely. 

	 

	While walking in the countryside a few days before, Sue had met a man selling statuettes. She was drawn to and bought statuettes of Venus, goddess of love, and Apollo. She carried her “heathen load” back to the dormitory above the shop, where she must hide them—they seem “so very large . . . and so very naked.” When the house mistress, Miss Fontover, inquires about the wrapped figures, Sue lies, telling her that they are of saints.

	 

	Meanwhile, across town, Jude is reading the New Testament aloud in Greek.

	 

Analysis

	Readers begin to know Sue in this chapter, and they learn right away that she is not what Jude thinks she is. She doesn’t produce worship aids because she is pious; in fact, the saints and “everlasting church fal-lals” bore her. The statuettes of mythological gods both fascinate and frighten her. That the chapter ends with a mention of Jude reading the New Testament strengthens the ironic contrast between his expectations of Sue and her real nature.

	 

II–4 

	Jude enjoys the variety of available stone work. One morning he is at work in a church. He breaks from work, so that the noise doesn’t disturb a service, and sees that Sue is there with Miss Fontover. Impressed by what he takes to be Sue’s devotion, he avoids her and returns to work after the service. In fact, Miss Fontover has made her attend.

	 

	As the days pass, Jude thinks he could ease his loneliness, and perhaps his immoral infatuation for Sue, by getting to know his cousin. The nation’s law forbids him to love her, and he tries to pray, insincerely, “against his weakness.”

	 

	One afternoon, Sue calls at the stonemason’s yard while Jude is out on a project. When Jude gets home that evening, he finds a note from Sue to “her dear cousin Jude.” Word has reached her that he is in Christminster; why hasn’t he contacted her? She’d like to have known him, but now she is leaving town.

	 

	Panicked, Jude writes to Sue, and they meet. Jude says that she is his only friend in Christminster other than Phillotson. She’s heard of his old teacher; he teaches in a nearby village. “Then he couldn’t do it!” Jude thinks as his childhood idol is destroyed. They walk to Lumsdon to find Phillotson, who at first does not recall Jude. A “spare and thoughtful” man, Phillotson says that he gave up his dream years ago but likes teaching, though he needs a pupil-teacher. 

	 

	As they walk back, Jude realizes that he loves Sue, while she thinks of him only as her cousin. She explains that Miss Fontover found and destroyed the statuettes. Sue argued with her employer and now feels that she can no longer work for her. Jude suggests that Phillotson might take her on as a pupil-teacher.

	 

	The next evening, Jude presents “ingenious arguments” about why Sue would make a good assistant, and Phillotson agrees to take her on. Jude never lets on, and Phillotson never suspects, that he is more than a helpful cousin.

	 

	Analysis

	Jude is of two minds about Sue. He wants to love her purely and to have her be worthy of that love; and he desires her sexually and enjoys that desire. Jude tries to reconcile his opposing feelings by arguing that he doesn’t feel a mere animal lust for Sue, as he did for Arabella, but that he also desires her “intellectual sympathy.” Jude’s caution about this relationship is overturned, however, by a chance event when Sue learns that he is in town.

	 

II–5 

	Sue is now working as Phillotson’s pupil-teacher, living in an old house by the school. She’s bright, hardworking, “an excellent teacher.” Richard Phillotson tutors her in the evenings, chaperoned, of course, and begins to fall for her. One day they take the schoolchildren to see a traveling exhibit, a model of Jerusalem. Sue questions the accuracy of the model and complains that Jerusalem is not as important a city as Athens or Rome. Jude is there, too, and is clearly fascinated by the model, yet he defends Sue’s critique of the exhibit. She takes his hand in gratitude, without knowing how the two men feel about her or “what a complication she was building up thereby in the futures of both.” Jude agrees to call on Friday.

	 

	The next day, Sue draws the model in detail from memory on the blackboard, to Phillotson’s amazement. Later in the week, the school inspector visits and is impressed by Sue’s teaching. She, however, nearly faints afterwards and is angry that Phillotson didn’t warn her about the visit. But he praises her teaching, and she regrets lashing out at him.

	 

	On Friday, as Jude walks toward the school, Phillotson and Sue are leaving the vicarage under a single umbrella. When Jude sees Phillotson’s arm around Sue’s waist, he sinks “into the hedge like one struck with a blight.” Despairing, he thinks they are married or considering marriage—and he introduced them.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter reveals Sue’s impressive intellect and talents but also her unconventional (for that time) bias against religion. It also suggests that she has a blind spot when it comes to “reading” those around her. She has no idea that she is involved in a love triangle with two men, one unsuitable because he is married and the other because he is “too old for her,” as Jude says.

	 

II–6 

	Jude visits his sick aunt in Marygreen. She advises him about Sue: “Don’t you be a fool about her!” Drusilla recalls Sue as a child, “an odd little maid,” bright but impudent. Jude leaves, saddened. As he starts home, he speaks with a villager who tells him that Christminster is “not for such as you—only for them with plenty o’ money.” Their disagreement recalls Jude’s plans, which have again been sidetracked, to him. He needs a Greek tutor, someone inside the college who can advise him. He decides to write letters for advice to the five college luminaries whom he has seen in town and who look kind. As soon as he posts the letters, however, he regrets them.

	 

	Meanwhile, he hears that Phillotson is leaving Lumsdon to teach at a larger school, farther away. Jude wonders: Is Phillotson taking the new job so that he can afford to marry? 

	 

	Jude waits for replies to his letters but receives none. He considers trying for open scholarships, but it would take him fifteen years to prepare to compete. Despairing, he thinks he should have stayed away from Christminster—“the whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap-bubble, under the touch of reasoned inquiry.” He’s glad that his failure has not touched Sue.

	 

	At last a reply to his letters arrives, advising him to forget scholarship and to stick to “your own sphere.” Jude goes out to drink, feeling that this reply is “a hard slap after ten years of labour.” Standing at the Fourways, a road crossing in the town’s center, he becomes aware that the town’s life is not in the scholars but in the working people who keep the place running. As he goes home, he writes a verse from the book of Job in chalk on the gates of the college whose head had written him: “I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you.”

	 

Analysis

	In this chapter a place that Hardy uses as a symbol makes its first appearance—the Fourways, a crossroads in the middle of Christminster. As he stands at the Fourways, trying to decide what to do, Jude becomes aware of its rich history: “At Fourways men had stood and talked of Napoleon, the loss of America, the execution of King Charles, the burning of the Martyrs, the Crusades, the Norman Conquest, possibly the arrival of Caesar. Here the two sexes had met for loving, hating, coupling, and parting; had waited, had suffered, for each other; had triumphed over each other; cursed each other in jealousy; blessed each other in forgiveness.”

	 

II–7

	The next morning, Jude tries to resign himself to his destiny and thinks he could do so more easily if Sue were his. He goes to a tavern for distraction and stays all day, watching the diverse crowd, eavesdropping on other lives. He hears one group criticizing the dons (professors) of the colleges and joins in, drunkenly claiming that he could “lick ’em on their own ground if they’d give me a chance.” The workers around him challenge him to prove it by reciting the Creed in Latin. Jude takes the challenge, provided someone buys him a drink. After he recites the Creed, he feels disgust and shame for having used the church’s ancient words for such a purpose.

	 

	Jude, still drunk, goes to see Sue, who takes him in and comforts him. In the morning he awakes in her chair, ashamed that Sue “knew the worst of him—the very worst,” and flees back to Christminster, only to learn that he’s been fired. He packs and leaves for Marygreen, pawning some goods along the way and sleeping in a hayrick. Moving back in with his aunt, he feels that he is in “the hell of conscious failure,” both in his ambitions and in love. He hears a curate (pastor) praying by his ailing aunt’s bedside in the next room. The curate, Mr. Highridge, listens as Jude explains his failures and confesses that he most regrets the lost opportunity to serve the church. Mr. Highridge suggests that Jude enter religious study to become licensed to preach. But, he warns, Jude must stop getting drunk.

	 

Analysis

	Part Second culminates in the end of Jude’s old dreams of scholarship and the beginning of his new plan, to enter the church. Readers can pause at this point in the novel to consider an important question: How much of Jude’s failure—his marriage to Arabella, his exclusion from college life, his abuse of alcohol—is attributable to choices he made and actions he took, and how much is attributable to chance events in which he was caught up? In much of his writing, Hardy tries to sort out how much of a person’s destiny is under his control and to determine the role that fate has in driving a person toward contentment or despair.

	 
",Jude the Obscure
769,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part Third: At Melchester,"III–1 

	Having laid aside his dreams of scholarship, Jude now takes up the idea of noble self-sacrifice in service. Because he will not enter church work as a scholar, Jude will be limited to the career of “the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village of city slum—that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it . . . .” For “a long stagnant time,” however, Jude does nothing toward his new goal. Then a letter comes from Sue, telling of her plans to attend a Training College in Melchester. There is also a Theological College in Melchester, Jude thinks—perhaps he should move to this city, “a quiet and soothing place . . . where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no establishment.” Jude calculates the time he will need to read up divinity texts and thinks that he might enter the ministry at age thirty, “an age that much attracted him as being that of his exemplar [Jesus] when he first began to teach in Galilee.”

	 

	Jude plans to move to Melchester in spring, when seasonal stone work begins, but he receives a letter from Sue saying that she is “quite lonely and miserable” at Melchester, “utterly friendless” and chafing at the strict rules of the women’s training college. Jude goes. He is pleased to see that the cathedral is under renovation; there will be much work for him. Perhaps, he thinks, “a ruling Power” is favoring him. Jude finds a changed Sue at her lodgings: “she had altogether the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline,” but under the severity he perceives “brightness shining through from the depths.” He wishes he could kiss her.

	 

	Jude buys Sue dinner—in the training college, food is not plentiful. They hold hands, in chaste cousinly fashion, and Jude asks Sue if Phillotson had wanted to marry her. “If he had, what would it matter?” she replies. “An old man like him!” Then she admits that she has indeed promised to marry him after finishing her training; they will then teach at a larger school. She thinks that perhaps she and Jude should not see each other, but he claims his “perfect right” as her cousin to see her when he wants to. He suggests that they go sit in the cathedral, but Sue prefers the railway station: “That’s the centre of the town life now. The Cathedral has had its day!” He walks her to the college gate for curfew.

	 

	Jude quickly gets work and takes lodgings, spending too much so that he is near Sue. He studies theological texts in the evenings and practices the harmonium (a small organ) so that he will be able to lead hymns in a church.

	 

Analysis

	Readers know Jude well enough now to see that he rationalizes his decision to move to Melchester. His real intent in living there is to be near Sue, whom he hopes “to learn to love . . . only as a friend and kinswoman.” His decision is in fact irrational: He moves during the winter, when little stone work is available, because of Sue’s letter begging him to come.

	 

	 

III–2 

	Jude and Sue have planned a day out, and his sense of anticipation is high: “Every detail of the outing was a facet reflecting a sparkle” as long as Jude doesn’t stop to think that his time with Sue is contrary to his married state and his career plans. On the train, the guard thinks they are lovers and gives them their own compartment—“a good intention wasted,” Sue comments. They visit a castle to view an art display. They lunch and then walk in the country. Sue tires, and as there is no station nearby, they seek refuge in a cottage. Sue praises the rustic life, but Jude says she wouldn’t like it for long. They sleep separately, and the next day they walk the four miles to the train station. Sue fears that she will be in trouble for breaking curfew. She gives Jude a little photograph of herself, and he’s happy—but the porter who opens the college gate gives them “an ominous glance.”

	 

Analysis

	Jude and Sue seem to go together well; on their outing, they give the appearance of lovers. However, they are opposed on some serious issues, including that of religious beliefs. While they view the art, Sue is puzzled by Jude’s fascination with religiously-themed paintings: “It was evident that her cousin deeply interested her, as one might be interested in a man puzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had one’s self escaped.” 

	 

III–3

	Melchester’s Training College is “a species of nunnery” for the seventy girls who live and study there. When Sue misses curfew, they know she’s in trouble. Most of them doubt that Jude is in fact her cousin (and therefore a suitable guardian) because another girl has recently used that lie. As they go to bed at night, a mistress comes in to check Sue’s bed and notes two photographs on her dressing-table, one of Phillotson, another of a young man in cap and gown.

	 

	The next day, Sue is still missing, and the girls are instructed not to speak to her if they see her. So, when she comes in at last, she is ignored. For punishment, Sue is confined to solitary life for a week, a sentence the girls find harsh. They appeal the sentence and refuse to work in class, in Sue’s support, even after the mistress says that she knows for a fact that Jude is not Sue’s cousin. Toward dusk, the students hear that Sue has run away. The matron is worried—not about Sue, but about scandal attaching to her school. Secretly, she’s glad Sue is gone.

	 

	Jude is reading at his lodgings when he hears gravel on his window. Sue stands outside, in soaked clothes, needing shelter. Jude “palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to hear in his. What counterparts they were!” He leaves the room while she changes into his Sunday clothes. He buys brandy to warm her and watches her as she sleeps in a chair, seeing in her “almost a divinity.”

	 

Analysis

	Hardy is often thought of as a pessimistic writer, though he considered himself not a pessimist but a realist. In fact, one of Jude’s failings is his lack of realism. The “divinity” he sees in his chair is really a girl who hates restriction and flouts authority. Hardy’s description of the girls in the college gives an example of his unwillingness to look away from hard truths: “They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic sight, of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious, and would not discover till, amid the storms and strains of after-years, with their injustice, loneliness, child-bearing, and bereavement, their minds would revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently regarded.”

	 

IV–4 

	When the landlady comes up to Jude’s room, he hides Sue’s clothes and sits down to read. She assumes that a gentleman is visiting and brings dinner on a tray. Sue wakes up, having missed curfew again. Jude implores her to stay, rest, and eat so that she doesn’t get sick. As they talk, Sue complains that Jude called her a “creature of civilization” while they were at the cottage. This is “provokingly wrong”—she is “the negation” of that. She lists what she’s read and asserts that she has “no fear of men . . . nor of their books.” She reveals that she was close friends with an undergraduate at Christminster; he loaned her books, and they went “on walking tours, on reading tours” as if they were both men. Indeed, that is the relationship Sue assumed they would have when they went to London to share lodgings, but she learned that he expected her to become his mistress. When Sue threatened to leave, he agreed to live chastely with her. He later became ill and went abroad for his health, but he came home to die. She admits that she broke his heart. He left her a little money, which she invested but lost; then she came to Christminster to find work because her father would not take her in. Jude remarks in admiration that Sue is “as innocent as you are unconventional.” 

	 

	Jude notes that it’s time for prayers and asks Sue to join him. She declines and criticizes Christminster’s reputation as a place full of “fetishists and ghost-seers,” where intellect and religion push so hard against each other that neither makes progress. Jude prays and reads the Bible while she waits. She offers to make him a New Testament like hers, “cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into separate brochures,” then arranging them in order of composition. Jude declares this sacrilege, but Sue continues to criticize accepted interpretations of scripture.

	 

	As they argue, Sue admits that she had hoped to “ennoble some man to high aims” and thought that Jude might be that man; but his willingness to “take tradition on trust” makes her think otherwise. Then, aware that she has offended, Sue says that they must “never, never vex each other”; her voice seems to “nestle in his breast.” They think alike in many ways, she says, but they can never be “comrades” because of his sexual desire. 

	 

Analysis

	Sue’s backstory is in sharp focus in this chapter, and it doesn’t suggest that Jude will  live “happily ever after” with her. She seeks intellectual companionship and has found it only in men, yet she is sexually unavailable and knows that men are not often content to stay in a relationship that has no sexual component. It’s possible that she intends her arguments to discourage Jude from loving her, but they have the opposite effect.

	 

	 

III–5 

	In the morning, Sue must leave Jude’s lodgings unseen. She now regrets running away because of what Phillotson will say. She decides to stay with a friend till the event blows over. Jude walks her to the station, wanting to tell her that he loves her, but she objects: “You mustn’t love me. You are to like me—that’s all!”

	 

	Melchester is dismal for Jude without Sue nearby. She writes to let him know she’s safe and apologizes for her curtness at the station: “If you want to love me, Jude, you may.” He writes back but, receiving no reply, worries that Sue must be ill and makes the eighteen-mile journey to check on her. He finds her in bed with a cold, but that is not why she didn’t write. She’s been expelled; the matron has advised her to marry Jude to save her reputation. She blames herself for getting close to him; she blames him for not demonstrating his love more openly. Jude wants to kiss and comfort her, but he holds back, knowing that he should tell her about Arabella. Instead, he asks what Phillotson thinks about her being expelled.

	 

	The next day, back at his lodgings, Jude receives a letter from Sue. She apologizes for her bad temper and says that she will see him when she comes to get her belongings.

	 

	Analysis

	This chapter includes two examples of a behavior that Sue often engages in and that causes Jude grief. In person, she speaks bluntly, or cruelly, or angrily; the next day, she sends a letter retracting or apologizing for her words. Jude, because he idealizes her, tends to take her spoken words too lightly and then to read too much into her letters. Any warning against hope that Sue intends to convey is drowned out by her follow-up letters. Readers may wonder who is more conflicted about this friendship—Sue or Jude.

	 

IV–6 

	While Sue is at Melchester, Phillotson is teaching at a larger school in Shaston, saving his money for their marriage. He thinks often of Sue’s beauty. In his spare time, he researches Roman-British antiquities, but he spends most of his writing hours studying Sue’s letters and her photograph—the same that she gave to Jude “and would have given to any man.” Though gray, old-fashioned, and approaching fifty, he kisses the photograph like “a young man of eighteen.”

	 

	One Saturday—the same day Sue comes to get her belongings—Phillotson travels to Melchester to visit her, only to learn that she was expelled two weeks ago. Angry at the school, Phillotson rests in the cathedral and sees Jude at work. Jude explains what has happened, aware that he could use this chance “to annihilate his rival” by saying that the scandal is true. But he doesn’t. He admits that he would marry Sue but explains why he can’t. They part, Phillotson satisfied that Jude and Sue are not lovers.

	 

	Jude sees Sue in the street and goes to meet her. He asks if she has seen Phillotson, but she won’t be “cross-examined” by him. Put off, Jude remarks that Sue’s letters are often nicer than she is. Jude finally tells Sue about his marriage as they walk in the closed market, discarded produce underfoot. Feeling angry and foolish, she cries, “O it is perfectly damnable how things are!” Something of her true feelings for Jude shows when she asks how pretty Arabella is.

	 

	Jude expresses his fear that Arabella will return to England one day, but Sue is too angry to sympathize. She calls him a hypocrite who prays to the saints while loving where he should not. Both are miserable; then Sue confesses that she’s hurt not because she loves Jude but because Jude didn’t trust her with the facts right away. Not that it matters—they couldn’t marry because they are cousins and she is engaged, but they can still be friends. At the end of the conversation, Jude feels very unsure of Sue’s opinion of him.

	 

	Analysis

	By now, readers sense that while Jude is so devoted to Sue that he will endure any abuse or neglect, she herself is divided about her affections. As the cousins list reasons they can’t marry, they consider the Fawley reputation but dismiss it as superstition. Yet Sue at least is so inconsistent—promising to marry Phillotson, claiming not to love Jude yet feeling betrayed by his marriage—that it’s hard to imagine a successful marriage to her. She may indeed be an example of the Fawley curse.

	 

III–7

	A few days later, Sue sends a letter that “passed across Jude like a withering blast” because it announces her imminent marriage to Phillotson. “Wish me joy,” she says, signing herself Susanna Florence Mary Bridehead. Jude can’t eat and goes to work feeling that “everything seemed turning to satire.” He wants to warn Sue: “You don’t know what marriage means.” In the end he determines to “play the Spartan” and support her, since he can’t marry her. Another letter comes—Sue wants Jude to give her away, since her father won’t and, by tradition, a male relative should. He offers his help and his lodgings but asks her not to sign her letters so formally if she still cares for him.

	 

	Jude moves to larger lodgings, renting a room for Sue to stay in during preparations. They rarely see each other during the weeks she’s there, but on the morning of the wedding, they have breakfast together. He wants to lash out about the wedding but restrains himself; she gabbles in an uncharacteristic fashion. They run an errand together, and she takes his arm, which she’s never done before. In her “curious trick of tempting Providence at critical times,” they pass the church where she will wed. Sue wants to go in and see “where I am so soon to kneel and do it.” They walk up and down the aisle, arm in arm; Jude is close to breaking down with the thought that he is helping his beloved make the mistake he made with Arabella. “Was it like this when you married?” she asks. “Don’t be so awfully merciless!” he responds. 

	 

	As they go out, they meet Phillotson, who watches in surprise as Sue pulls her arm away from Jude’s and explains that they were rehearsing. Jude leaves to buy a wedding gifts and leaves. Later, as they prepare for the ceremony, Phillotson’s love for Sue is clearly in his face; he looks like a man who “would make a kind and considerate husband.” Sue, by contrast, looks as if she feels unworthy of him. As they take a carriage the short distance to the church, Jude presents his gift: a length of lacy veil, which he throws over Sue’s bonnet, wondering why Sue is willing to put him through this ordeal. Indeed, Sue nearly breaks down when Jude gives her away.

	 

	After the ceremony, the couple has dinner at Jude’s lodgings and then departs. Sue looks back, frightened, as she goes to the carriage. She runs back into the house for her handkerchief, eyes full of tears, and seems to want to speak to Jude but doesn’t. As the carriage pulls away, Jude wonders: Did Sue marry Phillotson to punish him for keeping his secret so long?

	 

Analysis

	This chapter is full of pathos. Readers know that, even if Jude and Sue cannot marry, neither wants her to marry Phillotson. The “rehearsal” in the church is the only part of the day that Sue enjoys, yet as if to punish herself, she brings up Jude’s wedding. Yet Phillotson apparently doesn’t notice Sue’s nervous state, or he attributes it to the feelings any bride has. As the chapter ends, readers may wonder how any of the three can hope for a happy outcome.

	 

III–8 

	After the couple leaves, Jude wonders whether Sue left her handkerchief behind at all. Perhaps she really wanted to speak to him. He changes and goes to work but keeps thinking that he hears her voice, that she has come back. “Her actions were always unpredictable: why should she not come?” In the evening, he imagines her on her way to London, then thinks of her future as a wife and mother. The next days are awful for Jude, and to his grief is added his aunt’s serious illness. His employer in Christminster has asked him to come back to work, so, eager to leave the misery of Melchester behind and to be nearer to his aunt, Jude moves back to Christminster. Jude writes Sue that Drusilla is indeed close to death and offers to meet her at the Alfredston station if she wants to visit her.

	 

	Jude finds that he no longer feels anything for Christminster—neither awe nor hope nor disappointment. He moves back into his old lodgings, but everything reminds him of Sue. One day he runs into another stone worker, Tinker Taylor, who invites him to go drinking. Taylor leaves the inn after a drink, but Jude stays. He watches a party of undergraduates in the next booth and realizes that the woman flirtatiously waiting on them is Arabella. Yes, she’s married, Arabella tells the young men—but not to worry, because her husband is in Australia. 

	 

	Jude approaches Arabella, who thought he had died. Had she known he was in Christminster, she says, she might have stayed away. She won’t say why she’s back in England, but she does say that she made up the husband in Australia, because it’s easier than explaining her situation with Jude. Arabella is content with the way things are: “I make a very good living, and I don’t know that I want your company.” Yet she asks him to talk with her after work. To do so, he must give up meeting Sue, but he must find out what Arabella’s return means. 

	 

	After work, Arabella and Jude walk. He tells her about his aunt and about Sue, but she is less revealing. They go by train to a nearby town, where they’re not known, and spend the night in a hotel.

	 

Analysis

	Arabella is shown in this chapter not to have changed much since her teen years. She is conniving and calculating, always angling for a deal that’s a little better than the one she has. Readers must question her motivations. For example, she says she’ll go with Jude to visit his ailing aunt, but she “had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him.” Her game is to find out how Jude is doing financially and decide if he’s worth taking to husband again.

	 

III–9 

	The next morning, Jude and Arabella return to Christminster, and she reveals that she does indeed have a husband in Australia, a hotel manager. Now this man is talking of coming to England. Jude looks “pale and fixed”; he wants to know why she didn’t tell him this last night. He says that the second marriage is a crime, but Arabella claims that such marriages are common in Australia. As they part, she says she’ll let Jude know what she decides about him. 

	 

	It’s too soon for Jude to catch the train to Alfredston, so he stands at the Fourways, with a look on his face of “one accurst.” In this state, he hears Sue’s voice calling him. She stands before him, looking “bodeful and anxious as in a dream . . . her strained eyes speaking reproachful inquiry.” Both look away as she fights tears. Then they hold hands and walk. Sue has spent the night by their aunt’s side and now has come to Christminster to find Jude. He comments that now they are both married, but she cuts the subject off by asking “Where did you stay last night?” Jude dodges her innocent question; although he wants to tell her about Arabella’s return, he worries that the information might harm his wife. 

	 

	As they travel to Marygreen, Jude inquires after Phillotson, but Sue’s answers are vague. Jude murmurs that “Wifedom has not yet squashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no further individuality” as being a husband has done to him. He tries to lead Sue to admit unhappiness, but she will not. Her husband is “good and kind.”

	 

	Drusilla, tired of being in bed, is up and about. She tells Sue that she will “rue” her marriage because Phillotson is not the right man for any woman. Sue flees the house, and Jude finds her in the shed, crying. Their aunt is right, she says—she should not have married. As Sue leaves that afternoon, Jude asks if he may visit her. She puts him off and leaves. Over the next days, Jude tries “mortifying by every possible means” his desire to see Sue, fasting, praying, and studying scripture. A letter comes from Arabella: Her husband has come to England to open a new pub, and she is going to assist him. She wishes asks Jude not to reveal their marriage.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter allows Jude, and readers, to compare Arabella and Sue. As he feels disgust at his “revived experiences” with his wife, Sue appears before him, “so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs,” and he feels “heartily ashamed of his earthliness” with the fleshy, florid, pragmatic Arabella. Yet Jude knows where he stands with Arabella and what she wants of him, while Sue’s nature and desires are a mystery.

	 

III–10 

	Jude returns to Melchester, which is perilously close to Shaston, where Sue now lives, because he finds Christminster unbearable and thinks that living closer to Sue might give him a chance of “worsting the Enemy.” He studies “with feverish desperation” and worries that he is “a man of too many passions to make a good clergyman.” To pass the time, he practices church music and sings in a choir. One day they practice an anthem that moves him deeply. He believes that the composer must have insight into spiritual questions, so, “like the child that he was,” he spends time and money he can ill afford to travel to the man’s house. He follows the man to his house—“A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!”—and tells him how much the music has meant to him. The composer launches into a complaint: The anthem has been well received, yes, but publishers won’t pay fairly for it. “Music is a poor staff to lean on,” he says; he is giving it up to sell wines. When he sees that Jude is poor and no customer, he’s done speaking to him.

	 

	Depressed and feeling foolish, Jude goes home, where a “contrite little note” from Sue, inviting him to dinner that day, awaits him. Jude wonders if his journey to the composer’s home was a “special intervention of Providence” to keep him from temptation, but he balks at thinking of God in this way. He writes to Sue to explain his absence and offers to come any day. They plan to visit on Thursday after school.

	 

Analysis

	As the novel proceeds, Jude finds that many sources of support are, as the composer says, “a poor staff to lean on.” The law traps him in an unwanted marriage. Christminster rejects him as a scholar. His religious studies don’t help him negotiate his love for Sue, and the mentors he looks to disappoint him. As Part Third ends, Jude seems at a loss for how to navigate through his problems.
 
",Jude the Obscure
770,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part Fourth: At Shaston," 

IV–1 

	This section of the novel begins with a description of Shaston, a town once prominent but now merely picturesque. It is an overwintering spot for caravans of itinerant workers and entertainers. Phillotson is out of town at a teacher’s meeting, and Jude arrives before school is out; he is at the piano, idly playing the anthem, when Sue enters and urges him to keep playing. She plays, too, and their hands touch. He tells her about meeting the composer as she makes tea in the schoolroom, because she finds her house “antique and dismal,” heavy with the “weight of so many previous lives.” She points out the kettle, a wedding gift from Jude that “sang with some satire in its note.” They talk about editions of theological texts, and Sue asks whether Jude will be working on the restoration of a church where she could visit him. He says that they can’t be friends as they were before, and she trembles. “Sue,” he accuses, “I sometimes think you are a flirt.” Offended and flushed she leaps up and claims to be “very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly!” She admits that she is impulsive, but she denies being calculating. She says that he should go wait for the train, and he leaves. Then she calls him back, and they talk as she leans out the window to him on the street, calling him “kind and tender.” She muses about how society forces roles onto people and then, stroking Jude’s forehead once, sends him away.

	 

	Jude strolls through a graveyard while waiting for the next train. He sees Sue inside her house; she looks at a photograph, presses it to her heart, and cries as she closes the shutters.

	 

Analysis

	Sue characterizes Jude in this chapter as being like “Joseph the dreamer of dreams,” as “a tragic Don Quixote,” and as St. Stephen seeing heaven—“you’ll suffer yet,” she warns. Given Jude’s thoughts as the chapter ends—he knows that he should stay away from Sue, and he knows that he will not—her prediction seems accurate. However, her allusions are uneven: Joseph becomes successful and happy, and St. Stephen receives a heavenly reward. Don Quixote alone earns nothing but suffering by chasing his passion.

	 

	 

IV–2

	The next morning, Jude receives a note from Sue telling him not to visit, not even to think about her. He writes back, agreeing and saying that he must learn “a lesson in renunciation.” A few days later, he receives word that his aunt is on her death-bed. “He threw down his tools and went,” but she dies before he arrives. Now he must communicate with Sue, who comes to the funeral so that he won’t grieve alone. After the ceremony, they return to the house for tea, and Sue recalls Drusilla’s opposition to their marriages. She asks Jude whether it’s right for one person to tell a third party about unhappiness in a marriage. If marriage is “a religious thing,” it must be wrong; but if marriage is “a sordid contract, based on material convenience,” then perhaps it’s not wrong. Sue then wonders whether it’s possible to dislike a person for no reason. What if, she asks, a woman dislikes living with her husband “merely because she had a personal feeling against it . . . a fastidiousness,” when she should be grateful? 

	 

	Jude speaks of how “horrible” things are, how he should have kept her from marrying. He tries to hold her hand, but she withdraws; when he objects, saying that they are cousins, she allows it. Jude breaks the news that Arabella is back, and Sue is hurt that he could think of going back to her so soon. Jude points out that she is no better, having agreed to marry Phillotson. She breaks down, sobbing and admitting that she hates having to be physically responsive to her husband and feels guilty because he is nothing but kind. Marriage, she says, is “a dreadful contract” that compels feelings that ought to be voluntary only. She pushes Jude, who tries to console her, away and flees the house.

	 

	It is too late for Sue to reach the train, so she stays overnight with the Widow Edlin. That night, Jude can’t sleep. He hears a rabbit cry out in a trap and then fall silent, “bearing its torture” rather than calling attention to itself. He imagines the rabbit’s suffering till he must go and dispatch it. As he turns back to the house, Sue leans out the window and says she is glad that he ended the rabbit’s pain. They hold hands through the casement, and she apologizes for offending his “religious sentiments” by confiding in him. He admits that “my doctrines and I begin to part company”—he’d rather love Sue that keep to his faith. Sue says that she “never thought out fully what marriage meant” and wishes she could undo what she has “so ignorantly” done. She believes that future generations will look back “at the barbarous customs and superstitions” of their time with amazement. She weeps, kisses Jude on the head, and shuts the casement.

	 

Analysis

	The critique of marriage that forms a major theme in the novel continues in this chapter. Sue hates her marriage; she’s heard that “what a woman shrinks from—in the early days of her marriage—she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half-a-dozen years.” To Sue, this is like saying “that the amputation of a limb is no affliction, since a person gets comfortably accustomed to the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time!” Her grief is so deep that readers may wonder if, like the rabbit in the trap, she would rather die than remain caught in her marriage.

	 

IV–3

	When Jude returns to Marygreen the next morning, after walking Sue to the train, he wears “a look of exaltation not unmixed with recklessness.” He and Sue kissed passionately before she left. This kiss is a “turning-point” in Jude’s career. He can no longer consider working for the church, “in which sexual love was regarded at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation.” It occurs to Jude that women have “checked” both his career aspirations; he wonders whether they or the system is to blame. Jude digs a hole in the garden by his aunt’s house, places all his theological books it in, and burns them to ash.

	 

	Meanwhile, Sue is angry that Jude made her “give way” to her impulse to kiss him, her logic being that “things which were right in theory were wrong in practice.” She decides to punish him by not writing. Phillotson meets her at the Shaston station, thinking that her sorrow arises from the funeral. She confesses that she and Jude held hands, as cousins, but doesn’t mention the kiss. She goes to bed early, and he comes up after finishing work. He leans on the window and talks to her, but when she doesn’t reply, he sees that she’s not in bed. He finds her reading by the fire. When he wakes later, she still has not come to bed. He finds her sleeping in the stairwell closet on a pallet; she wants to be left alone. Angrily, he tells her that he has “been kind to you, and given you every liberty; and it is monstrous you should feel this way!” She admits this and blames herself, “the universe,” and “things in general, because they are so horrid and cruel!” Because Phillotson worries that the neighbors might hear a fight, he leaves her.

	 

	The next morning, he checks the closet, but Sue has gone. Realizing that Sue prefers spending the night with spiders than with him, he is silent at breakfast till she asks if he would mind if she “lived away from him.” He wonders why she married him at all, to which she replies, “Because I thought I could do nothing else . . . . I was a coward—as so many women are.” She now argues that “domestic laws should be made according to temperament,” and since it is not in her temperament to live as a wife to Phillotson, she asks him to “be my friend and have pity!” When he presses her, she admits that she wants to live with Jude.

	 

	At school, Phillotson cannot concentrate on teaching. He and Sue send a series of notes back and forth. He calls her idea a “preposterous notion,” but she quotes authorities who advise placing authenticity before respectability. He offers to let her live apart in their house; she counters that she could live abroad. Poor Phillotson is dazed. He agrees to separate bedrooms, but the atmosphere is tense: “the fibres of her nature seemed strained like harp-strings.”

	 

Analysis

	The language used to describe Sue throughout the novel suggests an angelic or ghostly nature. She is so slight that Jude sometimes believes he can see through her; she is so dainty that he can hardly feel the touch of her hand. Here, though her behavior is outrageous, by the standards of the time, the imagery associated with her still suggests her other-worldly nature by comparing it to the taut strings of a harp, an instrument associated with heavenly music.

	 

IV–4 

	One evening, Phillotson stays up late, so absorbed in writing about Roman-British antiquities that “he forgot time and place.” Early in the morning, he goes without thinking to his old bedroom, which is now Sue’s only. When he enters, Sue leaps from the bed and jumps out the window. Phillotson runs downstairs and outside to find her collapsed on the ground. He carries her in. She insists that she’s fine, but that she had a terrible dream—then realizes what she is saying and goes silent. Her husband wraps a cloak around her “mechanically” and advises her to lock her bedroom door. She’s tried to, she says, but it won’t lock. She goes to bed, and after a time, he sighs and goes to his own. 

	 

	The next evening, Phillotson walks to Leddenton to visit an old friend, Gillingham. Clearly troubled, Phillotson wants to explain what he is about to do so that one person will know his motivations. He blames himself for marrying without considering Sue’s youth and admits that he understands her attraction to Jude: “They seem to be one person split in two!” He knows Sue has wrestled with her feelings and tried to do what is right. Now he has decided that it is “wrong to so torture a fellow-creature” and that he must let her go: “I am simply going to act by instinct, and let principles take care of themselves.” He wouldn’t refuse to help a person who has “blindly walked into a quagmire,” and he can’t refuse to help Sue.

	 

	Gillingham is dumbfounded: “Good God, what will Shaston say?” He reminds Phillotson that to let Sue go is to destroy his reputation and possibly his career. Phillotson says that the world’s reaction is not his business—he must end the “daily, continuous torture” that he and Sue suffer. Phillotson confesses that he had felt jealous of Jude, but he now understands that Jude and Sue’s “supreme desire . . . is to share each other’s emotions, and fancies, and dreams.” Gillingham objects that if everyone thought and acted this way, the family “would not longer be the social unit.” Perhaps, Phillotson argues, it’s time to redefine that unit.

	 

	Gillingham advises his friend to reconsider, to put up with Sue’s whims but not let her leave. To himself, he thinks that Sue needs to be “smacked” till she accepts her role. But Phillotson, having heard no good reason not to proceed, tells Sue the next morning that he “absolutely and unconditionally” agrees to her release. He is at peace—he has done what is right. They eat their last dinner together, he worrying that she is not eating enough to stay well. He offers her money for traveling, which she refuses to take. She offers to let him inspect what she’s taking, which he refuses to do. She tells him of her regard for him as a teacher and friend, and he pretends to kiss her goodbye, for appearance’s sake. After Sue leaves, Phillotson, a look of pain on his face, walks for a while and comes home to find Gillingham there. Phillotson says, “I would have died for her, but I wouldn’t be cruel to her in the name of the law.” Gillingham helps him pack away the things Sue wouldn’t take, and Phillotson closes and locks the trunk and, symbolically, this part of his life.

	 

Analysis

	Phillotson’s character finally gets to shine in this chapter. He realistically acknowledges facts and admits that he can’t out-argue Sue: “she has read ten times as much as I. Her intellect sparkles like diamonds, while mine smoulders like brown paper.” He is compassionate and forgiving, forward-thinking and generous. It’s possible that Hardy is lecturing readers gently through Phillotson’s words. Yet readers may wonder if Phillotson is too gracious, given what his choices will do to his career. Whether Phillotson is a hero in the book is a question each reader must answer.

	 

IV–5

	When Sue arrives at the Melchester station, Jude is there to meet her, in his best clothes, “his ardent affection burning in his eyes.” He boards the train because they can’t live together in peace in Melchester, where both are known. He’s given up his steady cathedral work. “O I seem so bad—” she exclaims, “upsetting men’s courses like this!” She praises her husband’s decisions and gives Jude a letter from him. Jude says that Arabella has written to him asking for a divorce and that he will give it to her. Then he’ll be free. As they approach Aldbrickham, he says that he’s taken a hotel room for the night. Sue is taken aback—only one room? That is not what she meant when she left Phillotson. Jude is “stultified” but says that Sue’s will “is law to me.”

	 

	Sue hastens to explain that she feels “a woman’s natural timidity when the crisis comes. I may feel . . . that I have a perfect right to live with you,” but in fact she does not yet have “the courage of my opinions.” Jude reads Phillotson’s letter, which asks him to be “tender and kind” to Sue; he wonders if Sue loves him or any man. “My liking for you,” she tells him, “is not as some women’s perhaps. . . . it is a delight in being with you . . . I don’t want to . . . risk it by—an attempt to intensify it.” She begs him not to discuss the matter further. But Jude thinks about the Christminster student and wonders whether Sue is “making a cat’s-paw” of him as well. 

	 

	Sue lets him hold her hand, but then she objects to staying at the hotel he reserved. Jude points out that her squeamishness about public opinion makes her seem “as enslaved to the social code as any woman I know.” Sue admits that, like other women, she sometimes loves to be loved and then regrets the outcome. What she means, Jude says, is that she “flirted outrageously” with Phillotson for the fun of it and “then repented” of the outcome. Sue retorts that Jude concealed his marriage from her. She cries, and Jude comforts her. She is “such a child” that this satisfies her, and they arrive at Aldbrickham.

	 

	Jude finds another hotel and rents two rooms. He doesn’t realize that this is the hotel Arabella brought him to earlier. At dinner, he steps away from the table, and the woman waiting on the table says that she recalls Jude having been here with his wife. Sue feels ill and claims that the woman is mistaken. The woman insists that Jude was here, a month or two ago.  Back in her room, Sue is furious. How dare Jude bring her to the same hotel he’d visited with his wife? She wants to know what happened that night, but he says, “I can’t explain.” Sue feels deeply betrayed: “You’ve been false to me; you, my last hope! And I shall never forget it!” Jude points out that she herself has kept them friends, not lovers and accuses her of unreasonableness: “You concede me no thing and I have to concede everything to you.” Sue falls down on the bed and weeps, and Jude understands that she wants someone to love her and her alone. He says that women never understand that sex may mean nothing to a man, to which she replies that men never understand why women get upset “over nothing.” 

	 

	Jude explains Arabella’s second marriage and assures Sue that he didn’t know about it on the night they spent together. Sue calms down at this, and Jude declares his love for her, “you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet, tantalizing phantom.” She allows him to kiss her on the cheek; then he leaves with a sigh.

	 

Analysis

	Sue’s “curious double nature” is on full display in this chapter. Freed to live with the man she loves, she now pushes him away just as she pushed her husband away. She is “sophisticated in many things” but “a child” in others. Readers may wonder whether Jude will ever have her as the wife that he has long desired, or whether there is something in her nature that objects to the physical aspects of marriage. It’s easy for modern readers to blame Sue for wrecking Phillotson’s life and troubling Jude’s, but readers must remember that she lives at a time when sex is considered, as Jude says earlier, “at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation.” Sue’s ideas may be progressive and liberated, but she still has trouble living them out in the real world. She rejects the old model of marriage but has no new model to follow.

	 

IV–6

	Back in Shaston, the people who had respected Phillotson are now suspicious. Sue has been gone for a month—too long for a visit. And Phillotson is not himself at work. When they press him, he confesses what he has done: “I was not her goaler. I can’t explain any further.” His house-maid confirms the details. Right away, the school committee dismisses Phillotson, but he refuses to resign because to do so would be to admit that he erred. They will have to expel him. A public meeting is called, where Phillotson defends his decisions, but the town is against him. Only some of the town’s itinerant caravan population stands by him—more to his harm than to his aid. Then a few others who have suffered in marriage support him, and soon the meeting comes to blows. The schoolroom is damaged during the fight, a councilor’s shirt is bloodied, a few people have black eyes. Phillotson goes home feeling ill and regretting that he did not resign.

	 

	For some time he remains in bed, seriously ill. Gillingham looks in on him during the evenings and, at one point, mentions that Sue would come if she knew her husband were ill. Better that she not know, Phillotson says; yet Gillingham writes anonymously to her. Three days later, she comes, “like the flitting of a moth,” as a friend. Phillotson almost wishes she had not come. Sue knows nothing of the troubles her departure has brought him. In a nice gesture, she moves the mirror so that Phillotson can view the sunset from his bed. She confesses that Jude does not know she has come, and then she leaves. Against his best intents, Phillotson calls her back and asks whether she would like to make up. “I’ll forgive you and condone everything!” he promises. But Sue says that she’s Jude’s wife “in effect” and explains that he is divorcing Arabella. In fact, Sue is still living with Jude as a friend, not a wife; but Phillotson, in his ignorance, “lay writhing like a man in hell” as he pictured the “prettily dressed, maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name, returning impatiently to the home of her lover.”

	 

	The next time Gillingham calls, Phillotson tells him about Sue’s visit. He responds, “Well, I’m hanged! A little hussy!” But Phillotson doesn’t hear him; he’s talking about giving Sue a divorce. Why bother “keeping her chained”? The only “manly, and dignified, and merciful course is to complete what I have begun.” Also, now that he has lost his job, he can’t afford to keep a wife. Gillingham reminds him that divorces are not easy to obtain.

	 

Analysis

	The fallout of Sue’s departure may strike modern readers as exaggerated, but again, readers must keep in mind the setting. In England in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, behaviors considered sexually improper were scandalous, and communities large and small treated offenders punitively. With essentially no birth control methods available, sexual license for women always carried the risk of a shameful pregnancy. Sue says that “in a proper state of society, the father of a woman’s child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of her under-linen, on whom nobody will have any right to question her.” But that society is a fantasy for Sue and Jude.

771,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part Fifth: At Aldbrickham and Elsewhere," 

Part Fifth: At Aldbrickham and Elsewhere

	 

V–1

	Part Fifth begins after a lapse of time to “a Sunday in the February of the year following.” Sue and Jude are still living at Aldbrickham, chastely, where they run a business cutting tombstones. Both divorces have moved slowly through the courts, a process Jude and Sue perceive as a “distant sound” or in “an occasional missive which they hardly understood.” They’ve furnished their home with their aunt’s belongings; “Sue kept house, and managed everything.” At breakfast, they read a letter that makes Sue’s divorce final; now both are free to marry. But now Sue has a new reason to postpone marriage to Jude: “I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has been obtained under false pretenses” because the courts didn’t know her whole story. Jude says that that is the “advantage in being poor obscure people like us”: no one cares about their stories.

	 

	They take a celebratory walk, “arm in arm . . . like any other engaged couple.” After a decent interval, Jude says, they can marry. “‘Yes, I suppose we can,’ said Sue, without enthusiasm. She worries that a “contract” will kill their love, as it did their parents’. She would rather go on “living always as lovers [as people dating chastely] . . . and only meeting by day,” and she claims that this is the arrangement women prefer. Perhaps, she muses, marriage contracts should forbid spouses to love each other. Then relationships would be forbidden and more fun. But Jude says that some force of nature—by which he means sexual desire—would still compel people to marry, “buying a month’s pleasure with a life’s discomfort.” Sue doesn’t understand this, he says, because she lacks “animal passion.” If she won’t marry him soon, Jude hopes that Sue will at least make “an honest, candid declaration that she loved or could love him.” He’s close to anger and warns that elusive women lose the men they love. Sue looks guilty but replies “in a tragic voice” that she doesn’t care for Jude when he’s “sermony,” at least. Marriage should be her decision, she says, and Jude drops the topic. 

	 

	Analysis

	What should be a resolution of conflict in this chapter—now Sue and Jude are free to marry—instead becomes a new source of conflict. Sue’s aversion to marriage seems genuine: “I think I should begin to be afraid of you,” she tells Jude, “the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a Government stamp . . . . Ugh, how horrible and sordid!” By the end of the chapter, Sue seems to believe that she has persuaded Jude that “fewer women like marriage than you suppose,” but though they stop talking about marriage, “it was constantly in their minds.”

	 

V–2

	Later than month, Jude comes home to dinner after having attended a lecture and hears from Sue that he has had a visitor—a woman. The visitor said she would wait, but Sue told her that Jude might not see her. The woman didn’t leave her name, but Sue thinks it was Arabella, “a fleshy, coarse woman.” They don’t know if Arabella is still with her second husband or why she might be here, but Jude doesn’t want to see her. Sue can’t eat. After dinner, Arabella knocks at the door, saying, “I am in trouble and have nobody to help me!” Jude feels an “inconvenient sympathy” for Arabella, who speaks of “a sudden responsibility that’s been sprung upon me from Australia.” She asks Jude to come out and walk with her. Sue tells him not to go—“it is only to entrap you.” But Jude must go or be cruel. “But she’s not your wife!” Sue exclaims. “And you are not either, dear, yet,” he replies. In fact, Arabella is still more his wife than Sue is, since he has been chaste with Sue, though he has “waited with the patience of Job.” 

	 

	Jude goes out, and Sue counts the minutes, knowing that if Jude is gone too long, he will have “lingered.” And what if, she worries, Arabella offers him a drink? Jude comes back quickly; Arabella is gone, so he needs to put on heavier shoes and go find her. She argues against this because Arabella is “too low, too coarse,” but Jude says that he is, too. What’s more, he’s not “a brute” to turn her away in her trouble: “I do love you, Sue, thought I have danced attendance on you so long such poor returns!” To keep him from leaving, Sue says, “I give in!” and agrees to marry him tomorrow. 

	 

	In the morning Sue “absently” agrees to start the marriage process, but “a glow had passed from her.” Now she claims to feel selfish about how she treated “poor Arabella” in her jealousy. She wants to go check on her. Jude agrees to this as long as Sue goes with him to post the banns for the marriage afterward. They kiss—“The little bird is caught at last,” she says. “No, only nested,” he replies. 

	 

	Sue finds Arabella still in bed at the hotel, looking frowzy—Sue gloats over the quick mental comparison she makes but then feels guilty about it. Sue and Arabella have a quick exchange about whom Jude belongs to, but Arabella tells Sue not to worry—she’s not here to take Jude away. In fact, perhaps her appearance has “helped it on” for Jude and Sue, she thinks, having inferred much from the argument she overheard. She’s just received a telegram from her second husband saying that he will marry her again in England—and promising that he won’t “knock me about when he has had a drop” once they’re married by English law. “I say it as a friend, my dear,” Arabella advises—Sue should hurry to marry Jude and to get the law on her side. Sue responds stiffly that Jude is ready to marry her at any moment. Arabella also says that she will write Jude about a “little matter of business” that she wanted to discuss with him.

	 

	Analysis

	Rarely in the novel do Sue and Arabella confront each other in person. In this case, Arabella, with her worldly experience and pragmatic turn of mind, has the advantage. She has cleverly deduced the situation between Sue and Jude and feels in a position to advise the more naÔve Sue. The confrontation also reveals Sue’s essential loving nature. She tries to be gracious under difficult circumstances and flees when Arabella’s frank comments begin to hurt her. Always highly sensitive, Sue is pained merely by Arabella’s earthy nature and all that it implies.

	 

V–3  

	Sue and Jude go out to see about their banns (announcements of their upcoming marriage). She admits that Arabella’s is “not an ungenerous nature” but also says that their conversation made her feel more deeply “how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is.” She wants to wait longer to post the banns. “O, don’t mind me,” Jude responds with sarcasm, readers may think. “Any time will do for me.” As they are “postponing and postponing,” a letter arrives to disrupt the “dreamy paradise” they inhabit. Arabella is now officially Mrs. Cartlett; and she is sending a child to Jude—“a boy born of our marriage” in Australia. Arabella’s parents have been raising the child but are now sending him to England. Arabella says that the child is too young to work at the bar, and besides, she doesn’t want Cartlett to know about him.

	 

	“It hits me hard,” Jude admits, but Sue feels immediate sympathy for this child that no one seems to want. Though they are struggling financially, Sue declares that they will manage somehow. Then she wonders: “When shall we have the courage to marry?” Jude leaves the matter to her and writes Arabella to tell her to send the child.

	 

	The next evening, the child arrives by the evening train. He has “a small, pale child’s face” and “large, frightened eyes.” He is not entertained by the antics of a kitten that a passenger has brought. When others laugh, he is silent, as if to say that “All laughing comes from misapprehension. Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun.” The odd child doesn’t sleep during night travel, can’t smile, and seems to be “Age masquerading as Juvenility.”

	 

	When the child reaches Lambeth, Arabella gives him food and money and puts him back on the train before Cartlett sees him. Because Jude and Sue don’t know he is coming so soon, they are not at the station to meet him, and he must walk in the dark to their house. Sue “can’t bear” to see Arabella’s looks in him but will “get used to it.” Jude is already full of plans for his son to live the life he was denied: “They are making it easier for poor students now, you know.”

	 

	The boy asks if Sue is “my real mother at last”; with a yearning look, he begins to cry. So does Sue, being “a harp which the least wind of emotion from another heart could make vibrate.” Sue and Jude watch the boy sleep, and Sue says, “There’s more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky.” 

	 

Analysis

	This chapter affords Hardy the opportunity to advance another argument about reforming nineteenth-century concepts of the family. Jude says of the child that his parentage doesn’t matter: “All the little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults all the time, and entitled to our general care.” A favoring of one’s own child and a disliking of others’ children is, “like class-feeling, patriotism, . . . and other virtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom.” Had Jude been the care of all adults as a child, this statement implies, he would have had access to the education he so craved and was obviously suited for.

	 

V–4

	The next morning, largely because of the child, Jude and Sue decide to try to marry again. The child sits silently, “his quaint and weird face set.” Sue asks him his name, but he gives his nickname: Little Father Time, because he looks so old. He was not christened in the church, he explains mildly, “Because, if I died in damnation, ’twould save the expense of a Christian funeral.” Jude says they’ll have him christened the day they marry, yet “the advent of the child disturbed him.” 

	 

	They decide to marry at the registrar’s office and head there together; “they could hardly do anything of importance except in each other’s company.” As they fill out the forms, Sue becomes “painfully apprehensive” at the terms: parties, rather than lovers, for example. There’s no sentiment, no poetry in the contract.

	 

	On errands during the next days, Sue often passes the office where the notice of their engagement is posted. She hates the sight. Often Father Time is with her; she thinks people assume he’s her child and consider the marriage “the patching up of an old error.”

	 

	Jude invites his aunt’s friend Mrs. Edlin from Marygreen, and she comes with gifts and wishes them “a jocund wedding.” Yet she brings up the Fawley history of bad marriages and tells of the Fawley ancestor who was hanged: His wife left him, and during their separation, their child died. He broke into her house to steal the coffin. When caught, he refused to say why he’d broken in, so he was hanged for burglary. Father Time speaks up, advising “mother” not to marry “father.” Sue comforts him—it’s just a story. 

	 

	The next day, Sue seems more nervous. “I had hoped you would feel quite joyful,” Jude says—but the “dismal business” must be concluded. So they walk, with Mrs. Edlin as witness, to the office. There, a “sullen and reluctant” soldier and a “sad and timid” bride are marrying. She is pregnant and has a black eye; he just got out of jail. Sue can’t bear this; she looks “troubled and pale.” Since the certificate allows them to be married anywhere, they leave. They pass the parish church, where a wedding is underway. They slip in to watch, but the bride’s trembling behavior frightens Sue. Jude wonders if they are “horribly sensitive,” but Sue says, “Everybody is getting to feel as we do. We are a little beforehand, that’s all.” 

	 

	As they decide to “go home without killing our dream,” the bride and groom come out of the church. Sue remarks that the bride’s bouquet is “sadly like the garland which decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!” But Jude says that men are victims of this system, too. At home, Mrs. Edlin assumes that they’ve married, but as they haven’t, she takes herself back to Marygreen, remarking that “Nobody thought o’ being afeard o’ matrimony” when she was young. 

	 

	As they enter the house, Sue asks Jude to pretend that they have married—because they’re going to be, eventually, after all.

	 

Analysis

	In this chapter, even the language of the marriage contract critiques the legal bond. Sue, who had never seen the language before, grows “painfully apprehensive” at the terms: “‘Names and Surnames of the Parties’—(they were to be parties now, not lovers, she thought). ‘Condition’—(a horrid idea)—‘Rank and Occupation’ . . . . It spoils the sentiment,’” she complains, transforming something almost sacred into “mere sordid business.”

	 

V–5  

	The child lends to Jude and Sue’s happiness, yet they worry about him. In June they take him to the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, hoping to “mak[e] him kindle or laugh like other boys.” Tents are set up everywhere, crowds are thronging to exhibits. A couple arrives from London: “a short, rather bloated man” and a woman “of rather fine figure and rather red face”—Mr. and Mrs. Cartlett. As they stroll, they see Jude and Sue; Cartlett, who doesn’t know Jude, notes that the couple seems “rather fond” of their child. Arabella watches as Jude and Sue point things out to the boy; she sees that “a passing sadness would touch their faces” when the child fails to respond with gladness. Arabella senses that Jude and Sue have still not married and tries to fathom their relationship; she follows them as her husband goes to see other exhibits.

	 

	Arabella encounters her old friend Anny, who remarks that Jude is handsome and says that Arabella should have kept him. Arabella says that she may be right, and Anny laughs: “That’s you, Arabella! Always wanting another man than your own!” The women then run into Physician Vilbert, who sells Arabella pills he claims will restore youth and brags that he taught Jude Latin and Greek. They watch as Jude and Sue study a model of Christminster, and Arabella mocks Jude for continuing to moon over the town “instead of attending to his own business!” 

	 

	At the band stand, Jude and Sue stand near Arabella but don’t see her, so caught up are they in each other’s presence and the music. “Silly fools—like two children!” she scoffs. Vilbert offers to sell her a “love philtre” made, he says, of doves’ hearts, and she buys it—for a friend. Arabella then meets her husband, who is flirting with barmaids. Nearby, Jude and Sue are admiring roses. She is happy—or would be if the child could be happy, too, but he says, “I am very, very sorry, father and mother.” When he sees the roses’ beauty, he thinks only of how soon they will wilt and die.

	 

	Analysis

	The special relationship that Jude and Sue have developed is on full display in this chapter. Each knows what pleases the other; each takes delight in seeing the other delighted. They seem “almost the two parts of a single whole.” Their tender care for the child is also evident; being sensitive themselves, they relate to his wounded emotional condition. Arabella’s dismissal of them as “fools” and “children” is tinged with envy; this is not the relationship she and her husband share, and she can hardly comprehend what they are to each other.

	 

V–6

	School has begun in Aldbrickham, and people are starting to wonder about Sue and Jude. Children at school ask Father Time questions that sadden Sue and Jude when he reports them. So Sue and Jude travel to London for a few days. When they return, they “let it be understood” that they are now married. Sue’s mood is “dull, cowed, and listless,” and the townspeople still speak of her scandalously. Orders for tombstones drop off, and Jude struggles to pay their legal debts. They decide that it would be better to live some place where no one knows them. Jude will travel to job sites, and Sue will keep house with the child.

	 

	Jude hears, in the meantime, of a job at a church about two miles away. A stone display of the Ten Commandments needs restoration. He takes the job, and one day Sue comes to help with the lettering. The vicar and church warden stop by and are surprised to see Sue working. A woman comes in the clean the church and, when she sees Sue and Jude, is scandalized. She declares to other women there, loud enough that Sue must overhear, that they are a “strange pair to be painting the Two Tables!” The church warden then launches loudly into a story he once heard about to men who drank while working on a display of the Ten Commandments; they set their rum on the communion table itself. In the evening, they thought they saw the devil standing on their ladder, completing their work. On Sunday, the congregation was horrified to see that all the “nots” had been left out of the commandments.

	 

	Jude and Sue gather their tools and leave for lunch, and Sue cries. “Never be cast down!” Jude comforts her. “It was only a funny story.” Sue knows that Jude is losing work because of her, but she also sees how ridiculous the situation is. After lunch, the embarrassed contractor pays them for the whole job and asks them not to come back. They don’t want to harm his reputation, so they go without argument.

	 

	In Aldbrickham, Jude is a member of the Citizens’ Mutual Improvement Society, made up of “young men of all creeds and denominations” who share a “common wish to enlarge their minds.” Because of his former studies, Jude has a leadership role in this organization. A few days after they lose the church job, Jude attends a meeting where nothing specific is said, but Jude knows he must give up his leadership position. They sell their aunt’s furniture, since they can’t afford to move it, and sit in one room listening as bidders buy it for much less that its worth and discussing where to go. They overhear the sale of Sue’s pet pigeons to a poulterer. Later, as Sue passes the poulterer’s shop, she lets her pets out of the cage. She tells Jude the “wicked thing” she has done, and Jude pays the poulterer for the birds.

	 

Analysis

	This chapter catalogues the blows that fall on Sue and Jude because their marriage status is unclear. They lose in succession their work, their community, their home, their belongings, and even their pets because people doubt their marriage and don’t know the child’s parentage. Hardy’s sympathy is clearly with Sue and Jude: “Thus the super sensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away.” Yet it is also with the townspeople, who suffer from shame and who are acting in part, it seems, because of social expectations. If they condone Jude and Sue, they may be punished for their tolerance.

	 

V–7

	Jude and Sue begin “a shifting, almost nomadic life which was not without its pleasantness for a time.” Two and a half years pass in this way. The couple does no church work, however, and seems to be undergoing a gradual rejection of all religious belief. One day during the spring fair at Kennetbridge, Anny and Arabella, “a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a widow,” arrive by carriage. Arabella is there to attend the laying of a church ceremony and to hear a famous preacher from London speak on the occasion. She sees Sue and Juey, as Sue calls the child, selling baked goods and goes to speak to them. Sue expresses sympathy on Cartlett’s death, and the child recalls Arabella as “the woman I thought were my mother . . . till I found you wasn’t.” Sue sends Juey off with a tray of goods to sell. Arabella wonders whether the child knows about his parentage, and Sue says that Jude will tell him in good time. Times are hard, she says. Jude has been too ill to work much, and they have two other children and another on the way, though “it seems such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world—so presumptuous.” As they talk, Arabella helps herself to a cake and sees that it has the shape of a window with stonework patterns. “Still harping on Christminster—even in his cakes!” she says. Sue hates to hear Jude criticized, but she agrees that Christminster, “a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition,” is no good for Jude. Arabella says that she almost wishes she had her son back, especially since Sue has children of her own, but she would never take Juey away. She has found religion and learned to resign herself to God’s will. Sue should, too, she says.

	 

Analysis

	Though Sue seems worn and trembles under Arabella’s questioning, this chapter nonetheless reveals an inner strength. She’s been carrying the burden of the family’s financial support for some time, and she has not lost her incisive intellect. After Sue critiques Christminster, Arabella is surprised to hear a cake-seller speak in this way. Why isn’t Sue teaching, she asks. Is it the divorce? Sue says that she and Jude “gave up all ambition,” and that, but for his illness, they have been happy to do so. Arabella ends their conversation with a stiffly self-righteous lecture that must be entirely lost on one of Sue’s nature and beliefs.

	 

V–8 

	Arabella sings hymns at the cornerstone ceremony. Then she and Anny, with whom she now lives in Alfredston, have tea and leave. Arabella reveals that, while she sang, she couldn’t stop thinking about Sue. “After all that’s said about the comforts of religion,” she admits, “I wish I had Jude back again!” As they pass the house where Jude and Arabella once lived, she exclaims, “What right has she to him, I should like to know. I’d take him from her if I could!” She flings the religious tracts she got at Kennetbridge out the window; religion can’t change who she is. Anny calms her, and they offer a ride to an older man walking on the road. It is Phillotson, once teacher to Arabella and Jude. Arabella explains that Jude has divorced her. Jude, she argues, did right by his divorce, but Phillotson did wrong by divorcing Sue. 

	 

	Phillotson denies her charge but doesn’t want to talk about Sue. He’s teaching at Marygreen “on sufferance,” a humiliating fall for him. Arabella says that Sue’s done no better by their divorce than he has and, what’s more, that she was “innocent” of being Jude’s lover when she left her husband. This information distresses Phillotson. Arabella tells him he should have “kept [Sue] chained” till her spirit was broken: “There’s nothing like bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women.”

	 

	Meanwhile, Sue goes home and greets Mrs. Edlin, who has come from Marygreen to help care for the little children. She tells Jude that Arabella is widowed, and he is disturbed that she now lives so close by. He wants to return to Christminster to work stone again. Sue is troubled. “Why should you care so much for Christminster? . . . Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear.” Yet three weeks later, in June, they arrive among the “wasting walls” of the college town.

	 

Analysis

	Unlikable aspects of Arabella’s personality are revealed in this chapter. Already, readers know her as a practical woman who’s always looking for a better deal than the one she has. But now she begins to actively undermine Jude and Sue’s relationship, looking for cracks that she can wedge open. She speaks to Phillotson not as a human being with whom she can find common ground but as a tool that might split Jude from Sue. Her sudden taking up of religion is matched by her casual throwing it away. Arabella keeps only those things that help her get what she wants.

	 
",Jude the Obscure
772,Jude the Obscure: Novel Summary: Part Fifth: Part Sixth: At Christminster Again,"VI–1

	Jude and his family arrive at Christminster, by his intention, on Remembrance Day. Sue worries that witnessing the graduation ceremony will depress Jude, but he brushes her concern off. He wants to watch the procession before they seek lodging, so they carry the little children through “crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly ignorant parents who had known no College in their youth.” Jude sees the young men who are graduating and says that he learns from them a “lesson on presumption.” As the townsfolk wait for the procession, someone asks what a Latin inscription on a wall means. Jude translates it and then discusses the stone work for the interested crowd. A former coworker recognizes Jude and says that they used to call him the “Tutor of St. Slums.” Tinker Taylor and Uncle Joe greet Jude, surprised to see him: “Yer powers wasn’t enough to carry ’ee through?” Sue tries to distract Jude from them while Juey declares “mournfully” that he doesn’t like Christminster. But Jude begins a lecture on how people define success and argues that he deserves his coworkers’ pity, not their ridicule, because “it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten.” Tinker Taylor is impressed by the sermon from “only a working man!”

	 

	At this moment a red-robed Doctor (professor), late for the ceremony, gets out of a cab and begins to viciously kick the horse in its belly. Jude comments, “If that can be done . . . at college gates in the most religious and educational city in the world, what shall we say as to how far we’ve got?” Police officers shut down Jude’s impromptu lecture as rain begins to fall. Sue is pale with worry and fatigue, but Jude insists on staying to see the ceremony. Afterwards, Sue tells Jude that she saw Phillotson in the crowd and felt “a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of conventions I don’t believe in.”

	 

	Finding lodgings is difficult because the family is large now; for the night, Jude must stay away from Sue and the children, who take lodging elsewhere. But the landlady asks Sue about her relationship to Jude, and she confesses that they are not married. The landlord insists that they leave in the morning. She puts the little children to bed; then she and Juey go to seek other lodgings. They have no luck, and Juey remarks, “I ought not to be born, ought I?”

	 

	Analysis

	A biting criticism of the arrogance of the young Christminster graduates is in this chapter. The narrator describes them as “brothers and sons bearing the opinion written large on them, that no properly qualified human beings had lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now.” This description and the behavior of the Doctor who kicks the horse contrast starkly with Jude’s feelings of humility and failure, despite his impressive and self-taught knowledge. He once had “a neat stock of fixed opinions,” but events caused him to question and shed these. His “present rule of life” is merely to do what causes no harm to himself or others.

	 

IV–2

	From the depressing, bare room, Sue can see the dank walls of Sarcophagus College and Rubric College. Jude placed his family here, she thinks, so “haunted by his dream” is he. She is tired and discouraged, and when Juey asks how he can help, she says there is nothing to be done: “All is trouble, adversity, suffering!” The odd child muses that Sue’s troubles are because of her children, and he is not even her child in fact. He wishes he hadn’t been born and says that all unwanted children should be killed before they are old enough to know that no one wants them. Sue, “doubtfully pondering,” does not know how to respond to “this too reflective child” and at last decides to be honest. She tells him that another baby is coming.

	 

	Father Time “burst out weeping” that Sue has been “so wicked and cruel” to have another baby when they are still so poor—“to bring us all into more trouble!” Sue can’t explain to the young child why she is pregnant again but assures him that “it is not quite on purpose—I can’t help it!” Father Time goes to the closet to sleep, but Sue hears him say, “If we children was gone there’d be no trouble at all.” “Don’t think that, dear,” she calls to him.

	 

	The next morning Sue wakes early to get breakfast before waking the children. She finds Jude and explains that they must leave their lodging that day. They eat breakfast and talk about how to handle things. Back at their lodging, Jude is cooking eggs for the children when he hears Sue scream. He rushes to find her collapsed on the bedding in the closet. Father Time has hanged the little children and then himself. Jude cuts the children down and knows they are dead; he carries Sue to the bed and then runs for a doctor. 

	 

	When he returns, Sue and the landlady are “in wild efforts” over “the triplet of little corpses.” They piece together what must have happened: Juey woke, found Sue gone, and despaired. They find a note that in just six words devastates Sue: “Done because we are too menny.” In agony, she blames herself because she should have lied to comfort the child rather than being honest with him. But Jude assures her that “it was in his nature to do it.” The doctor has told him that children now exist who “seem to see all [life’s] terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them.” These children are “the beginning of the universal wish not to live.” Jude breaks down as he seems to see in his son’s face “all the accidents, mistakes, fears, errors” of his life with Sue. He was “their nodal point, their focus.”

	 

	As they wait for the coroner, they hear someone practicing organ in a nearby college, playing a Psalm of God’s love. Sue cries, “O, O my babies! They had done no harm! Why should they have been taken away, and not I!” In the stillness they overhear “two clergymen of different views” arguing over which way a priest should face during communion. “Good God—the eastward position, and all creation groaning!” Jude exclaims.

	 

	In her grief, Sue feels that “something external” says to them “You shan’t!” This force, whatever it is, won’t let them learn, work, or love. The sight of the clothes she had laid out for the baby makes her weep, but she won’t let Jude take them away. “O my comrade,” she laments, “our perfect union—our two-in-oneness—is now stained by blood!” He replies, “Shadowed by death—that’s all.” Yet Sue persists in blaming herself and their relationship because they “went about loving each other too much.” They tried to “make a virtue of joy,” and this is the result.

	 

	After the burial, Jude checks on Sue, who is resting. When he looks in on her again, she’s gone. He finds her at the cemetery, trying to keep the graves from being filled. She begs Jude to dig the coffins up so that she can see her children again: “I will be so good, and not disobey you ever anymore, Jude, if you will let me?” But this is not possible. Sue goes into labor prematurely and delivers a baby who also dies.

	 

Analysis

	Much of Hardy’s writing features, centrally or tangentially, the idea that there is some force that acts against human efforts. He refers to it by various names, among them the Spinner of the Years and the Immutable Will. Now Sue blames this “something external” for their tragedy. Yet at the same time, she blames herself. The question of how much of the joy or tragedy in a life is the result of human will, human decisions and actions, and how much is relegated to what some call chance or fate is a central question of the novel. Readers see in the next chapter that, finally, Sue blames herself for defying God. This, for her, is easier than blaming some nameless force.

	 

IV–3 

	Sue convalesces, wishing she could die, in new lodgings while Jude returns to work. In the evenings they sit quietly. Sue imagines that she and Jude are being pursued by a “persecutor” and that they “must conform” because “the ancient wrath” of God is against them. Then she accuses herself of becoming “as superstitious as a savage.” She says that they must marry right away, or Jude will begin to lose work. But then she admits that she hasn’t been able to marry Jude because she somehow feels that she still belongs to Phillotson. Sue is clearly torn—between beliefs, between past and future.

	 

	Jude is making money, getting stronger and happier in his stone work. Yet he knows that he and Sue are growing apart as she drifts, almost against her will, toward a religious explanation for their tragedy. One Sunday evening she says thoughtfully that they have been “selfish, careless, even impious” and that now they should “mortify the flesh—the terrible flesh—the curse of Adam!” They must “continually sacrifice” themselves to duty to pay for their mistakes. Jude denies this and assures Sue that she is a good woman who has done nothing to deserve what happened. She imagines pricking her skin to let evil bleed out, and he holds her, assuring her that this is just the effect of grief. But she won’t let him hold her long—“it is indulgence.” She no longer believes that their love can be good, and she can never marry him.

	 

	Jude notes, as he holds Sue, that she smells of incense. She’s been at St. Silas Church, she admits. Jude is surprised, since Sue has always dismissed the church. Sue tells him that she can no longer live “as your wife” because she belongs to Richard or to nobody. 

	 

	A few days later, Arabella comes to their lodgings, having received his letter about their son. She’s been to the grave and wants Jude to make a headstone for it. She wonders what might have been had she taken her son away, but she didn’t want to do that to Jude’s wife. Sue says that she is not Jude’s wife and slips out of the room. Arabella wants to know why Sue said this, but Jude replies, “I cannot inform you.” Arabella says that her father has returned from Australia, and she’s staying with him. She leaves.

	 

	Jude seeks out Sue and finds her at St. Silas, lying in the dark on the floor under an ornate cross, sobbing. She resents his intrusion but explains that she had to flee from Arabella: “My babies have been taken from me to show me this! Arabella’s child killing mine was a judgment—the right slaying the wrong!” Jude tries to persuade her that she’s done no wrong and that any religion that makes her feel this way cannot be good. Sue says that Jude must stop loving her because she is “sacramentally joined” to Phillotson. Their own relationship may have been “Nature’s own marriage,” as Jude says, but it is not Heaven’s—and now Heaven matters more to Sue than nature. He can’t understand this changed Sue, with her “extraordinary blindness” to her former way of thinking. 

	 

	Jude walks Sue back to their lodgings, but she asks him to stay elsewhere, takes his hand, and says good night. He wonders if they should have parted when they found they couldn’t marry: “Who were we, to think we could act as pioneers!” She suggests that all would have been well had they lived “in mental communion, and no more,” something women would and could do but “men can’t because they—won’t.” But Jude is not to blame, she says. Men naturally want to possess women. She, on the other hand, agreed to sexual union with Jude only out of envy of Arabella. Jude begs Sue not to abandon him to his two “Arch Enemies” (women and liquor), but she will agree only to pray for him. Jude walks to their bed and symbolically throws one pillow to the ground, saying, “Let the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour!” She weeps, allows him one more kiss, and sends him away.

	 

Analysis

	A sharp critique of moral and immoral behaviors, as defined, rewarded, or punished by organized religion, is at the heart of this long and dramatic chapter. Sue, who had been, in Jude’s words, “a woman-poet, a woman-seer, a woman whose soul shone like a diamond—whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of,” has been brought to a degraded state by religious teachings. He says that he is “damn glad” to have had “nothing to do with Divinity” that punishes her in this way.

	 

	VI–4 

	After Remembrance Day, Phillotson and Gillingham travel home, and Phillotson reports that he saw “Susanna” in the crowd. He says that he now thinks that Jude and Sue were not lovers when she left him and that he shouldn’t have let her go. Later, he reads of the deaths of the children and thinks how terribly sad Sue must be. A few weeks pass, and he runs into Arabella at the Alfredston market. She has been spying on Jude in Christminster and can report that he and Sue are separated and were never legally married. Sue has been “took in a queer religious way” and now says that she is Phillotson’s wife only. Arabella herself hopes to open a bar to support herself and her father. As she leaves the market, she practices making dimples.

	 

	Phillotson begins to think hopefully about the future. He’s suffered greatly and now wonders whether his actions were right after all. If he were to get Sue back and admit publicly that he erred, his situation might improve. Although Gillingham advises him to avoid the situation, Phillotson writes a careful letter to Sue not to declare love but to suggest that their reunion would improve the chance of success for both of them. He suggests that, if she agrees, she should come to him at Marygreen.

	 

	A few days later, Sue comes to Jude’s lodgings and asks him to go with her to the cemetery. She wants him to learn from her, not from others, that Phillotson has forgiven her and taken her back. They will marry again “for form’s sake,” and he should remarry Arabella. Even had she married Jude, she would feel this way. Jude cries and thinks that the “blow of her bereavement seemed to have destroyed her reasoning faculty.” Her decision is “all wrong” because she doesn’t love Phillotson. Her marrying him is “fanatical prostitution.” She says that though she doesn’t love him, she will “try to learn to love him by obeying him.” Since Jude cannot reason with Sue, he agrees to send her belongings to Marygreen. With tears of pity on his part and of grief on hers, they part over their children’s grave. She says, “Good-bye, Jude; my fellow sinner, and kindest friend!” to which he replies, “Good-bye, my mistaken wife.”

	 

Analysis

	Jude believes that grief has broken not only Sue’s heart but also her mind. He too grieves, yet he refuses to turn to what for him is a bereft faith for comfort for recent events. In fact, Sue is not seeking comfort in religion—only an explanation. It is reason, not faith, that drives her actions—any reasonable explanation, even one that condemns her, is better and easier than no explanation at all. So many elements of chance contributed to the deaths of the children, but unrelated chance events do not satisfy Sue’s need for answers. A wrathful God punishing her for disobeying his law is an answer that at least provides a reason for her tragedies. 

	 

	IV–5

	The next day, Jude is too sad to go to work. Sue travels to Phillotson’s house by herself, and he receives her. She sinks into a chair and stammers, “My children—are dead—and it is right that they should be! I am glad—almost. . . . their death is the first stage of my purification.” Phillotson is moved and bends to kiss her cheek, but she “imperceptibly shrank away, her flesh quivering under the touch of his lips.” When Phillotson is hurt by this, Sue blames the cold. She wants to hurry to remarry while she still cleaves to her belief, yet when she sees the license, she grows pale, like “a condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin.” 

	 

	Gillingham comes to visit, and they talk. Sue eats “obediently” and then goes to Mrs. Edlin’s house for the night. Mrs. Edlin helps her unpack and comes across a pretty nightgown. Sue shreds it, “the tears resounding through the house like a screech-owl,” and burns the pieces because she bought it to please Jude—“It is adulterous!” Everything that reminds her of her former life is evil. Mrs. Edlin is appalled both by Sue’s passion and by the waste of a lovely thing. “Lord, you be too strict!” she says, “. . . to condemn to hell your dear little innocent children that’s lost to ’ee! Upon my life I don’t call that religion!” Sue falls to the bed, sobbing, then slips to her knees. Mrs. Edlin begs her not to marry Phillotson again, because she clearly belongs to Jude, legality aside.

	 

	At Phillotson’s house, he and Gillingham smoke and talk, oblivious to the dramatic scene at Mrs. Edlin’s. Gillingham finds Sue charming and now approves of his friend’s plan. Phillotson says that this time he’ll use “a little judicious severity,” but Gillingham advises him to “tighten the rein by degrees only.” They are interrupted by Mrs. Edlin, who has come to voice her doubts about the marriage. Religion aside, she argues, Phillotson is wrong to marry Sue: “you’ve no notion what she’s suffering.” Phillotson is offended by Mrs. Edlin’s “unseemly” meddling, but she says that truth is truth, and she will not go with them to the church. When she leaves, Phillotson begins to doubt his plan, but Gillingham urges him to go ahead. 

	 

	The next morning, Sue looks pale—“chastened, world-weary, remorseful”—and Phillotson wonders if they are right to marry. But the ceremony goes smoothly, “like a re-enactment by the ghosts of their former selves.” Sue tries to take up housekeeping, and Phillotson allows her privacy.

	 

Analysis

	It is one thing to hear a critique of punitive religious teachings from Jude, who has given up his faith; it is another to hear them from the good-hearted and wise Mrs. Edlin, who has aided and befriended Sue and Jude since they were children. Readers may also feel disheartened that Phillotson, who earlier seemed heroically forward-thinking, now behaves more traditionally. However, one question of the novel is whether or how long people can endure to act against social conventions. Sue has clearly been broken by the stress of living this way, and Phillotson feels the pressure as well.

	 

	IV–6

	Arabella, dressed in “shabby black,” stands at Jude’s door, complaining that her father has turned her out. She asks Jude to take her in to save her from prostitution. Jude responds coldly but offers her a little money. She sobs, and he relents, always a fool for women, as she knows. They make a bed for her on the floor, and even though Jude doesn’t want to talk, she tells of receiving a letter from Anny reporting that Phillotson and Sue are married. 

	 

	For a while, Arabella stays out of Jude’s way. Then she asks to eat breakfast with him, and a little later she offers to find out how Sue is for him. This bait lures Jude in; he can’t say no to news of his Sue. In fact, he meets Arabella at the station when she returns from visiting Anny. Arabella tells him of Mrs. Edlin’s objection to the marriage, of Sue’s destruction of the nightgown. She tries to play on his sympathy, but he walks away to a pub.

	 

	Arabella enlists her father’s help in getting Jude back so that she will no longer be dependent on him. Then she finds Jude in the bar, wavering between anger at and pity for Sue. She gets him drunk enough that she must support him when he walks. Then she offers to take him to her father’s shop so that his landlady won’t see him drunk. As they pass a place where, long ago, martyrs were burned for their faith, he begins to discourse on these holy men. Arabella tries to shut him up, saying that the dead men have nothing to do with them today. But Jude objects that he is “giving his body to be burned”; he doesn’t expect Arabella to understand. 

	 

	As she did when they were young, Arabella coaxes Jude into a bedroom in her father’s house. He’s too drunk to notice and thinks they’re back at Marygreen. “Now we shall get on,” Arabella says.

	 

Analysis

	Arabella has been, throughout the novel, a foil to Sue. She’s fleshy, Sue is slight; she’s earthy, Sue is ethereal. But in one sense she and Sue are alike—they both think well on their feet. Sue does this to find reason after reason to put off marriage and sexual union with Jude; Arabella uses her wits to move from one deal to another. From the moment she picked Jude out to marry, she has weighed her choices and done whatever was necessary to provide for herself. In this and the next chapter, she outdoes herself in entrapping Jude. Yet he is easy prey now—he is the walking dead. Without Sue, he no longer cares what becomes of him.

	 

VI–7 

	Arabella is making breakfast when her father comes down and asks her to mind the shop. But she can’t because she must keep working on getting Jude to marry her. Her father wonders why she doesn’t find someone new and more promising, but Arabella evades the question by saying that marrying Jude is the respectable thing to do. She goes to the bedroom and regards Jude as he sleeps, finding him attractive. Jude wakes and asks where he is. Arabella offers to tell his landlord and employer that he is ill; she takes his wallet to pay his rent.

	 

	In fact, Arabella tells Jude’s landlord that he is moving out. She has his belongings packed and sent to her father’s shop. Jude is so ill, exhausted, and drunk that he doesn’t even notice. She also uses his wallet to purchase a marriage license and to hold a little party where Jude will be kept “happy,” that is, drunk. 

	 

	Three days later, the party begins; it lasts into the night, till “certain legal hours arrive,” as Arabella says. Then, in front of the guests, Arabella reminds Jude that he promised to marry her. He begins to say, “There’s only one woman . . . .” But Mr. Donn protests his daughter’s honor. Though Jude cannot recall living with Arabella for three days, he agrees to marry her to preserve her honor. They leave, and guests stay behind, discussing the odd situation. Tinker Taylor doubts that Arabella’s plan—or the marriage—will work, but when Arabella and Jude return, she shows off “the padlock” (her wedding ring). She suggests breakfast, and when Jude says that he prefers whiskey, she says that his preference in nonsense. Strong tea will set him straight.

	 

Analysis:

	Sue accuses Arabella of being “coarse” and “low,” a woman not fit for the intelligent Jude. Arabella may not have academic knowledge, but she knows people, and she uses her understanding of character to manipulate people. She knows that Jude loves Sue, but she also knows that he considers himself an honorable man who carries out his duties. 

	 

VI–8

	About three months have passed since Jude married Arabella. His health has gone from “indifferent” to “precarious”; he’s racked by coughing. Arabella feels deceived because Jude was well and making good money before they married. Now she must work to support them both. Jude, thinking that he will soon die, asks Arabella to write to Sue for him, to ask her to visit. His request insults Arabella, but he argues that he is being “above-board” rather than sneaking a message to Sue. Arabella then claims that there is no need to write because Sue won’t come: “She’s the rat that forsook the sinking ship!” Arabella calls Sue a “strumpet” [whore], but Jude leaps up, pushes Arabella down, and threatens, “Say another word of that sort . . . and I’ll kill you—here and now!” Racked by coughing, he lets her go, and she “estimated his life with an appraiser’s eye.” 

	 

	Arabella agrees to write to Sue as long as both women will be present at the visit. Jude doesn’t know whether Arabella posts the letter (she does not), and he doesn’t ask; but he waits for Sue’s visit with every coming train. He is now living for this visit: “A silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him, which gave him, if not strength, stability and calm.”

	 

	One day, Arabella comes home and finds Jude gone—she can guess where. He has taken the train to Alfredston and is now walking, in the rain, to Marygreen. He stands in front of the church and looks at the school where Sue teaches, listening to the “sing-song tones of the little voices that had learnt Creation’s groan.” He asks a child to ask Mrs. Phillotson to come to the church. When Sue steps into the church and see Jude, she almost leaves, but Jude asks her to be kind. She praises him for marrying Arabella, but he lashes out at her, calling that marriage “degrading, immoral, unnatural” and “meretricious.” And her marriage is no better; he cannot imagine how she has submitted to it. Sue admits that she has “wrestled and struggled, and fasted, and prayed” and now has “nearly brought my body into complete subjection.”

	 

	His pity is greater than his anger for this “dear, sad, soft, most melancholy wreck of a promising human intellect,” his Sue. Sue asks him not to scorn her but to kiss her and admits that she has so far been physically faithful to him and that she still loves him. They kiss passionately; Sue hates herself for wanting to, but can’t help herself. Jude again dismisses their marriages, made while he was “gin-drunk” and she was “creed-drunk,” and urges her to run away with him. Tempted, she flees. He wraps his blanket around himself and coughs; she covers her ears to keep from hearing the sound and running back to him. 

	 

	Jude leaves Marygreen. When he comes to the mile stone on which, so long ago, he carved “Thither J. F. →” he lies down to rest. Then he goes back to Christminster.

	 

Analysis

	If the deaths of Father Time and the children are the novel’s climax, the scene in the church is the most dramatic of the novel’s denouement. It makes clear beyond doubt that Jude and Sue belong together; it strongly suggests that the social impediments to their union are to blame for the sorrows that have happened in their lives. It is a nice irony that this scene takes place in the shelter of the church; it is almost like the wedding that Sue and Jude never had, as they declare their love and kiss.

	 

	 

VI–9

	Arabella is waiting for Jude at the Christminster station and can see right away that the trip has harmed his health irreparably. Does he realize this? “Of course I do,” he says. “I meant to do for myself.” Arabella is taken aback that Jude would kill himself “for a woman.” He explains that, while Arabella is physically stronger than he is, he has a mental strength she lacks. He had two wishes: to see Sue one last time, and to die. In one stroke he has achieved both. “Lord—you do talk lofty!” she comments.

	 

	As they pass the colleges on their way home, Jude relives his first day in Christminster, imagining again that he sees “the spirits of the dead.” Arabella questions his sanity. He says that “the grind of stern reality” has caused him to lose interest in them but that now “They seem to be laughing at me!” He begins to name them, but Arabella points out, pragmatically, that the streets are empty, and besides, “What do I care about folk dead and gone!” 

	 

	Jude must stop to rest; the buildings around him seem to have “lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of the University at the efforts of such as I.” Arabella says she’ll treat him to a drink, and he goes with her willingly but says that when he dies, she’ll see “his spirit flitting up and down here among these.” Arabella tells him to cheer up, because—who knows?—perhaps he’ll pull through.

	 

	Meanwhile, in Marygreen, Mrs. Edlin goes to the Phillotsons’ house to help with chores because Sue, though well intentioned, can’t handle the heavy tasks. Sue is scrubbing the steps as penance for kissing Jude. Mrs. Edlin tells her to spare her pretty hands, but Sue responds, “This pretty body has been the ruin of me already!” She confesses to her old friend what she said and did in the church. Mrs. Edlin is not surprised: “I told ’ee how ’twould be!” But Sue says that she will now make the ultimate act of penance by consenting to sex with her husband. Mrs. Edlin urges her not to do this—things are fine as they are. But Sue sees her “separateness” from her husband as an “indulgence” that she was wrong to demand. Sue can’t explain to Mrs. Edlin why sexual union is such a torture to her—she couldn’t explain it to Jude, either. But now she will do her wifely duty—“I will drink my cup to its dregs!” When Mrs. Edlin starts to leave, Sue is “seized with vague terror,” so Mrs. Edlin agrees to stay in the spare room that night in case Sue needs comforting in the morning. Sue goes to her room to prepare herself in prayer. Then she enters Phillotson’s room.

	 

	Phillotson is silent. Sue thinks he is asleep and feels relief—the terrible act can be postponed another day. Then she wonders—what if he is dead? Then Sue could return to Jude—“Ah—no—I forgot her—and God!” she corrects herself. She asks Mrs. Edlin to check on Phillotson, who is now snoring. So Sue enters again, and he wakes. She asks him to forgive that she “exceeded my rights” and “sinned against you,” but he wants to know that she is not acting “against your impulses.” She explains to him what happened in the church and then promises never to see Jude again. That life—and her babies—are dead. Phillotson, having heard such promises before, makes her swear on a New Testament and asks her three times if she is sure about consenting to sex. He picks her up and kisses her—“A quick look of aversion passed over her face, but clenching her teeth she uttered no cry.” 

	When Mrs. Edlin sees that Sue has gone in with Phillotson, she says, “Ah! Poor soul! Weddings be funerals ’a b’lieve nowadays!”

	 

	Analysis

	If in the scene in the church in the previous chapter Jude and Sue so clearly are meant to be together, the scene as Arabella and Jude walk home through Christminster shows as clearly how unable Arabella is to understand Jude. His meditations on the town frustrate, annoy, and bore her and make her doubt Jude’s mind: “Upon my soul you are more sober when you’ve been drinking than when you have not!” she exclaims. Arabella has always considered Jude’s physical nature attractive—his sexuality, his ability to work and earn money—but she has never come to love what Sue loves in him, his intellect. Sue, by contrast, has terrible difficulty loving Jude—or any many—physically.

	 

VI–10 

	Jude recovers enough to work again, but in December he relapses. Arabella complains that Jude married her “to get a nurse for nothing,” but Jude seems either amused by or indifferent to her anger. He sometimes talks of “the defeat of his early aims” and theorizes that he wasn’t physically strong enough for stone work. He was made, he thinks, for getting and imparting information. He talks of rumors that the University will soon be open to more young men, but “it is too late . . . for me . . . and for how many worthier ones before me!” Arabella thinks that if Jude had any sense, he’d have “got over all that craze for books by this time.”

	 

	One day Jude calls Arabella “Sue” by accident. Arabella starts to insult Sue but stops short. Over time, she perceives that Sue is no longer a rival and, in “a fit of generosity,” says that Sue can visit. But Jude surprises her by saying that he doesn’t want to see her again, nor does he want her to hear about his illness. 

	 

	Mrs. Edlin pays Jude a surprise visit; after Arabella, who is no longer concerned with whom Jude loves, leaves, he asks the widow about Sue. Is she still living chastely with her husband? As briefly as she can, Mrs. Edlin explains that Sue, as penance for kissing Jude, has consented to sex. Jude finds this information “almost more than I can endure!” He speaks at length of what a terrible fall this is for Sue, “so sensitive, so shrinking, that the very wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference.” He apologizes to Mrs. Edlin for rambling, but she responds, “Not at all, my dear boy. I could hearken to ’ee all day.” 

	 

	Jude’s “mental agony” provokes him to use “terribly profane language about social conventions” and brings on a coughing fit. Mrs. Edlin answers the door to find that Arabella has sent Physician Vilbert to treat Jude. Jude has already taken Vilbert’s quack medicines to no avail and tells Vilbert what he thinks of him “with such striking epithets, that Vilbert soon scurried” away. Arabella meets him at the door, offers him a drink, and flirts with and kisses him on the first floor while Jude suffers on the second floor. After Vilbert leaves, Arabella justifies her actions: “Well, weak women must provide for a rainy day.” Since Jude seems likely to die, “it’s well to keep chances open.” 

	 

Analysis

	Though she is a minor character, Mrs. Edlin, widow and friend for decades to the Fawleys, is notable. Her advice is consistently sound and compassionate; but what’s more, when Jude or Sue fails to take her advice and then suffers for that choice, she never judges them. She only graciously offers help, doing chores for Sue, minding their children, or simply listening to Jude in his offensive ramblings. She is, Sue says at one point, their only friend.

	 

	VI–11 

	Summer has come. Jude, his face thin, is bed-ridden. Arabella is in front of the mirror, curling her hair and practicing her dimple. Hat and gloves on, she sits impatiently by Jude, waiting for her father to come so that she can leave for Commemoration Day festivities. She hears bells ringing and crowds assembling; she does not want to wait with Jude for death when the town is so lively. At last, she decides that Jude will be all right for a while and leaves. 

	 

	The noise of the crowd wakes Jude, and he asks for water, but no one replies, and he is too weak to get up. He gasps, “Throat—water—Sue—darling—drop of water—please—O please!” His face is changing, and he begins to quote from the book of Job: “Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? . . . then had I been at rest!” He dies alone.

	 

	Meanwhile, Arabella sees people dancing in the streets and wants to join them, but she must go home and check on Jude. Some of the stone workers see invite her to go watch boat races, so she runs up to check on Jude before leaving. She thinks he is sleeping, but then she realizes that he has died. She listens to his chest to be sure: “The bumping of nearly thirty years had ceased.” She hears the sound of the band playing by the river and complains, “Why did he die just now!” His timing is spoiling her fun. She thinks for a moment, then leaves and closes the door. The workers ask how Jude is, and she says that he is “sleeping quite sound. He won’t wake yet.” At the river, Arabella mingles with the crowd, enjoys the spectacle, and is glad she came, though she wishes she could stop thinking of Jude now and then. After the races, she “must get back to my poor man.” Arabella stops at the house of a woman who prepares the dead for burial and then by the house of the sexton. By night, Jude’s body is ready for burial. 

	 

	Two days later, Arabella and Mrs. Edlin stand by Jude’s coffin. Mrs. Edlin has been crying but notes that Jude makes “a ’andsome corpse.” They hear the festivities of the “young and strong-lunged” in the town. Jude’s few remaining books “seemed to pale to a sickly cast at the sounds,” but Jude’s face seems to wear a smile and “The bells struck out joyously.”

	 

	Arabella wonders whether Sue will come, but Mrs. Edlin doubts it, since Sue swore an oath not to see him again. She reports that Sue is “Tired and miserable . . . years and years older than when you saw her last . . . a staid, worn woman now,” but a woman at peace, at least. Arabella denies this: “She’s never found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till she’s as he is now!”

	 

Analysis

	Readers may wonder that Hardy lets one of the novel’s least sympathetic characters have the last word, as Arabella does. Readers can consider whether Arabella is right—will Sue find peace only at death? If so, the novel’s pessimistic ending dooms Sue to a life of penance because she tried to defy social convention. But Arabella is not always right in the novel, leaving the possibility that Sue will work out some kind of redemption for herself, possibly in her teaching or in her love for children that may be born.

787,Sister Carrie: Novel Summary,"

Summary
	Chapter One begins in August 1889 with Caroline Meeber (Sister Carrie) boarding the afternoon train for Chicago. She has her ticket, her sister’s address, four dollars and a small trunk. She is leaving home, which was in Columbia City, and is aged 18. The readers are told she is called Sister Carrie by her family and self interest is her ‘guiding characteristic’. She is described as a ‘fair example of the middle American class’, is two generations removed from the emigrant and books are ‘beyond her interest’.
	A well-dressed young man engages her in conversation on the train and she is impressed by the way he looks and by his tales of travelling. She tells him her sister’s address and he gives her his business card. He, Chas A. Drouet, is a travelling salesman and he feels he has gained a victory when she gives him the address and she thinks she has yielded something. He arranges to meet her at this house on Monday. This chapter ends with Carrie being met at the train  station by her sister, Minnie, who looks weighed down from hard work.
	In Chapter Two, the narrative shifts to Minnie’s flat. She is married to Sven Hanson and they have a baby. Hanson is quiet and is indifferent to Carrie’s presence as long as she pays her board. He is employed in the stock yards and is also paying for two lots of land which he hopes to build on one day. Carrie sees they are only interested in ‘a conservative round of toil’ and it will not be possible for Drouet to visit her there. She sees she will have to establish herself first before inviting visitors home and writes to him to call off the meeting.
	The narrative shifts to describe how Chicago is an ambitious and quickly expanding city at this time and timid Carrie wends her way through the commercial centre looking for work. She is overawed by ‘these mighty concerns’.
	Her search for work continues in Chapter Three as she summons up the courage to ask for employment. She is directed to a department store (The Fair) and is envious of the wealth on display. Because of her lack of experience, she is turned away. She then enquires after a stitching job, but this only pays three and a half dollars a week. At a shoe factory, she is offered work for a dollar a week more and she accepts this. The chapter ends with Carrie happy at the thought of living and working in Chicago.
	In Chapter Four, she is described as looking forward to spending her wages and is clearly unrealistic about her financial situation. After the evening with Hanson and Minnie, she says she would like to go to the theater, but is told Hanson will not be able to as he has to get up early for work. Minnie sees that although Carrie is timid, she will not be put off from seeking pleasure. Carrie goes for a walk instead and begins to wish Drouet would come to see her on Monday after all as the flat is so humdrum.
	On Monday, she walks to the factory to save money and is taught to punch holes in shoes for the shoe laces to thread through. She learns how to do this and is extremely tired by the end of the day, and is also disconcerted by her fellow workers (in particular, the lewd comments from some of the men).
	On Monday evening, in Chapter Five, the narrative focuses on Drouet. He does not come to see Carrie as he has received her note asking him not to. Instead, he dines at Rector’s and then visits the saloon, Fitzgerald and Moy’s. Drouet enjoys frequenting such places as they feed his vanity; they are well-thought of establishments. There is also mutual admiration between Drouet and Hurstwood (the manager of Fitzgerald and Moy’s). Drouet is impressed by Hurstwood’s success and Hurstwood likes the way Drouet dresses and his genial nature. The chapter ends with Hurstwood asking Drouet to come back later as he has something to show him. Drouet then boasts how he met a ‘little peach’ on the train into Chicago.
Analysis
	These first few chapters establish our main characters (Carrie, Hurstwood and Drouet) and the readers are exposed to their preference for appearance and social standing. Although Carrie attempts to find employment and begins work in the shoe factory, it is reiterated that she does not want the life of toil which her sister leads. Carrie prefers to be a consumer and this is glimpsed in her pleasure and envy in the department store. Drouet and Hurstwood are similarly impressed by signs of wealth as this is central to their mutual admiration.
	Even in these early pages of the novel it is apparent that the narrative avoids condemning these characters for such material desires. They are written of as characteristics of the successful city dweller; the consumer drives the economy of the growing metropolis as may be seen in these new department stores, with which Carrie is enamoured.

788,Pride and Prejudice: Novel Summary: Chapters 1-4,"Chapter 1: Chapter one introduces Mr. and Mrs. Bennet of the Longbourn estate.  Mrs. Bennet has been told that a ""young man of large fortune from the north of England"" is moving to Netherfield, an estate near theirs, and she has designs on marrying him to one of her daughters.  Mrs. Bennet says that Mr. Bennet must go and see Bingley, the new neighbor, ""as soon as he comes,"" and that he should think of his daughters and what a good marriage it would be. Mr. Bennet's preference for his daughter Elizabeth also becomes evident, when he says she ""has something more of quickness than her sisters,"" whom he describes as ""silly and ignorant like other girls."" Mr. Bennet teasingly questions why his visit to Bingley could be so important.
	Chapter 2: Elizabeth, as well as three of her four sisters, Kitty, Mary, and Lydia are briefly introduced in chapter two.  While in Chapter one Mr. Bennet teases his wife saying he will not visit Bingley as soon as he arrives, in Chapter two we learn that indeed ""Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley.""

He says of Elizabeth, ""She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me."" Jane, the eldest of the Bennet's daughters dances with Bingley twice, and that joy is enough to make Mrs. Bennet ""quite delighted"" with him. 
	Chapter 4: When Jane and Elizabeth are alone, Jane admits how much she admires Bingley, and that she finds his sisters, Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, charming.  Elizabeth however, wonders at how her sister never finds fault with anybody, and how she can be ""so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others."" Elizabeth does not find Bingley's sisters charming, but rather proud and conceited. It is told that Bingley inherited money from his father, and that his sisters are anxious for him to have an estate of his own.  Miss Bingley is going to live at Netherfield with Bingley, and despite the differences between Bingley and Darcy, theirs is a ""very steady friendship,"" and Bingley thinks very highly of Darcy's judgement and regard.

	Chapter 34: Elizabeth is surprised by a visit from Darcy while the others are at Lady Catherine's.  Darcy shocks Elizabeth by telling her that he admires and loves her and wishes her to marry him.  He speaks of how he has tried to fight his love for her because of her and her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth can see that he has no doubt that she will accept his hand.  He is quite amazed when instead she does not accept, and says that she is not only offended by the speech he has just made, but that she has other reasons for declining his offer, such as how he had treated Jane and Wickham.  Darcy admits to separating Bingley and Jane and rejoicing in his success at it, and he speaks with contempt of Wickham.  Darcy angrily accuses Elizabeth of not being able to overlook these offenses because her pride was hurt by his speech about her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth states that the only thing those declarations did was spare her any concern she may have in refusing him.  He is astonished when she says that he ""could not have made [her] the offer of [his] hand in any possible way that would have tempted [her] to accept.""

	In reference to his talking Bingley into leaving Netherfield, he states that he had seen Bingley in love many times before, and that he did not realize how serious this relationship was until the ball when he heard Sir William and others speaking of how they expected a marriage.  He then observed Bingley and Jane closer, and while he saw that Bingley was clearly affected by Jane, he thought Jane seemed more indifferent to Bingley.  When he explained his concerns about the inferiority of Jane's family to him, Bingley was not willing to give her up, but when Darcy told him that he felt Jane indifferent, Bingley agreed to leave.
	With respect to Wickham, Darcy also explains.  He writes that his father indeed had the highest opinion of him, but that after his death Wickham received an agreed upon sum, and when it was gone, came back for more to support his ""life of idleness and dissipation."" Darcy would not give him more money, and did not hear from him a while, until he found out from his sister that she felt herself in love with him.  Darcy arrived in time to stop the elopement.  Darcy concludes his letter by hoping that she will acquit him of any cruelty towards Wickham, and that if she needs any proof of the truth of what he had written, she could talk to Colonel Fitzwilliam.
	Chapter 36: Elizabeth reads through Darcy's letter with a mixture of emotions.  When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family.  However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly.  She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger.  As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been ""blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,"" and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened.  She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.  After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes.

Even though Elizabeth had rather not hear about it, Lydia tells her about the events of her wedding day, including that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding.  Elizabeth is shocked at the mention of him, but Lydia will say no more, as she has remembered that she had promised him and Wickham not to say anything about his presence.  Elizabeth can of course think of nothing other than what he could be doing there, and sends off a letter to Mrs. Gardiner asking her about it.
	Chapter 52: Elizabeth receives a prompt reply from her aunt, from which she learns that Mr. Darcy had gone to London, found Lydia and Wickham, and reported to her uncle as soon as her father had left the city.  Her aunt also tells her that it is Darcy who has paid for Wickham to marry Lydia, but that he had wanted Mr. Gardiner to take the credit and for his part in the matter to be kept secret.  As explanation of his actions, Darcy states that he feels guilty for not exposing Wickham for what he was before a situation such as this occurred.  Elizabeth suspects that while this may have been his true motive, his affection for her may have also been part of it.

	Chapter 54: Darcy and Bingley come to dinner on Tuesday, and Jane is determined that she and Bingley be seen as ""indifferent acquaintances,"" as she does not want to gain any hopes from his coming.  Mrs. Bennet however, had renewed all of her hopes for marrying Jane to him.  Elizabeth notes that Bingley sits by Jane at dinner and shows much admiration of her, and while she is anxious to converse with Darcy, she does not get a chance that night, and he seems to show little interest in her.  After the guests have left, Jane tells Elizabeth that she has no hopes for her and Bingley, and Elizabeth tells her that if she persists in indifference, not to make her her confidante.
	Chapter 55: A few days later Bingley calls again, this time alone, as Darcy has had to return to London for a few days.  When he comes to dinner Mrs. Bennet does all she can to try to get Bingley and Jane alone together, and both Jane and Elizabeth are embarrassed by her obvious attempts.  On his second visit, Mrs. Bennet succeeds, and when Elizabeth returns to the drawing room after the couple's time alone, she finds that they have become engaged.  Jane goes to tell her mother, and Bingley goes to talk to Mr. Bennet.  Mr. Bennet is happy with the match, and Bingley becomes a daily visitor to Longbourn.  Word of the engagement is spread, and soon all of the neighbors are jealous, whereas before they had thought the Bennets unlucky because of the business with Lydia.
	Chapter 56: About a week after Jane and Bingley's engagement, Lady Catherine makes a surprise visit to Longbourn.  She asks Elizabeth to take a walk with her, and proceeds to tell her that she is alarmed by the rumors that she is to marry her nephew Darcy.  She insists on having the rumor contradicted, as she does not approve of the match because of the inferiority of Elizabeth's family.  Elizabeth talks around Lady Catherine's questions, and Lady Catherine finds her impertinent, and insists that she speak to her frankly.  Lady Catherine says that Darcy and her daughter are destined for each other, and demands to know if Elizabeth means to marry Darcy.  Elizabeth asks how she could be engaged to Darcy if he is engaged to Miss De Bourgh.  Lady Catherine gets increasingly irritated, and Elizabeth finally tells her that she is not engaged to Darcy.  Lady Catherine seems relieved by this, but when she asks Elizabeth to promise that she will never enter into such an engagement, Elizabeth refuses.  Lady Catherine leaves angrily, saying that she will continue to make sure that she and Darcy are not married.

	Chapter 58: Soon Darcy returns from London, and he and Bingley visit.  Jane, Elizabeth, Bingley, Darcy and Kitty go for a walk, but Elizabeth and Darcy are left alone when Jane and Bingley walk off and Kitty leaves to call on Maria.  Elizabeth tells Darcy that she knows of the help that Darcy gave to Lydia, and says that she is quite grateful.  Darcy is sorry that she had found out about it, but says that her family owes him nothing, as he only thought of her when he did it.  He tells her that his feelings for her are the same as they were when he proposed, but that he will speak of it no more if hers have not changed.  She asserts that her sentiments have undergone quite a change, and that she is happy that he feels the same.  Darcy tells her that his aunt's retelling of her conversation with Elizabeth had given him hope that her feelings for him had changed. Elizabeth apologizes for anything she said before that could have hurt him, but Darcy says that her reproofs were valuable, as they have helped him to change.  Darcy states that he is happy with the engagement of Jane and Bingley, and admits that he had told Bingley of his mistake about Jane's indifference, and had basically given Bingley permission to pursue the match.
	Chapter 59: Elizabeth and Darcy lose track of time with their walking and talking, but although the family notices their absence, they think nothing of it, as they do not believe anything could happen between the two.  Later in the evening Elizabeth tells Jane of what occurred between she and Darcy, and Jane is incredulous.  It takes a bit of convincing for Jane to finally believe that Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy had changed and for her to be happy for her.  The next day Mrs. Bennet makes more disparaging remarks when she sees Darcy coming, and makes Elizabeth walk out with him again so that the rest of the family does not have to be around him.  During their walk it is decided that Darcy will ask Mr. Bennet for his consent to his daughter's hand that evening. 
	When the evening arrives, and Darcy leaves from his conference with her father smiling, Elizabeth is somewhat relieved, but she is still nervous about disappointing her father with her choice of husband.  Mr. Bennet asks Elizabeth if she is out of her senses, as he thought that she had always hated the man.  As with Jane, it takes a bit of convincing to make her father see that she is indeed in love with Darcy, and he accepts the match.  She also tells her father of what Darcy had done for Lydia, and he is relieved that it was not his brother-in-law after all, as he knows that Darcy will not receive repayment from him.  That night Elizabeth follows her mother upstairs to tell her the news.  She is quite shocked, but then gets quite excited about how much money Elizabeth will have, and how she will have three daughters married.

Chapter1: Huck begins his narration, explaining that this story takes up where the previous one, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, left off: he owns six thousand dollars from the money he found in the cave, and this money he has given to Judge Thatcher, who is keeping the money and paying him interest. He lives with the Widow Douglas (who is trying to civilize him) because Tom won't let him join his ""gang"" otherwise.
	Restlessly lying in bed one night, he hears Tom Sawyer calling to him through the window, and the two escape together into the woods.
	Chapter 2: After playing a trick on Jim, Miss Watson's slave, Tom and Huck meet the rest of the boys in the woods. Tom tells everyone that to be in the gang, they must take an oath and sign their names in blood. If any one of them breaks the secrecy of the gang, however, his family will be killed. Since Huck doesn't really have a family, he tells the others that they may kill Miss Watson if he spills any secrets. As daylight approaches, the gang agrees to meet at a later date to go about the business of ""[robbing] somebody and [killing] some people.""
	Chapter 3: Huck briefly explains how he gave up the religion Miss Watson was trying to force on him and how his father was said to be drowned but that he didn't believe it. Next, he says that the gang has broken up, because they weren't doing any real violence, but just pretending. The comical scene of the Sunday School picnic, where Tom tells Huck that actually the schoolchildren are a procession of rich Arabs and their elephants, uncovers the differences between the two boys. Like Don Quixote, Tom is the idealist, while Huck is the realist who doesn't believe his friend's ""lies.""

Chapter 4: Huck explains that he has been going to school fairly regularly now, and that he doesn't mind it too badly. He also says that he's getting used to living with the Widow Douglas and her sister.
	In this chapter Twain continues to show Jim's belief in superstition and magic, as Huck says that the slave taught him quite a bit about the subject. He even tells Huck's fortune for him, telling him that his life will be filled with both joy and grief. Later, the reader will notice that Jim's magic signs often serve as foreshadowing for the future.
	Chapter 5: Huck's pap surprises him when he climbs into his bedroom window to confront him. The fifty-year-old man yells at his boy for getting an education, demanding that he quit school and give up ""religion"" immediately. It seems the old man is afraid that his son will know more than he does. What his father mainly wants, however, is to get his hands on Huck's six thousand dollars.
	Later, going before the judge, Huck's pap promises to change his ways, saying that he will become civilized and live decently. This cons the judge for awhile, but when the old man gets drunk the very same night, everyone realizes that there's no chance he will ever change.
	Chapter 6: In this chapter, Huck's pap kidnaps the boy, and the two live a few miles away in a shack deep in the woods. For two months the father and son live together there, and Huck admits that he didn't really want to return to the Widow Douglas' house anyway. Huck enjoys the freedom life in the wilderness affords him, noting that he took up cussing again since his father didn't mind.

Chapter 7: Tired of being constantly locked in the cabin by his father for days at a time, Huck decides to dig a hole to the outside, taking care to cover it up with a stump so his pap doesn't see it. One day after his father locks him in as usual, Huck leaves the cabin through his hole, goes hunting, kills a pig and brings it back. He spatters the blood all about and smashes in the door to the shack, making it look as if he's been murdered. He next gets into a canoe and paddles to Jackson's Island, a nearby, uninhabited wilderness area where he plans to hide for awhile. Ironically, Huck is able to live only by feigning his own death.
	Chapter 8: Hearing the noise of a cannon coming from a ferryboat traveling down the river, Huck immediately realizes that they are hoping to bring his body to the surface. The boat comes so close to the island that he can even see those he knows onboard as they scan the water for his corpse.
	Having stayed several days on the island now, Huck admits that he really enjoyed the freedom it gave him. He explains, ""I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say..""
	Soon thereafter, however, Huck encounters an acquaintance on the very same island, hiding, just as he is doing. This is Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Seeing the boy, Jim immediately falls to his knees, believing Huck to be dead and thus thinking that he is seeing his ghost. The two explain their stories to one another, and they agree to help each other escape. Huck admits that being with Jim made him feel less lonely.

They find their raft further downstream as they pass a ferryboat with a watchman on deck. Huck, wanting to help the ""rapscallions"" who he and Jim had stranded, tells this man that he is from the wrecked steamboat (ironically named the Walter Scott) and that his family is still on board.
	Later, Huck thinks to himself that the Widow Douglas would be quite proud of him for helping the men, since these are the kind, according to her, that most need helping.
	Chapter 14: Looking through the supplies they had received from the wreck, Huck and Jim talk about the adventures they've just had. Through the course of the conversation, Huck admits that Jim ""had an uncommon level head, for a nigger."" This shows that some of Huck's assumptions about Jim are beginning to change.
	Next, perhaps the most comical scene in the book takes place as Huck and Jim discuss the nature of kings and dukes. Huck, who has read more about them in his books, explains to Jim that kings don't do any work, but still get to have as much of anything as they want. Jim's knowledge of kings is limited to ""King Sollermun."" The two have a humorous conversation about him, and this leads into a discussion of languages, Jim not understanding the nature of different languages. This all serves to show Huck that Jim, though he may have an ""uncommon level head,"" is incredibly ignorant and stubborn.
	Chapter 15: Still planning on getting into the free states of the North, Jim and Huck continue their journey. Eventually the two get separated from each other, and Jim comes to believe that Huck has died. When Huck finds Jim a bit later, Jim is surprised but happy to see him again.

Chapter 16: Believing themselves to be close to freedom now, Huck begins to feel guilty for having helped Jim escape. Southern society has taught him that freeing a slave is a sin, and Huck starts to worry that he will go to hell.
	Being forced to postpone these thoughts for later, however, Huck is confronted by men who are looking for fugitive slaves. Wanting to search the raft for the slaves, the men begin to row out to it. Huck, however, ingeniously dissuades the men from such action by telling them that his father is onboard and has smallpox. Instead of helping, the men give Huck some money in charity.
	Later, now night, Huck and Jim jump overboard and are separated when a much larger vessel cuts their little raft into two pieces. Huck nearly drowns, but manages to reach shore, not having heard any sign of Jim.
	Chapter 17: Now on land, Huck walks a few paces before he hears a male voice yelling at him from a nearby house window. Apparently he has reached the Grangerford family headquarters. When asked who he is, Huck tells the man that his name is George Jackson and that he has just fallen off the steamboat. Taking him inside, the man examines Huck by candlelight, convinced that he isn't a Shepherdson, the name of the family with which the Grangerfords are feuding.
	The Grangerford family takes Huck in, and he admits that they were really nice. The ironic thing is, despite their obsession with feuding, the family seems to be very religious. Twain obviously uses this to further his indictment of religion.
	Chapter 18: Huck's education continues. He learns that the Grangerford family is practically part of the aristocracy. The other competing aristocracy in town seems to be the Shepherdsons. The families are feuding, Huck is told, because of some dispute that happened many years ago. When he asks what the nature of the dispute was, no one knows. All of this seems quite ridiculous to Huck.
	Soon word reaches the house that Miss Sophia, the beautiful daughter of the household, has run away to elope with a young man from the Shepherdson family. This immediately causes all the men of the house to fetch their guns and prepare for battle. Traveling with Buck, Huck himself sees the bloodshed first-hand. All of it, however, makes him sick to his stomach, especially when he sees Buck killed.

They ask Huck if they can get away with them, and Huck agrees. Eventually the men announce to each other and to Huck and Jim that they are actually a king and duke, who have lost their kingdoms. Huck doesn't say anything, but he admits to the reader that he thinks ""these liars warn't no kings nor dukes, at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.""
	Chapter 20: Wondering about Jim, the king and duke ask Huck if he's a runaway slave. Huck is adamant in his denial, saying that they wouldn't be traveling south if he were a fugitive slave (They are forced to travel south now because of the current, which of course heads south on the Mississippi.). Huck follows his denial by telling them a compelling story about themselves. Here and elsewhere in the book, it becomes apparent to the reader that Huck is an amazing liar.
	It also soon becomes apparent what the king and duke do for a living: they are frauds and cheats, just as Huck suspected. Stopping at a town downstream, both the king and the duke leave the raft, using their knack for deception to cheat quite a sum of money out of the people.

	The Shakespeare show also takes place this night, but with only a meager turnout, the king and duke change their plan for the next night and put up signs around the town for a show called ""The Royal Nonesuch."" The real appeal of the show is the fact that women and children are prohibited from coming. This will surely cause some excitement, the duke proudly exclaims.
	Chapter 23: The first two nights of the Royal Nonesuch performance takes place in this chapter. What the show really amounts to is simply the duke walking onto stage and telling everyone that they have been duped and asks them to mention the show for the following two evenings to their friends. The people, who have each been conned into paying 50 cents for the ""show,"" are enraged and start to rush stage when one among them calls for them to stop, saying that they will be the ""laughing-stock"" of the town if they don't con their fellow citizens into buying tickets for the following two nights. Everyone agrees, and no violence is done to the king or duke at this time. The following two nights follow the same pattern, except on the third night the duke doesn't dare to enter the stage, knowing that the people plan to get their revenge on him this time. So instead, he and Huck run back to the raft, getting away with over four hundred dollars for the three ""performances.""
	The most important part of the chapter, however, is a conversation between Huck and Jim, when Huck realizes that Jim severely misses his family. This causes Huck to admit, ""I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n."" Thus, Huck continues to realize that Jim is as much a person as anyone else.

Their English accents, for one, don't seem quite authentic to his trained ear. Luckily for the king and duke, however, the town doesn't believe the doctor, but rallies behind them instead.

818,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"Plato begins The Republic by addressing the major theme of his entire work: should man be just or unjust? To discuss this issue, Plato (in the character of Socrates) uses a variety of surrounding characters to give their opinions. Yet he proves each of them wrong in turn. Later, he decides that an answer to the above question can be better found if he first defines the word justice.
	The opening scene begins in the home of Cephalus, where his son, Polemarchus, lives as well. Socrates, together with some of his friends, Glaucon and Adeimantus, enter into a conversation regarding aging. Cephalus tells Socrates that he enjoys his old age, citing his devotion to moderation and proper conduct. Soon the topic of justice flows from this conversation. This inspires Polemarchus and Thrasymachus to consider the nature of justice with Socrates. When Socrates criticizes Polemarchus' idea that man should spite his enemies, Thrasymuchus asserts that those with power have a monopoly over justice- they determine it as they see fit, despite the protests of the powerless. It's the duty of the poor, Thrasymuchas says, to rise up and take what they can from the rich. Yet Socrates attacks this viewpoint as well, saying that the poor should accept the true justice of the government, which is created to aid the governed. He goes on to say that justice is a kind of virtue, or excellence, which yields happiness. When all people accept justice, he maintains, all people can live happily in a cohesive community. Yet Socrates still seems to be seeking a better grasp of this notion of justice himself. Obviously this subject will be revisited throughout The Republic.
	Soon Glaucon presents his views to Socrates, asserting that man should pretend to be just but live unjustly in actuality. This way, he says, man can look virtuous before others without undergoing the toil of living a virtuous life. Socrates seems intrigued by this idea, and decides to use a model polis, or city, to better examine these notions of justice. This city has people who are divides into two classes: those who lead and those who serve. Here, Plato initiates his idea of philosopher kings-- the method in which a perfect city will be organized. The leaders of the city must be of a special breed, having incredible insight that protects the lower classes. They must not look out for their own interests, but live frugally, only considering the interests of the people. Limiting the freedom (or animal instincts) of the populace is crucial to instilling proper virtues. Also, the common laborers must be left in the dark on many issues, because any allusions to unjust living might inspire the people to also be unjust. Plato even says that the guardians can lie to the people if necessary. All forms of information, including literature and music, must be strictly regulated. Even a person's professional training must be carefully monitored by the state. In other words, the government forces its people to be virtuous. Free will is left out of the equation.
	Most importantly, the guardians must emulate the gods, since their special knowledge is divinely inspired. Here, Plato's suggestion seems startling similar to the Hebrew concept of monotheistic law, in which earthly kings maintain God's justice. This notion foreshadows Plato's idea of the Forms, which is discussed later in The Republic.
	Soon, Plato divides the class of rulers (or guardians) further. He asserts that the most senior philosophers should be the head guardians, while the others serve as assistants to these men. The guardians should live in a commune, where individual possessions are restricted. Plato believes that too much wealth will inspire greed and selfishness in the guardians, rendering them unable to rule objectively. Only a rigorous, state-run education system can wean off these animalistic qualities of the rulers, and help them make just laws- laws which mean to enhance the common good. True justice, Plato finally determines, is a result of each member of society doing the work prescribed for his social class. The work should not be done to grow rich, since riches corrupt men, leading them to greedy lives. Plato believes that a moderate amount of money will best suit the people to lives of virtue and justice.
",The Republic
819,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Next, Socrates considers justice on the individual level. Just as the model city is divided into classes, so is the human soul. One part of the soul is ruled by reason, another is ruled by spirit, and a third is ruled by appetite. The reason is derived from the wisdom of the wise elders, or philosopher-kings of the city. The other parts come from more base human instincts. Plato believes in moderation: each part should do its work, but not interfere with the other parts. This is of course parallel to the polis caste system, where class members are not suppose to intrude on the jobs of their superiors.
	Soon, Socrates decides to elaborate on his city of perfection. He continues his description of the communal life by saying that marital monogamy is prohibited. Plato believes that everybody belongs to everybody else. Here, we seem to be reading Huxley's Brave New World.
	To continue this strain, Socrates says that children will be taken by the government at a very early age, and the inferior babies will be left to die while the superior ones will be raised and educated by the government. In promoting this idea of ""one big family,"" Plato intends to break down barriers of class and race, so that the pursuit of virtue can be foremost on everyone's mind. Yet the most important reason for his ""social tampering"" is to ensure the genetic superiority of the ruling class.
	Also, Socrates expounds on his beliefs about war. He strongly discourages war between Greeks (i.e. Sparta vs. Athens) because he believes Greeks have a common identity and natural superiority as a single people. He also encourages the youth of the city to watch the battles to gain experience for future conflicts.
	Soon, Plato expounds on the ruling class. Here, he gets into his ideal of philosopher kings. As alluded to before, Plato asserts that only a philosopher can possess true knowledge, based on the insight of the Forms- unchanging, divine laws that exist in another, imperceptible reality. The true philosopher loves the Forms and finds his deepest satisfaction in discovering and administering them. Here, as stated earlier, Plato touches on the Hebrew idea of monotheistic law. Yet the Hebrews would certainly not accept Plato's Brave New World-ish Utopia.
	Next, Plato defends his philosopher-king idea. He does this by using the metaphor of a sea-faring vessel in which no leadership exists. While many good navigators exist, they are unable to steer the ship because other, more power-hungry individuals, assume control, despite their ignorance. Here, the philosophers are the skilled navigators who never get an opportunity to lead, due to their distaste for politics. This, of course, is how Plato sees the city of Athens at this time.
",The Republic
820,The Republic: Novel Summary: Chapter 3,"In this section of The Republic, Plato begins his description of metaphysical good. Only the Forms, which possess true knowledge, identify this good. Therefore only philosophers (who understand the Forms) can know it. The rest of the population simply holds onto opinions-- imaginative ideas founded in often faulty observation. Soon, Plato illustrates these ideas with the metaphor of the cave. Briefly, this metaphor takes place in a dark cave where everyone is forced to look at one wall. This wall possesses shadows created by puppets in front of the sun, which is the backdrop to the scene and illuminates everyone in its grasp. The sun helps those who feel it to remember the knowledge they have forgotten. The philosopher is the person who escapes the cave and learns to see objects, not as shadows, but as they really are. Thus these gifted philosophers understand true goodness through education and knowledge of the Forms. In this way, Plato answers the ridicule many philosophers receive for seeming disconnected from reality. Indeed they are disconnected from the reality of the shadows- they know a deeper reality-that of the sun.
	Next, Plato details his ideas about the varieties of government, and what causes them to change forms. He says that oligarchy becomes democracy when the upper class becomes motivated by money instead of virtue. Then, the lower class becomes poverty-stricken, causing them to rebel. Plato continues, ""And when the poor win, the result is a democracy."" Since a democracy is little more than anarchy, where man's evil appetites reign supreme over his virtue, the cornerstone of a just society collapses. Soon a strong leader emerges from this chaos, and a dictatorship begins.
	Toward the end of The Republic, Plato addresses the immortality of the human soul. It is this eternal life that makes it possible for humans to learn, since learning is nothing more than remembering knowledge from previous lives. He reasons (through creative rationale) that the soul can never die since it is not inherently evil in itself. He continues by giving a quite long-winded description of a purgatory-type system where the soul is forced to live for one millennium before being reincarnated into another body. Obviously this theory of immortality is quite different from the Hebrew or Christian concept.

821,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"Act 1, scene 1
Richard III begins shortly after Henry VI, part 3, left off. The three Henry VI plays
depicted the struggle between Henry VI (the House of Lancaster) and the Duke of York (the House of York) for the throne of England in England’s Wars of the Roses in the fifteenth century. Henry VI has been killed by Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and succeeded by Edward IV, who is also of the House of York.  Peace has been declared, but Richard now plots to seize the throne for himself, as he explains in his opening soliloquy. To achieve his goal, he must eliminate his rivals. He has managed to convince the king that their brother Clarence is the king’s enemy, and Clarence has been duly arrested.
Clarence enters, guarded. He is being taken to the Tower of London to be imprisoned. Richard feigns ignorance of the situation and asks Clarence what is happening. Clarence explains that he is being imprisoned because his name begins with the letter G (his name is George, Duke of Clarence), and the king has been told that his heirs will be killed by someone whose name begins with G. Richard knows this because he was the one who hatched the plot, but he pretends to know nothing about it. He tells Clarence that it is not the king’s wish that he be imprisoned but that of his wife Elizabeth, the former Lady Grey. Richard says that both Elizabeth and Margaret, the wife of the dead Henry VI,have a lot of power in the court. Richard commiserates with Clarence and promises to visit the king and ensure that he is freed.
After Clarence exits, Richard makes it clear that he is going to arrange for Clarence to be killed.
Lord Hastings enters. He has recently been freed from prison. (He is a supporter of the king but an enemy of the queen, which is why he was imprisoned.) Hastings brings the news that the king is sick. Richard pretends to think that is bad news.
After Hastings exits, Richard, alone, says that Clarence must die before the king does. (He does not want Clarence to have a chance at being crowned king.) He hopes that Clarence will be dead within a day, and that the king will die, leaving Richard a clear route to the throne. He then says he plans to marry Anne Neville, who is the widow of Prince Edward (the son of Henry VI), who was killed by Richard.
 
Analysis
Ideally, the reader or audience of Richard III should also be familiar with the trilogy that preceded it, Henry VI, parts 1, 2, and 3. Otherwise it can be hard to grasp the significance of all the characters and their relationships—like tuning into a TV miniseries just for the last episode. Richard III appears in Henry VI, part 3, and his character is presented from the outset as entirely evil. He already is plotting to seize the throne, and he murders both Prince Edward and Henry VI, when the king is imprisoned in the tower.
Richard’s opening soliloquy in this play is therefore no surprise to anyone who is familiar with how Shakespeare is telling the story of England’s Wars of the Roses. Richard makes no attempt to disguise his own nature in this and other soliloquies. He knows he is ugly (Richard was traditionally described as a hunchback) and has little hope of happiness through love. So he becomes a villain instead, with power his only goal. He is good at scheming, and he knows how to put on a show of rectitude and compassion.
In many of Shakespeare’s tragedies, the main character does not appear in the first scene or two, but minor characters give some clue to the audience as to how he is to be regarded. But not in this play. Richard bounds on stage right at the beginning, a full-fledged villain, completely unapologetic. He knows exactly who he is and what he is about. There is no subtlety here. It is safe to say that Richard III has no redeeming features at all, from the point of view of morality, although his wit and ability to stand back and observe himself constitute a well-developed sense of irony. 
",Richard III
822,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Act 1, scene 2
In a London street, Lady Anne is accompanying the corpse of her father-in-law, Henry VI, to its burial. She curses his killer, whom she knows to be Richard, who also killed her husband. Richard enters, and Anne is horrified. She calls him a devil and tells him to go away. Richard denies that he killed her husband, saying that it was Queen Margaretwho blamed him for the murder. Anne does not believe him and then asks Richard if he killed the king, Henry VI. This Richard does not deny. Anne says he is damned for it; hell is the only place for him.
Richard then takes the initiative and starts to woo Lady Anne. He says the only reason he committed murder was because of her beauty. Anne does not believe him. She just wants her revenge for what he did. Richard counters by saying that he loves her more than her former husband did. She responds by spitting at him. Undeterred, Richard continues to try to flatter and charm her, emphasizing the depth of his feelings for her. He even says that since it appears she cannot forgive him, he will give her his sword with which to kill him. She takes the sword but does not know how to use it properly. He tells her to try again, confessing that he did indeed kill King Henry and Prince Edward, saying he did it because of her beauty. She drops the sword, and he offers then to kill himself, if she should ask it of him. Anne tells him not to. He then offers her a ring, placing it on her finger. Anne appears to be softening in her attitude toward him.
Richard then offers to accompany the king’s body to his final resting place while Anne goes to Crosby House, where he will meet her later. He pretends that he repents of killing the king. Anne believes him and is delighted by his apparent change of heart.
After Anne exits, Richard soliloquizes. He expresses his surprise that he appears to be having some success with Anne, given the circumstances. He admits that he is only half the man that Prince Edward was. But then he changes tack, saying that, well, Lady Anne seems to find him a “marv’lous proper man,” so maybe he should think more highly of himself. He resolves to visit some tailors and get some new outfits.
 
Analysis
Richard shows here that he actually has some of the qualities that he denied possessing in the previous scene. In that scene he claimed not to have the skill of the lover on account of his ugly appearance. But here he is quite confident and indeed shameless in his dealings with Lady Anne. He has the presumption to think that he might have a chance with the woman whose husband he killed. Richard knows how to act a part when it fits in with his goals. He is very persistent in the face of her understandable hostility, and he seems to be able to master the language of courtly love. He even, at the end of the scene, expresses surprise at what he has managed to accomplish. Richard may be a villain, but he is a very self-aware one, and he shows that he is a master at manipulating people, whether in love or politics.
",Richard III
823,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 3,"Act 1, scene 3
At the royal palace, Lord Rivers tells QueenElizabeth that the king will soon recover. Lord Gray tells her to be cheerful around the king, to encourage him. Elizabeth is worried that if the king dies, her son Edward will be under the care of Richard, as Protector. She fears this because she knows Richard is not well disposed toward her and her family.
Buckingham and Stanley enter. They bring hope that the king is recovering. They also say that he wants to effect a reconciliation between Richard and the Queen’s brother (Rivers), and between Richard, Rivers, and Hastings.
Richard enters, demanding to know who is saying that he is not loyal to the king. He is indignant that he could be accused of such a thing. Queen Elizabeth tells him that it is the king himself who knows Richard is hostile to him, his wife, and her family. The Queen says she knows Richard envies the family’s advancement to the throne.
Richard accuses her of causing the imprisonment of Clarence, but she denies this. Richard makes some disparaging remarks to the Queen, and she protests.
Old Queen Margaret, the wife of the dead Henry VI, enters, at first unnoticed. Richard speaks out against the current queen, saying that he advanced the king’s interests in many ways, while she and her then-husband Grey (who is now dead), as well as Rivers, her brother, were actually on the Lancastrian side. He protests about Clarence’s imprisonment, saying that Clarence has always been the king’s supporter.
Rivers protests that they were merely showing their loyalty to the one who was at the time king. He says they would equally be loyal to Richard, should he become king. Richard says he has no desire to be king.
Queen Margaret, who has been speaking in a series of asides, now advances. She upbraids Richard for killing her husband and son and says that everyone in the room owes allegiance to her. Richard responds by reminding her of how his father, the Duke of York, cursed her when she abused and mocked him, and his curse fell upon her. It is, in effect, God who has cursed her, he says. The Queen and everyone else joins in denouncing Queen Margaret. Margaret responds by cursing the king and his son, hoping they will die untimely deaths. Then she curses everyone else present, including Richard, for whom she wishes an even worse fate than the others. She insults him with the most colorful language she can think of (“Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!”). She also warns the Queen that Richard will prove her undoing. She exempts Buckingham from her curses, since he was not involved in killing her family. She also warns Buckingham about Richard, not knowing that Buckingham is Richard’s ally.
Finally, Margaret finishes her curses and exits. Richard pretends to feel remorse for the wrongs done to her. The Queen says she never did anything to harm her, but Richard points out that she has benefited from the wrongs Margaret suffered.
Everyone present is called away because the King wants to see them. Richard remains alone. In a soliloquy, he admits to all his schemes. It is he who is responsible for getting Clarence imprisoned, but he has told Stanley, Hastings, and Buckingham that it is the Queen and her allies who are responsible. Meanwhile, he plots to be revenged on Rivers, Dorset (another son of the Queen), and Grey (also a son of the Queen).
Two murderers enter, hired by Richard. He shows them the death warrant that has been signed by the king, authorizing Clarence’s death.
 
Analysis
Richard continues to glory in his malevolence, and to confide in the audience about it. He is an accomplished liar, and some people seem convinced by his act.
This scene can be a difficult one for those who are unfamiliar with the preceding play, Henry VI, part 3. The events in that play concluded only a few years before the events in Richard III begin. Old Margaret, is, so to speak, a relic from the previous play. Historically, she was in France from 1476 until her death in 1482 and could not have participated in this scene. Perhaps Shakespeare included her here because he wanted to remind his audience of some of the events that took place in Henry VI part 3. This quarrel between the Lancastrians and Yorkists goes back a long way, and like many bitter quarrels, it has left a legacy of hatred and desire for revenge. Historically, Henry VI died in 1471 and Edward IV, who at this stage in Richard III is seriously ill, in 1483. Clarence was executed in 1478. As he often does in his history plays, Shakespeare telescopes events that took place over decades into a smaller time span so he can fit them into his plan with more dramatic economy. 
",Richard III
824,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 4,"Act 1, scene 4
In the Tower of London, Clarence talks with the guard. He says he dreamed the previous night that he had escaped from the Tower and was with Richard sailing for France. But Richard pushed him overboard and he drowned. Entering Hades, the underworld, which is also hell, he encountered other souls there, including his father-in-law, Warwick, who reproached him for turning away from the Lancastrian cause that he had once supported. As devils roared in his ears, Clarence woke up.
Tormented by the sins he believes he has committed for the sake of Edward, the king, Clarence prays to God that if God’s wrath is to fall on him, his wife and children should be spared. Clarence then sleeps.
Brakenbury, the Lieutenant, enters, followed by two murderers. The murderers carry a commission from the king that authorizes them to take charge of Clarence. Brakenbury does not inquire further as to their purpose but hands them the keys to the cell. Brakenbury and the guard exit.
The second murderer confesses to the first one that he is having some pangs of conscience about killing Clarence, even though they have a warrant from the king to do so. The first murderer reminds him of the money that Gloucester has promised them for carrying out the murder, and the other man forgets his misgivings.
Clarence awakes and sees the two men. Alarmed, he guesses they are there to kill him. Clarence asks what his offense is, that he is to be killed for it. He argues that he has not been legally tried and convicted. Therefore, he says, the men face damnation if they kill him, since to do so would be unlawful. The murderers respond that they are acting under the authority of the king, and that Clarence is guilty of supporting the Lancastrian cause. They also say that Clarence is guilty of killing Prince Edward, the son of the former king, Henry VI. Clarence points out that his brother, the current king, is also guilty of that act. Clarence tries to bargain with the murderers, saying they should go to see Richard, who will reward them well for not killing him. The murderers tell him the truth: Richard hates him and wants him dead. Clarence can barely believe this. He continues to try to argue his way out of his fate, but the murderers stab him. If he is still alive they plan to drown him in a butt of malmsey wine. 
The second murderer feels remorse at what they have done.
 
Analysis
Clarence does his best to argue his way out of an impossible situation but he never has a chance. Once again, understanding this scene depends on a knowledge of prior events, which are being to justify his murder. In Henry VI, part 3, Clarence at one point allies himself with Warwick in support of the Lancastrians rather than with his own brother Edward, because Edward did not provide him with a suitable wife. However, after Warwick appeared to renege on a promise to install Clarence as the heir to the throne, Clarence switched sides again, and was forgiven by his brothers Edward and Richard. Following the Battle of Tewksbury, Clarence helped to kill the captured Prince Edward. Now, in this scene, Clarence’s past is coming back to haunt him, although of course his past actions are simply being used as flimsy excuses to justify the murder.
Shakespeare has taken some liberties with history in order to present Richard as being behind Clarence’s death. In reality, Clarence was executed following a legal trial for treason, and the verdict, historians say, was not unjust. The historical Richard, it seems, loyal to his brother, tried to intervene to prevent the execution.

At the royal palace in London, King Edward, who is very sick, presides over a reconciliation between feuding factions. First, Hastings and Rivers, the Queen’s brother, are reconciled. The Queen, her son Dorset, and Buckingham join in the general reconciliation. Richard enters and pledges friendship to all in the room. But then the Queen mentions Clarence’s name, and Richard says Clarence is dead. This is news to everyone, and they are all shocked. The king says that the order to kill Clarence was revoked; Richard responds that the counter order came too late.
Lord Stanley, also known as the Earl of Derby,enters. He asks the King if the life of a servant of his might be spared, even though he killed a man. The King responds by musing on the life of Clarence, regretting his death. He recalls how Clarence, after he forsook Warwick’s cause, remained loyal to him. And yet, the King says, no one came to him to plead for Clarence’s life, and now even a servant has someone pleading for his. He grants the favor to Stanley.
The King and Queen and others exit, leaving Richard and Buckingham. Richard tries to blame the Queen’s family for Clarence’s death.
 
Analysis
As the King’s death approaches, there is antagonism between the Queen’s family, the Woodvilles, and those who are more loyal to the King’s side of the family. Dorset and Rivers, for example, are Woodvilles, whereas Hastings and Buckingham are loyal to the king. Richard of course merely pretends to be part of the general reconciliation. Motivated only by personal ambition, he is against anyone who is likely to obstruct his path to power; it doesn’t matter which side of the family they are on.
Historically, the marriage of the widow Lady Grey, formerly Elizabeth Woodville, to Edward IV, by which she became Queen, allowed the Woodville family to gain a lot of power in the land. Some of the more established lords resented this, and regarded the Woodvilles as upstarts.

The Duchess of York, the mother of Edward, Clarence, and Richard, mourns the death of Clarence. She talks to Clarence’s two young children, Edward and Margaret. The boy tells his grandmother that Richard told him the king was to blame for Clarence’s death, but the duchess knows better. She knows that Richard is full of deceit. Queen Elizabeth enters, with Rivers and Dorset. The Queen announces that the King is dead. Both women mourn their loss. Dorset and Rivers try to comfort the Queen. Rivers advises her to send for Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, immediately and have him crowned king.
Richard, Buckingham, Stanley, Hastings, and Ratcliffe enter. Richard offers his comfort to both women but offers a cynical aside. Buckingham is anxious to preserve the recently established unity between the quarreling factions. He advises that the prince should be brought from Ludlow to London accompanied only by a very small escort, because too big an entourage might antagonize those elements that are still opposed to the Yorkist supremacy. Richard and Rivers agree to this plan. When Buckingham and Richard are left alone, they plot to separate the prince from the Queen and her family.
 
Analysis
The death of the King is obviously good news for Richard, who is prepared to make an ally of Buckingham to achieve his goal. Shakespeare, as he does throughout the play, spurns no opportunity to blacken Richard’s character, as here when the grandson of the duchess unwittingly reveals Richard’s hypocrisy and lies. Richard, the boy reports, told him it was the king who was responsible for imprisoning Clarence, the boy’s father, and offered the boy every sympathy: “he wept, / And pitied me, and kindly kissed my cheek; / Bade me rely on him as on my father, / And he would love me dearly as a child.” Even Richard’s mother knows this is just a pretense and that her own son is full of lies and malice.

Edward, the young Prince of Wales, arrives in London. He is greeted by Richard, Buckingham, and others. The prince says he wants more of his uncles there, but Richard tells him that the men he is referring to were false friends. The prince does not believe him, however.
Hastings arrives with the news that the Queen and her son, the prince’s brother, have sought sanctuary. The boy wanted to come to meet his brother, but the Queen refused to let him go. Buckingham tells Cardinal Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, to persuade the Queen to send her son to London, by force if necessary. The Cardinal protests that it would be a sin to take him against his mother’s will, since they have sought sanctuary, but Buckingham replies that sanctuary does not apply to children, since they do not freely choose or claim it.
Richard tells the Prince of Wales that he, the prince, will be staying for a few days in the Tower of London. The prince says he does not want to stay there.
Hastings arrives with Richard, the young Duke of York, the Prince of Wales’s brother. York speaks with a thinly disguised hostility to Richard, and when he learns that he and his brother are to be staying at the Tower, he expresses his displeasure. Richard asks him what he fears, and York replies the ghost of Clarence, since he has heard that his uncle was murdered there. The two boys, however, agree to go to the Tower.
Everyone exits except for Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby. Buckingham suggests that York is hostile to Richard because his mother the Queen put him up to it. Buckingham then consults Catesby about the plan to install Richard as king. Buckingham asks Catesby about Hastings. Could he be persuaded to support them? Catesby says that Hastings is a strong supporter of the former king and therefore of his son. Buckingham then inquires about Stanley. Catesby replies that Stanley will follow whatever Hastings does. Buckingham sends Catesby to sound out Hastings and see if he can be persuaded to support their plan. Richard then tells Catesby to inform Hastings that Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan, Hastings’s enemies, have been executed at Pomfret.
After Catesby exits, Buckingham asks Richard what they will do if Hastings refuses to support them. Richard gives a blunt reply: cut off his head. He tells Buckingham that when he, Richard, is king, he will make Buckingham the Earl of Hereford, as well as giving him all the former king’s personal property.
 
Analysis
This scene briefly alludes to the historical fact that after Edward IV’s death, Richard was named Protector, as Edward had requested. This is why Prince Edward in this scene refers to Richard as Lord Protector (line 160). It was no surprise that Richard was appointed to this position. As Peter Saccio explains in Shakespeare’s English Kings, “Richard was, after all, the only surviving adult male in the house of York, a loyal, long-tested prop of the Yorkist throne, and the most powerful man in the realm” (p. 169).
Richard efficiently goes about eliminating his enemies. If Hastings cannot be won over, he must be killed, just as Rivers and his associates (all supporters of the Queen and the Woodville family) are to be executed. So keen is Shakespeare to keep the villainy of Richard front and center that he foreshadows, in this scene, the fate the two princes will meet in the Tower. This comes in lines 89-90, when Richard says in an aside, after he has been speaking with the young Prince of Wales, “So wise so young, they say, do never live long.”

830,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 2,"Act 3, scene 2
At Lord Hastings’ house, a messenger arrives from Stanley early in the morning. As a result of a dream, Stanley is worried about the threat he perceives from Richard. He wants Hastings to accompany him to the north, to escape the danger. Hastings dismisses Stanley’s fears, saying that he, Hastings, will hear soon enough (from his friend Catesby) about anything that is said concerning them at an upcoming council Richard has convened. He is confident they have nothing to fear.
Catesby enters on his mission from Richard and informs Hastings that Richard is plotting to seize the crown. He says Richard has sent him with this news, wanting to know whether Hastings will support him. Catesby also mentions that the three noble prisoners at Pomfret are to be executed. Hastings does not care about the executions, since Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan are his enemies, but he says he would rather die than allow Richard to win the crown. Hastings, however, is not troubled by the news. He feels secure, believing that Richard and Buckingham are his friends.
Stanley enters, and says he feels uneasy about the current situation, but Hastings reassures him that there is nothing to worry about. Hastings remains confident as he talks to a pursuivant (a messenger) and to a clergyman. Then Buckingham enters and informs Hastings of the impending deaths at Pomfret. Buckingham and Hastings both go to the Tower.
 
Analysis
Hastings is almost comically overconfident and shows that he has completely misjudged Richard. He has no idea at all of the depths of the man’s malevolence, and even thinks him to be a friend. Hastings’ gullibility is also a tribute to the charming face that Richard can put on when he wants to disguise his real purposes.
",Richard III
831,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 3,"Act 3, scene 3
At Pomfret Castle, Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan are led to their deaths. They all speak defiant words to Sir Richard Ratcliffe, who is supervising the executions. Rivers recalls that it was at the same castle that Richard II was murdered. Grey and Rivers recall the curse uttered by Margaret, Henry VI’s wife (this is a reference to Act 1, scene 3), on everyone who had wronged her, including them. Rivers implores God also to have vengeance on the others who were cursed by Margaret, including Richard, Buckingham, and Hastings.
 
Analysis
This is a small glimpse of one theme of the play, that of retribution. Rivers cannot know that Hastings will within a few days pay the same price as he, Rivers, is now paying. Ultimately, however, it is not the curse of one person that is worked out in the play, but the divine retribution that will eventually fall on Richard for his evil deeds (at least that is how Shakespeare will present it the resolution of the play). 
",Richard III
832,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 4,"Act 3, scene 4
Buckingham, Stanley, Hastings, the Bishop of Ely, and others, hold a council meeting. The purpose is to make plans for the upcoming coronation. Richard has not yet arrived, but Hastings is confident that he can speak for Richard. Richard then arrives, and when Buckingham tells him that Hastings was prepared to speak on his behalf, Richard expresses no displeasure, saying that Hastings knows him well.
Richard then takes Buckingham aside and informs him that Hastings is not prepared to support Richard in his claim to the throne. The two men exit.
Hastings remarks to Stanley that Richard holds no enmity for anyone in the room; had he done so, Hastings says, he, Hastings, would have seen it in Richard’s face.
Richard returns and reports a plot on his life. The Queen and Jane Shore (Edward IV’s mistress) practiced witchcraft against him, he says. Hastings makes the mistake of not immediately acknowledging the reality of the plot. He says that “if” they are guilty, but Richard interrupts him and accuses him of protecting Jane Shore. That makes him a traitor, and Richard orders his immediate execution. Richard exits, leaving Hastings to lament his fate and that of his country. He realizes he should have acted sooner and taken Stanley’s warning more seriously. Like the victims at Pomfret, just before his death he recalls the curse of Margaret.
 
Analysis
Once again Shakespeare draws attention to Hastings’s overconfidence and poor judgment of character. By doing so he makes the moment when Richard pounces more dramatically effective. Historically, Hastings was not quite as innocent as he appears in this play. He did plot with the Queen and her relatives to overturn the stipulation in Edward’s will that Richard should be made Protector. But of course, an innocent Hastings makes better drama because it better shows up the villainy of Richard. 
",Richard III
833,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 5,"Act 3, scene 5
Richard and Buckingham enter, both dressed in rusty armor and looking like men who have been in battle for their lives. The mayor of London and Catesby enter, quickly followed by Lovel and Radcliffe, who holds the head of Hastings. Lovel says Hastings was a traitor, and Richard makes a big show of how much he loved Hastings and would never have suspected him of such a deed. Gloucester tells the mayor that Hastings was plotting to kill both him and Richard that very day. Richard adds that not only were their own lives at risk, but so was the peace of England. Buckingham pretends to the mayor that they would sooner have waited until the mayor had had a chance to hear Hastings confess his crimes, and then the mayor could have explained the situation to the citizens, who otherwise might misconstrue what happened and lament Hastings’ death and blame Richard and Buckingham.
The mayor is convinced that Hastings must have been guilty. He says he will convey this to the citizens.
Richard tells Buckingham to go after the mayor and to the Guildhall and when the time is right, say that Edward IV’s children are illegitimate. Moreover, Richard says, Buckingham must insinuate that Edward himself was illegitimate, having been conceived at a time when Richard’s father, the Duke of York, was at war in France.
Richard then sets in motion a plan to hide the children of Clarence and make sure that no one gets to see the two princes in the Tower.
 
Analysis
Shakespeare follows his sources in respect of the illegitimacy of Edward’s children. It had been reported that Edward had engaged in a secret premarriage contract with Lady Eleanor Butler before his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville. Such a contract was considered legally binding, so his marriage to Elizabeth was invalid and the children of that marriage illegitimate. However, since Eleanor was now dead, such a contract could not be proven.
The charge that Edward himself was illegitimate is not taken seriously by modern historians, who do however note that it was a story that circulated at the time, propagated by both Warwick and Clarence. In the play, Richard has little compunction about tarring his mother’s reputation in this way. 
",Richard III
834,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 6,"Act 3, scene 6
A scrivener enters with the indictment of Hastings that is to be read that day in St. Paul’s Cathedral. The scrivener says he has spent eleven hours copying it after it was sent to him the previous night by Catesby. The scrivener guesses that the charges against Hastings are false, but he also doubts whether anyone will have the courage to say so.
 
Analysis
This scene hints at an atmosphere of fear in the land. The powerful can literally get away with murder. It bodes ill for the country. 
",Richard III
835,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 7,"Act 3, scene 7
At Beynard’s Castle in London, Buckingham reports back to Richard about what he has achieved. He reported at the Guildhall that Edward and his children were illegitimate, citing Edward’s betrothal to two different women before he married Elizabeth—to a Lady Lucy and then to a French noblewoman, a match that was negotiated by Warwick and the King of France. Then Buckingham lauded the virtues of Richard. At the end, he invited his audience to cry “God save Richard, England’s royal king!” But no one uttered a word in response. Buckingham gets the mayor to repeat his speech, but again, no one acclaims Richard as king, save a few of Buckingham’s own supporters at the end of the hall.
The mayor has now come to the castle, and Buckingham has a plan: Richard is to be unavailable until he is persuaded reluctantly to appear. He must have clergymen with him. Then Buckingham will praise Richard’s piety, but Richard must not immediately accept what Buckingham and his supporters are urging him to do.
The mayor enters with a crowd of citizens, followed by Catesby. Catesby says that Richard is engrossed in meditation with the clergymen; they should visit him another day. Buckingham tells Catesby to make another request to Richard, saying it is important that they should see him. Catesby exits.
Buckingham praises Richard’s piety to the mayor, contrasting him favorably with the former king, who had a reputation for lechery. Buckingham says Richard would make a good king, but he fears that Richard will not accept the crown if it is offered to him.
Catesby reenters, saying that Richard wonders why they are all assembled there, and he fears they mean him ill. Buckingham tells Catesby to reassure Richard on that point.
Finally, Richard appears, between two bishops. Catesby also returns. Buckingham once more praises Richard’s piety, and Richard apologizes for keeping them waiting. He asks them what they want. Buckingham gives a long speech in which he urges Richard to take the crown because otherwise the country will languish under illegitimate rule. He insists that Richard has a right to inherit the throne.
Richard thanks him but declines, citing his unworthiness. He claims humility, and the knowledge that his flaws are too great to permit him to be king. He then says there is no need for a new king, since there is an heir who as he matures will prove a capable king. Buckingham responds by pointing out that Edward’s children are not legitimate, and therefore the crown is rightfully inherited by Richard. The mayor and Catesby urge him to accept. But Richard repeats that he is unworthy and cannot do as they say. Buckingham responds by once more lavishly praising Richard and saying that if he does not accept the crown, he, Buckingham, and others, will place someone else on the throne, not Edward V, but someone whose rule will result in Richard’s downfall.
All but Richard and Catesby exit. Catesby urges Richard to call them back. Richard finally gives in. Catesby calls them back, and Richard tells Buckingham and the rest that he will accept the crown, even though he does not want to. Buckingham salutes him as King Richard and says they will crown him tomorrow.
 
Analysis
The Lady Lucy that Buckingham mentions in this scene is a reference to Elizabeth Lucy, a mistress of Edward IV before he became king. But historically it was not Lucy with whom Edward made a marriage precontract with, if indeed he did so with any woman.
The second part of the scene, after the mayor and the citizens enter at line 61 is an example of dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience, or some of the characters, know things about the situation or the motivation of the characters that either all or some of the characters do not know. In this scene the audience knows what the mayor and the citizens do not, that this is an elaborate sham perpetrated by Buckingham and Richard. They are both good actors, conspiring to present Richard as a pious man who is so humble he feels he does not deserve the office of king and has to be repeatedly persuaded to accept. Buckingham and Richard play their parts to perfection. They have to, because as the first part of the scene showed, Richard does not in fact enjoy much public support.

836,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 1,"Act 4, scene 1
Outside the Tower, the Queen, her son Dorset, the Duchess of York, Richard’s wife Anne, and Clarence’s daughter have come to visit the two princes. But the Lieutenant Brakenbury will not let them in, on the orders of Richard. The Queen and the duchess protest, to no avail.
Stanley enters and tells Anne that she must come with him to Westminster to be crowned Richard’s queen. She is heartily displeased at this news.
The Queen, knowing that Richard’s accession means more trouble for her family, tells Dorset to join the Duke of Richmond in France (Henry Tudor) where he has taken refuge. Anne rehearses the story of her wooing by Richard, and describes a marriage she bitterly regrets. She has never slept well because Richard is always being awakened by bad dreams. She believes Richard hates her and will soon dispose of her. She also tells the Queen to seek sanctuary.
 
Analysis
This is the first mention in this play of Henry Tudor, the Earl of Richmond. He is the future Henry VII who will soon put an end to the Wars of the Roses and unite the two houses of York and Lancaster. In Henry VI, part 3, Henry was still a boy, and he was sent to Brittany, France, to keep him safe.
",Richard III
837,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 2,"Act 4, scene 2
Richard has been crowned king. He confides in Buckingham that his wish is to have the two princes in the Tower killed. Buckingham says he needs time to think about this, which does not please Richard, who decides that he will no longer confide in him about his plans.
Richard tells Catesby to start a rumor that Anne, his wife, is sick and may die. He also wants to get Clarence’s daughter married off to some inconsequential man who will present no threat to him. After Catesby exits, Richard says that he wants to marry Edward IV’s daughter, Elizabeth, to give him a firmer grip on the throne.
Richard then hires a man named James Tyrrel to kill the two princes.
Buckingham reenters. He tries to talk to Richard about the subjectRichard raised earlier, but Richard has his mind on the developing political situation. He is worried about an alliance between Dorset and Richmond. Buckingham wants reassurance that he will receive the earldom of Hereford and the personal property of Edward VII, just as Richard had promised him, but Richard is in no mood to listen. He is worrying about a prophecy made by Henry VI that Richmond would become king, and also a prediction made by a bard in Ireland that Richard would not live long after he saw Richmond. Buckingham broaches the subject again but Richard does not want to be bothered by it.
Richard exits, and Buckingham decides to flee to Brecknock before he meets the same fate as Hastings.
 
Analysis
Richard is utterly immoral and ruthless but also impresses the audience with his cold efficiency as well. He is completely aware of all aspects of the political situation and determined to arrange everything to his own advantage. He may be king but he is certainly not secure while the two princes live, especially Edward, the elder son of Edward IV, whom many would regard as the legitimate heir. If he can get Edward killed, neutralize any possible challenge from a husband to Clarence’s daughter by ensuring that she marries someone of no significance, and then himself marry his brother’s daughter, Elizabeth, he will be set fair. Obviously on his mind, though, is the threat presented by Richmond, who also has a claim to the throne.

838,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 3,"Act 4, scene 3
Tyrrel enters. He hired two ruffians who have killed the two princes in the Tower. Richard enters and Tyrrel gives him the news. Richard asks whether he actually saw them dead, and he says yes. The corpses are buried, he says, but he does not know where.
Tyrrel exits, and Richard reviews the situation: Clarence’s son is imprisoned; Clarence’s daughter is married to a man of no account; Edward’s sons are dead; Anne is dead, or as good as (he gives no details). All that remains is for him to marry Elizabeth, which he must do speedily, since Richmond also has designs  on her.
Ratcliffe enters with the news that Morton, the Bishop of Ely, has joined Richmond, and Buckingham has raised an army against Richard. Richard is more troubled by the developing strength of Richmond than he is by Buckingham. He decides to act quickly and tells Ratcliffe to raise an army.
 
Analysis
Events are moving swiftly now and most appear to be in Richard’s favor. But he has reason to be worried about Richmond and is not yet secure on the throne. Needless to say, his malevolence has reached new heights with the murder of the young princes. Only on the throne for a short while, he has become a bloodthirsty tyrant. 
",Richard III
839,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 4,"Act 4, scene 4
In front of the palace, Queen Margaret, Henry VI’s widow enters. She is about to depart for France but hides when she hears the Duchess of York and the Queen approaching. They are both mourning their losses. Margaret then comes forward and tells them to listen to the story of her own misfortunes, which have been many. She wants revenge on Richard and prays to God that he may die.
After Margaret exits, Richard enters. He is at the head of an army. The two women (his mother and his former sister-in-law) accuse and curse him. His mother tells him that he “camest on earth to make the earth my hell.” She curses him again and says she is praying that his enemies will be victorious. He will meet a bloody end, she says.
After the Duchess exits, Richard tells the Queen that he must talk to her about her daughter, Elizabeth. The Queen immediately thinks that the girl’s life must be in danger. She resolves to say anything to save her, including the claim that she is not really Edward’s daughter. She denounces Richard, while he insists that his intentions are not at all what she thinks. He says he will bring good to the Queen and to her daughter. Eventually he gets round to saying that he loves Elizabeth and wants to marry her. The Queen is incredulous and mocks him, but Richard tries to answer all her objections. He says he will forgive Dorset (her son) and the other rebels and give them all high office. Then he asks the Queen to go to her daughter and explain Richard’s intentions. The Queen asks him more questions to test his sincerity. She is skeptical and hostile to him but finally agrees to go to her daughter and get her to listen to his proposal. After the Queen exits, Richard makes a contemptuous remark about her.
Ratcliffe and Catesby enter. Ratcliffe says that Richmond’s powerfularmy is sailing for England, hoping when they land to connect with Buckingham’s forces.
Richard tells Ratcliffe and Catesby to round up support from the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Salisbury.
Stanley enters and confirms the news about Richmond, who is coming to England to claim the crown. Richard speaks harshly to him, doubting his loyalty, but Stanley says he will round up his forces and meet up with Richard wherever the king wants. Richard still does not trust him. He insists that Stanley leave his son behind. If Stanley should prove unfaithful to Richard’s cause, his son will be executed. Stanley exits.
Messengers enter with the news that the rebel forces are getting stronger as more men of substance in different parts of England join their cause. Buckingham’s army has been dispersed but no one knows where Buckingham himself is. There is a rumor that Richmond’s fleet has been destroyed by a storm and he is on his way back to Brittany. But this is soon discounted by another messenger who brings the news that Richmond has landed at Milford (this is Milford Haven in Wales) with a large army. The messenger also says that Buckingham has been captured. Richard resolves to march to Salisbury, and order that Buckingham be brought there.
 
Analysis
Richard here offers something of a reprise of the scene in Act 1, when he succeeded in wooing Lady Anne, despite the fact that he killed her husband. In this scene Richard is in an immeasurably more powerful position and his unfortunate former sister-in-law, Elizabeth, is in the end left with little choice but to go along with the wishes of the man who has just killed her two sons. Richard of course makes promises about pardoning the rebels that he has no intention of keeping. Not constrained by any integrity, Richard says in any situation the words he considers most likely to advance his ambition and lust for power.

840,Richard III: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 5,"Act 4, scene 5
At Stanley’s house, Stanley tells Sir Christopher Urswick to tell Richmond that he cannot send aid to Richmond at the moment because Richard is holding his son hostage. Sir Christopher says that Richmond is in Pembroke in Wales, and he names all the men of substance who have joined Richmond’s cause. They are making their way to London.
 
Analysis
This scene shows that Richard was right not to trust Stanley. He had good cause, too, since Stanley’s wife is Richmond’s mother (by Henry Tudor) and therefore Stanley is Richmond’s stepfather. Therefore refusing to allow Stanley’s son to leave was a good move, from Richard’s point of view. Nonetheless, the list of his enemies seems to grow by the minute.

Buckingham is being led to his execution. He has asked to see Richard, but Richard has refused. Buckingham is resigned to his fate. He realizes he has acted wrongly by siding with Richard, plotting with him, and thereby betraying Edward IV’s family.
 
Analysis
In his portrayal of Buckingham, Shakespeare follows his sources, in this case the historian Edward Hall. It was Hall who wrote that Buckingham turned against Richard because Richard reneged on a promise to create him earl of Hereford. Historically, this is untrue; Richard did keep his promise in that respect (although Shakespeare was not to know this). Modern historians have reached no firm conclusions about why Buckingham mounted his rebellion so soon after helping Richard to the crown. Whatever the reason, he had no success. Plagued by bad weather, his army deserted him. He was executed on November 2, 1483.

Analysis
This is Richmond’s first appearance in the play. He is presented as a man who comes to overthrow a tyrant and has the welfare of England in mind. He does not act out of personal ambition.

At Bosworth Field, the two armies are encamped. Richard enters with some of his men. Norfolk says the enemy army numbers six or seven thousand men. Richard says he has three times that number. He calls on the men to pitch their tents, for the battle will be tomorrow.
They exit, and Richmond and some of his men enter. Richmond plans his tactics for the battle. He gives Blunt a note to take to Stanley, who is encamped just south of the king’s forces. Richmond and his men withdraw into their tent.
Richard, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, and Catesby enter. It is nine o’clock in the evening. Richard sends a message to Stanley, to bring his army up before sunrise, or his son will die. Richard feels uneasy, and sends for ink and paper. He then withdraws alone into his tent.
Stanley enters and addresses Richmond. Stanley says he will aid Richmond in the battle but cannot be too overt about it, owing to the predicament of his son. After Stanley exits, Richmond is left alone. He prays to God for success in the next day’s battle and then sleeps.
The Ghost of Prince Edward, Henry VI’s son, appears to Richard in a dream and reminds him of how he, Richard, stabbed him to death when he was a young boy. The Ghost tells him to despair, and die. The Ghost then appears to Richmond in a dream. He tells him to be cheerful because the souls of all those who have been wronged will fight on his behalf.
The Ghost of Henry VI appears to Richard. He too was killed by Richard, and like the Ghost of Prince Edward, he now tells Richard to despair and die. The Ghost then appears to Richmond and comforts him, describing him as virtuous and holy, and saying he will be victorious.
The Ghost of Clarence appears to Richard. He reminds Richard of his responsibility in Clarence’s death and has the same message for him that the other Ghosts have had: despair and die. To Richmond, he says that although Richmond is of the House of Lancaster, all the wronged members of the House of York pray for him.
The parade of Ghosts continues: Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan; then Hastings, then the two princes, then Anne, Richard’s wife; then finally Buckingham. Each delivers the same message: shame and death to Richard, divine protection and victory for Richmond.
The Ghosts vanish and Richard awakes. He is deeply disturbed by his dream and he confesses his fear to Radcliffe. The ghosts in his dream have scared him more than the army of Richmond ever could.
Meanwhile, in Richmond’s tent, he has awoken with good feelings following his dream. He gives an oration to his soldiers. He tells them that God is on their side. Richard is a tyrant and a murderer, and even his own army would sooner that Richmond wins the battle. Richmond tells them that if they fight against God’s enemy, God will guard them.
Richard cheers himself up with the knowledge that Richmond has never been formally trained in the use of arms. Norfolk enters, with the news that the enemy is already in the field. Richard orders that Stanley bring up his forces, and issues his final instructions for the battle. He gives an oration to his army in which he denounces Richmond’s army as a bunch of vagabonds and foreigners. He appeals to their patriotism.
A messenger arrives with the news that Stanley refuses to come. Richard gives the order for the execution of Stanley’s son, but Norfolk says that since the enemy is already so close, the execution can wait until after the battle.
 
Analysis
This scene clearly shows the stark conflict between good and evil that is now playing out in the civil war in England. After he has dreamed of the ghosts, Richard at last shows a smidgeon of remorse: “O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!” But Richard has never been under any illusions about himself. He has always known he is a villain and a murderer. His conscience is now pricked by fear, rather than any moral awakening. Richmond, in contrast, is presented as an avenger sent by God. He is the agent of divine providence.

In part this will be accomplished by Richmond’s marriage to Elizabeth. He looks forward to peace in the kingdom.
 
Analysis
In his final speech Richmond evokes the horror of civil war that has afflicted the kingdom for so long. He is determined to put an end to it and inaugurate a new era of peace. After the Battle of Bosworth Field Richmond was crowned Henry VII. Richmond’s speech here is a reflection of what is known as the Tudor view of history. The historians of the Tudor period that Henry VII inaugurated viewed him as a savior sent by God to rescue the nation from civil war. Building Henry VII and his successors up in this way, they also denigrated Richard III, presenting him as evil beyond redemption, a view Shakespeare followed in this play.

When the reason for the plague is discovered, Agamemnon becomes angry and defiant, unhappy to give the daughter back to her father to appease Apollo.  Achilles, a superior Greek warrior, challenges Agamemnon's arrogance, but Agamemnon turns his anger to Achilles, and demands that Achilles give a slave girl to him as a compensation.  Achilles fills with rage, but Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, calms both men down so that they do not fight with swords.  Instead they argue, and Achilles withdraws from the Greek camp, refusing to fight until Agamemnon apologizes.

Chapter 1: Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Summary: On a morning in 1879, John Watson, M.D., awakes to find the private detective Sherlock Holmes, with whom he shares lodgings at 221-B Baker Street, unexpectedly seated at the breakfast table. Holmes invites Watson to examine a walking stick left behind by an unmet visitor the previous night. What, Holmes wonders, can Watson deduce about the stick’s owner? Watson hazards his observations, only to have them clarified and corrected by Holmes, his deductive superior. Shortly thereafter, the walking stick’s owner, one James Mortimer, M.R.C.S. (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons), arrives. After exclaiming his delight at having the chance to observe Holmes’ skull (for he has heard of the detective’s brilliant intellect), he proceeds to tell Holmes and Watson why he is seeking the master detective’s help.
Analysis: Having grown tired of writing the adventures of the world’s first consulting detective and eager to turn his attention to more “serious” literature, Arthur Conan Doyle attempted to finish off his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, by sending him over the Reichenbach Falls as the detective grappled with his archnemesis, Professor Moriarty, in a short story entitled “The Final Problem” (December 1893). The title would, of course, prove overly optimistic! Enthusiastic readers of the Holmes tales clamored for the sleuth’s return. Conan Doyle obliged with The Hound of the Baskervilles, the third—and still hailed by many critics as the best—Sherlock Holmes novel. Conan Doyle did, however, carefully label the book as “another adventure” of Holmes of the first edition’s title page—an indication that the events in its pages took place prior to “The Final Problem,” and that the reading public should not expect any further stories. When the novel proved an instant success, however, readers pressed for more. Conan Doyle relented and engineered Holmes’ “resurrection” in 1903.
The first chapter of the present work appropriately bears Holmes’ name as its title, for it is largely a brief character sketch of the detective, introducing him or reintroducing him to the book’s audience through the eyes of his erstwhile companion, Dr. John Watson. The chapter also introduces James Mortimer, an adherent of phrenology, the now-discredited belief prevalent in Victorian science, that study of the shape of the skull indicates mental capacity and even moral character. “You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes,” Mortimer announces. “I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic [i.e., relatively long] a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital [i.e., above the eyeballs] development” (p. 18). The comment is exactly the kind of thing one would expect a self-professed (and perhaps not a little self-important) “dabbler in science” to say (p. 18). Mortimer also manages the relatively uncommon feat of being able to wound Holmes’ pride when he declares Holmes “the second highest expert in Europe” (p. 19). Mortimer ranks Holmes behind Alphonse Bertillon, “chief of criminal investigation for the Paris police from 1880” (Klinger, 397). Bertillon’s method of photographing and measuring the distinctive physical traits of criminal suspects—in profile and full-on views, the basis for the modern “mug shot”—proved highly influential in police practice worldwide, only to be superseded by the advent of fingerprinting at the turn of the 20th century. Fortunately for Mortimer, his conviction that Holmes remains the most knowledgeable “practical man of affairs” (p. 19) ensures that Holmes will give Mortimer’s case a hearing.
Mortimer demurs when Holmes addresses him as “doctor.” According to Klinger, Mortimer’s M.R.C.S. credentials are today “regarded as a specialist higher qualification in surgery, awarded to doctors who have already qualified in their profession and have elected to practice in the surgical branch of it… In Mortimer’s day [, however], the M.R.C.S. was the surgical half of the standard qualification to practice, not an advanced degree, and surgeons in fact occupied a lower position in the medical hierarchy than physicians, who diagnosed patients and prescribed medication” (pp. 388-89).
 
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
859,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 2 - 5," 
Summary: Mortimer reads to Holmes and Watson an early 18th-century manuscript that tells of how, in the time of the “Great Rebellion” [i.e., 1641-51], Hugo Baskerville, progenitor of the ancient and wealthy Baskerville line and a “wild, profane and godless man,” kidnapped the maiden daughter of a yeoman who held lands near his estate. For this crime, the document claims, Hugo Baskerville died, ravaged by “a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.” The Baskervilles thus believe a curse has been placed upon their family. Holmes dismisses the story, but is more intrigued when Mortimer reads a recent newspaper account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. A generous philanthropist and a potential candidate for Parliament in an upcoming election, Sir Charles (descendant, of course, of the notorious Hugo) had restored much of his famly’s greatness after it had fallen upon hard times by capitalizing on financial speculations in South Africa. A widower, Sir Charles lived only with his servants at Baskerville Hall, a married couple, the Barrymores, who worked as butler and housekeeper. He lived near Mortimer, who was his personal physician; as well as one Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and Mr. Stapleton, a naturalist. Sir Charles was keenly interested in the legend of the Baskerville curse, asking Mortimer several times whether he ever saw or heard strange creatures and noises, especially “the baying of a hound.” Each night before retiring to bed, Sir Charles would walk the Hall’s “famous yew alley.” He never returned from that walk on the evening of May 4; at midnight, Mr. Barrymore found his master lying dead at the alley’s end, past its gate that opens onto the moor surrounding the Hall. Sir Charles’ face wore a terrifyingly distorted expression (attributed in the autopsy to cardiac exhaustion). Barrymore noted that the appearance of Sir Charles’ footprints altered once he had passed that gate, but reported no other physical clues to the inquest. Information that the newspaper account does not include, but what Mortimer now tells Holmes, is that, three weeks prior to Sir Charles’ death, Mortimer had visited the nobleman and caught a glimpse of some large, unknown black animal—the sight of which visibly shook Sir Charles. Furthermore, in the yew-alley, Mortimer saw the “fresh and clear” footprints of a gigantic hound.
Analysis: Conan Doyle effectively creates a mood of suspense and fear in this chapter: even though it is set in Holmes and Watson’s Baker Street apartment, it is filled with evocative, atmospheric descriptions of Baskerville Hall, the site of strange—and, perhaps, supernatural—occurrences. The novel is a work of mystery, not horror; nevertheless, this chapter contains elements that might equally be at home in a Gothic tale of terror: the ancient family manor, recently refurbished but still bearing marks of “evil days” gone by (p. 26); a secret, shameful family history in the tale of Hugo Baskerville and his fellow drunken revelers who are struck by terror on the moonlit moors, only to be pursued by evil and misfortune until their (sometimes untimely) deaths; and, of course, our first description of the titular hound, with “its blazing eyes and dripping jaws” (p. 24)—“such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels” (p. 23). The circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death, as well, laid out in careful detail by Conan Doyle as he sets the stage for the detective tale to follow, inspire feelings of dread, which culminate in Mortimer’s nearly whispered revelation that he has seen “the footprints of a gigantic hound” (p. 30). (Indeed, we will read at the beginning of the next chapter that Mortimer’s words gave Watson, a man of science, “a shudder,” p. 31!) Some critics have pointed out that, in real life, one cannot tell the breed of dog merely from its pawprints; but, as Baker Street Journal editor Edgar W. Smith noted, Mortimer’s frequently quoted, chapter-concluding line is all about maximum artistic impact: “I remember one of my sons, when he was very young, going about the house muttering: ‘Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic cocker-spaniel!’ That, I am sure, would not have had quite the same dramatic effect…” (Klinger, p. 414).
 
Chapter 3: The Problem
Summary: Holmes questions Mortimer and establishes that the dog he saw was not a sheep dog; that the wicket-gate is the only exit from the yew-alley that leads to the moor, and that Sir Charles had apparently stood there for some time; that the hound’s footprints were clearly on the path and not on the surrounding grass; and that three people report having seen the hound prior to Sir Charles’ death, but none have reported seeing it since. For all this attention to the details of the night in question, however, Mortimer reveals that he does not wish Holmes to investigate Sir Charles’ death. Rather, he has approached the detective for advice about what to do when Sir Charles’ only heir, one Henry Baskerville, returns from abroad. (The only other kinsman was one Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’ youngest brother and “the black sheep of the family,” who is reported to have died in Central America in 1876.) Mortimer wants the charitable work begun by Sir Charles to continue, and knows that, to that end, Baskerville Hall must have a squire; but he does not want Sir Henry to go to Baskerville Hall for fear of the curse upon the family. Holmes is, of course, deeply skeptical of all such supernatural beliefs; he recommends that Mortimer simply meet Sir Henry at Waterloo Station upon his arrival, yet not tell him anything of the current situation. Mortimer departs, as does Watson, who knows that his friend needs isolation in which to reflect upon the facts of the case. When Watson returns several hours later, he finds Holmes poring over a topographical map of the Baskerville estate and the surrounding lands. Holmes has also concluded that, contrary to Sir Charles’ usual routine, the squire of Baskerville Hall was waiting at the wicket-gate; and that the shifting shape of Sir Charles’ footprints as reported by Mortimer must be due to the fact that Sir Charles began running away from something in terror.
Analysis: Conan Doyle created one of the most famous rationalists in world literature, yet he himself remained very open to “supernatural explanation[s]” of worldly phenomena (p. 38). The author was a committed Spiritualist (including his adherence to the belief that the dead could communicate with the living), and is also remembered as one of the more famous defenders of the “Cottingley fairies,” a 1917 incident in which two young girls purported to have taken photographs of fairies in their garden (later proved to be cardboard cutouts). Sherlock Holmes would never for a moment have been taken in by such a ruse, as this chapter makes plain. “We are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses,” he tells Watson, “before falling back upon” supernatural ones (p. 38). Although Holmes demonstrates some respect for Mortimer—when the physician notes the two separate droppings of ash from Sir Charles’ cigar, Holmes proclaims him to be “a colleague, Watson, after our own heart” (p. 33)—he clearly rejects Mortimer’s eager embrace of the paranormal and the otherworldly. As Holmes correctly points out, such an attitude does not quite seem to befit “a trained man of science” (p. 34). Holmes points out inconsistencies in supernaturalism’s own internal logic: for example, he seeks to disarm Mortimer’s fear for Sir Henry’s fate were the scion of the family to return to the state by pointing out that “surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire” (p. 35). And whereas Mortimer gives easy credence to reports of “several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature” (p. 33), Holmes makes it his life’s work to achieve such reconciliations. In maxim-like fashion, Holmes declares to Watson (who is very often the recipient of such lessons in the Holmes stories), “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes” (p. 37). Observation and logic, not a resort to supernatural hypotheses, prove critical to Holmes’ success.
The detective concerns himself with the real world: “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?” he asks (p. 38). As one who has apprehended many criminals prior to this case, Holmes knows the answer must be affirmative!
Chapter 4: Sir Henry Baskerville
Summary: At ten the next morning, Mortimer arrives at Baker Street with Sir Henry Baskerville, who has already experienced a singular occurrence. Although no one should have known that he had stayed the night at the Northumberland Hotel, he received a letter addressed to him there: a single sheet of paper containing a message composed of words—all but the last one—clipped from a printed source and affixed to the sheet: “As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.” To everyone’s astonishment, Holmes immediately identifies the source of the clippings as the lead article from the previous day’s Times. (The word “moor” had to be supplied by hand in ink because it is a less common word.) Holmes further deduces (from the ink splotches, indicative, he says, of a hotel fountain pen) that the sender of the letter assembled it in a hotel near Charing Cross (from the envelope’s postmark). Whether the letter is warning or threat, no one seems sure. Sir Henry is still unaware of the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death; Mortimer gives him the same account he gave Holmes and Watson the previous day. Sir Henry reports that he bought a new pair of boots upon his arrival in London, and, never having worn them, left them outside his hotel room in order to be varnished overnight. That morning, he discovered one of the boots, and one only, had been stolen. Mortimer and Sir Henry begin walking back to the hotel; allowing them a lead of two hundred yards, Holmes and Watson follow them, unbeknownst to the baronet and the physician. Holmes spies a bearded man in a hansom cab also shadowing the pair; unfortunately, the bearded man notices Holmes and Watson in return, and urges his driver to move quickly on, so that Holmes and Watson cannot catch up. They lose the trail of the hansom cab; they lose track of Mortimer and Sir Henry; but Holmes did note the number of the cab (No. 2704). He plans to send a telegram to ascertain the identity of the driver of that cab; meanwhile, he hires a teenager named Cartwright to inspect the garbage from the 23 hotels in the Charing Cross area, looking for a cut-up front page of yesterday’s Times. This evidence, Holmes reasons, will lead them to the person who sent Sir Henry his mysterious letter.
Analysis: As a character, Sir Henry is not yet well-developed in this chapter; however, that is due to the fact that he serves mainly as a way for Conan Doyle to introduce deeper levels of mystery into the tale (the enigmatic letter and the stolen boot). We do, however, read that Sir Henry has “the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air”—indicative, as he says, of having spent most of his life in the United States and Canada (p. 46)—but also “the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman” (p. 41). Sir Henry is both rugged and genteel, civilized and of the frontier. He also intends to continue the good works of his uncle: he intends to fully embrace his role as “squire” (p. 47) of Baskerville Hall. “There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer” (p. 48). This resolve speaks to Sir Henry’s “fiery temper,” a family trait (p. 48). Therefore, although we do not yet know much about him, he emerges from this chapter as a sympathetic character in whose fate readers will be interested.
This chapter also, of course, serves to further dazzle Conan Doyle’s readers with Holmes’ logical prowess. His knowledge of various typefaces (although he allows that, as a younger man, he “confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News,” p. 44—surely a fully self-aware statement of false humility, since most ordinary people would not even begin to know how to distinguish the papers’ typography), his immediate recall of the number of hotels in the Charing Cross area, his identification of the kind of scissors used by the letter’s compositor, his knowledge of the traits of hotel fountain pens—all these instances further establish Holmes (as though he needed any such establishment in the minds of Conan Doyles’ reading audience!) as master of his “special hobby” of detection (p. 44). We also learn, however, that Holmes does not rely solely on his own efforts. His employment of young Cartwright hearkens back to his use of “the Baker Street Irregulars”—a ragamuffin group of street urchins, who perform various tasks and find out information for Holmes for a shilling reward—in the Conan Doyle’s two previous Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four.
Chapter 5: Three Broken Threads
Summary: At the Northumberland Hotel, Holmes and Watson find Sir Henry distraught because an old black boot was returned to him in place of the new brown one that was stolen. At lunch, Sir Henry announces his intention to go to Baskerville Hall at the week’s end, a decision Holmes affirms. When Sir Henry asks Holmes to accompany him, Holmes regrets that he cannot, but suggests that Watson go in his stead. Holmes tells Sir Henry and Mortimer that they were followed yesterday; he learns that Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, has a full, dark beard, as did Sir Henry and Mortimer’s unknown follower. Barrymore and his wife were left £500 each in Sir Charles’ will. Other beneficiaries include £1000 to Mortimer and numerous other individuals and charities. Sir Henry is inheriting £740,000. In all, Sir Charles’ estate is valued “close on to a million.” Holmes learns that, had Sir Henry been unable to inherit the estate, it would have passed to one James Desmond, an elderly clergyman. As the group rises from lunch, Sir Henry spies his missing new brown boot under a cabinet in a corner of the dining room, even though all previous searches had not located it.
Upon returning to Baker Street, Holmes receives telegrams informing him that Barrymore the butler is at Baskerville Hall, and that Cartwright was unable to locate the cut-up front page of the previous day’s Times. Also, he and Watson receive a visit from John Clayton, the driver of hansom cab no. 2704. Clayton tells them that his fare, so interested in trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer, was a detective by the name of Sherlock Holmes! Holmes is amused at having been bested by their unknown opponent, but warns Watson that the case is rapidly developing into “an ugly dangerous business.”
Analysis: The chapter title is metaphorical, of course: when the interview with Clayton fails to yield the name of his fare, Holmes laments, “Snap goes our third thread [of investigation], and we end where we began” (p. 63). (The other two threads were the location of Barrymore—his presence at Baskerville Hall would seem to argue against his being the bearded man who followed Sir Henry and Mortimer—and Cartwright’s failure to find the mutilated newspaper.) Notice, however, how Holmes often takes setbacks in stride. He greets Clayton’s revelation that his fare was “Sherlock Holmes,” for instance, with “a hearty laugh,” proclaiming (using a metaphor from the sport of fencing), “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” (p. 61). (Klinger notes that Holmes is here alluding to Hamlet, Act V, Scene ii: “Is this further evidence of Holmes’ acting career or merely of his knowledge of literature?”, p. 457.) Holmes is secure enough in his own intellectual ability to recognize when others have bested him (a trait we see in other Holmes stories; for example, his respectful appellation of Irene Adler as “The Woman” in “A Scandal in Bohemia”)—even if, in the end, he has every reason to believe he will gain the upper hand (as he does in this case—else he would not have been able to display what Watson describes as that “remarkable” ability of “detaching his mind at will” in order to enjoy the art exhibition prior to the trip to the Northumberland Hotel, p. 53). In fact, Holmes relishes matching wits with opponents who can challenge him; in several Holmes stories, we see that he cares little for common, unimaginative criminals. No: Holmes is far happier, far more intellectually stimulated, when he is placed in a contest with, as he says here, “a foeman who is worthy of our steel” (p. 63—and one almost senses that the use of the plural pronoun refers not to himself and Watson, but the “royal we”!)
For all that it reinforces Holmes’ high opinion of himself, however, this chapter also shows us the true friendship and regard in which he holds his confidante and chronicler, Dr. Watson. When he suggests that Sir Henry take “a trusted man” with him to Baskerville Hall (albeit after begging off being that man himself because of a highly important and delicate case in which he is already involved—an explanation of which readers should make a mental note), he commends Watson to Sir Henry: “there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say that more confidently than I” (p. 58). The detective may not always acknowledge it openly, but he knows Watson is much more than (as he said in Chapter 1) “a conductor of [Holmes’ own] light.” The good doctor is a man of practical common sense and also capable of direct action; as Watson himself says, “The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me…” (p. 59). The recommendation that Watson accompany Sir Henry also marks a transition to the next portion of the narrative, in which Watson will be much more directly involved in the action.
 
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
860,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 6 - 10," 
Summary: Holmes urges Watson to report any even possibly relevant fact about the situation at the Baskerville estate back to him. After eliminating the elderly clergyman Desmond, Holmes enumerates those who live at and around Baskerville Hall whom he does consider suspects in Sir Charles’ death: the Barrymores, Dr. Mortimer and his wife, the naturalist Stapleton and his sister, Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and a few other neighbors.” Watson takes a revolver with him. At the platform, Mortimer avers that he and Sir Henry have not been followed again. He says he and the baronet remained together during the previous two days, save for the time Mortimer spent at the Museum of the College of Surgeons and Sir Henry spent in a park (probably Hyde Park, according to Klinger, 462). Sir Henry reports that he never got his other boot back. Holmes urges Sir Henry not to travel the moors alone or at night. The train arrives in Devonshire after only a few hours’ time, and Sir Henry is quite moved by the impressive and imposing sight of Baskerville Hall and its lands, which he has never visited. The company learns that a convict has escaped from the nearby prison at Princetown; armed soldiers keep watch, but the fugitive—the notorious (and possibly insane) Notting Hill murderer, named Selden—has not yet been spotted. Barrymore the butler greets Sir Henry and the others at the Hall, but does announce that he and his wife plan to leave once the Hall’s new master is settled; he says they were greatly devoted to Sir Charles, and cannot stay on comfortably as a result of his death. As Watson tries to sleep that night, he hears the muffled sobbing of a sorrowful woman.
Analysis: This chapter largely serves an atmospheric purpose, further establishing the ominous tone and sense of foreboding that hang over Baskerville Hall and its ill-fated residents as we see the familial estate for the first time, through the eyes of our narrator, Dr. Watson. “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” says Sir Henry, in a masterful understatement (p. 72). Indeed, Baskerville Hall and its environs seem to be, in the topography of Conan Doyle’s novel, the one blemish on an otherwise pleasant stretch of the British countryside. “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his own country,” remarks Watson (p. 66)—but surely very few, and certainly none who did not hail from the Baskerville line, would swear by this estate! We see it first in “fading light” (p. 70)—a symbolic description, also, of the faded glory of the Baskerville line. Watson’s description of the Hall and its setting—evocative of similar literary houses in decay such as Poe’s House of Usher—not only sets a tone of dread and danger, therefore, but also establishes Baskerville Hall as a liminal location—a “thin place” (as ancient Celts termed them), in “limbo” between two worlds or two realities.
In fantasy, the presence of liminal beings in liminal locations often serves to signal that a protagonist will learn a lesson that could not be taught otherwise. In his book How to Read Literature Like a Professor (Quill, 2003), Thomas C. Foster argues that every trip in a work of fiction is really a quest, and that “the real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge” (Foster, p. 3). It is not immediately clear that such is the case in Conan Doyle’s novel, although the hypothesis is not without merit. One might argue, perhaps, that Sir Henry is in a sense “coming of age” as he comes into his own as squire of Baskerville Hall (e.g., “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had never seen the Hall,” p. 66), and is thus recapitulating in some small sense “the hero’s quest.” Watson certainly provides a heroic description of the baronet in this chapter: “as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men” (p. 67; see also his comment in the next chapter that it is Sir Henry’s way to live in “the place of danger,” p. 86). And the good doctor himself might be considered a potential candidate for liminal instruction, although Conan Doyle’s intent with the character seems to have been never much more than to provide an accessible narrator with whom readers could identify as, together, narrator and audience marvel at the deductive prowess of Sherlock Holmes! (It is no small testament to Conan Doyle’s skill, therefore, that The Hound of the Baskervilles—“another adventure of Sherlock Holmes” in which Holmes himself is absent for such a long stretch of the narrative—continually ranks among readers’ favorites in the Sherlockian “canon.”)
 
Thomas Foster also rhetorically asks, “What… does geography mean to a work of literature? Would everything be too much?... Geography in literature can… be revelatory of virtually any element in the work” (Foster, p. 164, 166). This thesis holds true for The Hound of the Baskervilles. The physical setting of Baskerville Hall does more than establish a mood or tone; it also establishes thematic material. Readers can clearly see this dynamic at work as Watson writes of Selden, the escaped murderer who is believed to be running loose among the moors: “Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out” (p. 68). To judge from Watson’s words, Selden sounds the equal of such famous, outcast literary monsters as Grendel and Frankenstein’s Creature!
There may yet be hope for the Baskerville house, both the estate and the lineage: Facing the black and forbidding manor house “is a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s South African gold” (p. 69). The half-completed new building reperesents all the good that Sir Charles was doing with his wealth, and the good works that Sir Henry has announced his intention to continue. The new and the old are almost in conflict at Baskerville Hall—e.g., the “twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes” are athwart “more modern wings of black granite” (p. 70); or the contrast between the old dining hall, complete with portraits of a “dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency” and the “modern billiard-room” (p. 72)—all further evidence of the place’s liminal nature. When Sir Henry sees the house, despite the solemn atmosphere, “his dark face [lights] up with a boyish enthusiasm” as he contemplates plans for its improvement (p. 71). (Note how he proposes to bring electricity—British inventor Joseph Swan received a patent for a lightbulb in 1878, a year before Thomas Alva Edison received his patent in America—to the hall “inside of six months,” p. 69—his role, both literally and figuratively, is that of a bringer of light into darkness.) The fact that all is not lost for the Baskervilles lends a sense of urgency to the solution of the mystery. Much is at stake, not only for Sir Henry, but for the disordered, chaotic society around him.
Chapter 7: The Stapletons of Merripit House
Summary: In the morning, Watson learns that the weeping woman he heard the previous night was Mrs. Barrymore, even though her husband denied the fact. He also learns that the telegram Holmes sent from London to Mr. Barrymore was not delivered directly into the butler’s hands, meaning that Barrymore could have been in the city, after all, trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer. While Sir Henry sorts through necessary paperwork, Watson goes walking upon the moor, where he meets the naturalist Jack Stapleton, who lives nearby at Merripit House in the hamlet of Grimpen. His house is an old residence now refurbished for modern living. Mortimer is hunting butterflies, and tells Watson several curious details about the moor, including the fact that the apparently lush and fertile mire around Grimpen is actually a treacherous place, where one “false step… means death to man or beast.” Indeed, the two men watch a pony sucked down into the mire as it attempts to gallop through. The mire has encroached upon the hills over the years, essentially transforming them into highly inaccessible islands; Mortimer, however, goes to the islands to seek his rare specimens. As he is pursuing an especially unusual butterfly, his sister, Beryl Stapleton, approaches Watson and, thinking the doctor is Sir Henry, urges him to return to London as soon as possible. Jack returns and introduces the two; later, Beryl meets Watson on the road back to Baskerville Hall, asking him to forget her warning, which Watson is understandably loathe to do. Beryl tells Watson that she believes in the curse of the Hound, and cannot understand why Sir Henry wishes to place himself in danger. Watson cannot ascertain from Beryl why she could not tell him this in her brother’s hearing; she refuses to elaborate, and returns to Merripit House quickly, before she can be missed.
Analysis: Conan Doyle introduces two new characters in this chapter, Jack and Beryl Stapleton. Mentioned earlier (see Ch. 2, p. 29), Jack Stapleton is a naturalist, as were many well-educated men of means in the Victorian era: not a formally trained scientist as we understand that distinction today, but one well versed in such natural sciences as botany and zoology. Jack was formerly a teacher, but a “serious epidemic” claimed the lives of three boys in his school, causing it to close and “irretrievably swallow[ing] up” much of Jack’s investment in the institution (p. 84). He relates this history in a remarkably casual way; Conan Doyle may be attempting to plant a seed of doubt in readers’ minds, as any good mystery writer does. Part of the author’s task is to cast the gloom of suspicion upon as many characters as possible, heightening suspense and keeping readers guessing about the solution of the mystery. (Note also how, in this chapter, the butler Barrymore engages in suspicious behavior, denying that his wife was crying the night before, even though Watson sees for himself that she was. This fact causes Watson to reflect upon Barrymore’s reliability: “It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man’s death,” p. 75).
Jack Stapleton makes repeated references to the unusual nature of the location of Baskerville Hall. He expresses surprise that Sir Henry would “bury himself in a place of this kind” (p. 77)—a striking choice of language, given that Sir Charles has only recently been literally buried! He calls the moor a “queer” and “uncanny place altogether” (p. 81), and states—in a knowing way, which may also raise readers’ suspicions—that Watson “will find some very singular points” about it (p. 82). Yet Jack also seems to enjoy the locale in a way that his sister clearly does not. Even though the moor is “hard to know” (p. 79), Jack knows his way to and from the islands in “the great Grimpen Mire… a bad place” (p. 80). He actively dissuades Watson (who, in several of the Sherlock Holmes stories, establishes himself also as active and witty) from seeking to reach the islands himself—perhaps another point of suspicion? Why does Jack spend so much time upon the moor—solely to add to his impressive butterfly collection?  And why does he react so casually to the drowning of the pony in the mire? As Watson points out, the sight of the horse’s death “turned [him] cold with horror, but [Jack’s] nerves seemed to be stronger” (p. 80). Jack’s reaction to the dead pony is not, in fact, unlike his reaction to his three dead students: author Frederick Ryan-Brown questions how Jack could possibly have felt “simultaneously… uninterested and privileged, and suggests that, based on how the reader eventually comes to understand the character, Stapleton’s first thought is far truer than the second” (Klinger, 485). Certainly, readers may conclude there is more to Jack than meets the eye—as, indeed, is the case with the moor itself. We learn in this chapter that the moor and the Grimpen mire are places where appearances can be deceiving. The mire, for instance, looks to Watson like “a rare place for a gallop” (p. 79), but it is actually treacherous ground. What appear to be “sheep-pens” (p. 81) are actually the huts of Neolithic ancestors (another example of the moor’s liminality, “mired,” as it were, in between the past and the present; according to Klinger, “Baedeker’s Great Britain (1894) characterizes the moors as abounding in menhirs, stone circles, and ‘other relics of the ancient Brtions,” p. 482).
 
Altogether, the chapter compounds the mystery surrounding Baskerville Hall. Readers may feel as disoriented as Watson: “Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track” (p. 86). To his credit, however, Watson does not shrink from the mystery in the way that Sir Henry seems to. By the light of the morning, the baronet is able to dismiss his misgivings about Baskerville Hall as the effect of being “tired with [the] journey and chilled by [the] drive,” and he dismisses the sound of Mrs. Barrymore’s weeping as a dream; Watson, in contrast, steadfastly maintains, “I heard it distinctly” (p. 74). The good doctor may be confused at the moment, but readers nevertheless have reason to believe that Sherlock Holmes’ confidence in him as his proxy has been well-placed.
Chapter 8: First Report of Dr. Watson
Summary: Watson writes a letter to Holmes, reporting that Selden, the escaped convict, is believed to have left the area entirely. He also reports that Sir Henry has begun to express an attraction to Miss Beryl Stapleton—a development that appears to cause her brother, Jack, some consternation. Watson has also now seen the yew alley, the scene of Sir Charles’ death, for himself; and has met Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall, an elderly man who spends most of his time filing lawsuits and surveying the moor with a telescope. Sir Henry has asked Barrymore about Holmes’ test telegram from London: Barrymore confirms that the message was not delivered into his hands; he claims his wife—whom Watson thinks aloof and puritanical—brought it to him and relayed his answer. Watson concludes his letter by reporting that, around two o’clock that morning, he saw Barrymore walking stealthily through the corridors and peering out the window onto the moor, impatiently.
Analysis: This chapter is presented as a letter from Watson to Holmes. There is some irony in the fact that much of Watson’s letter is concerned with matters of the heart, as he tells Holmes of Sir Henry’s “considerable interest in our fair neighbour,” Miss Stapleton (p. 90). Readers may wonder whether Holmes would have observed this development as keenly as Watson does: the good doctor notes, “From the first moment that [Sir Henry] saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual” (p. 91). Watson is also able to discern Jack Stapleton’s disapproval of the baronet’s romantic attentions to his sister, as well as to surmise an explanation: “He is much attached to her… and would lead a lonely life without her” (p. 91). Although readers cannot know whether Holmes would or would not have ascertained these affairs of the heart for himself, they can have no doubt that, know that he knows of them, he will take them into consideration. Holmes’ confidence in sending Watson to Baskerville Hall in his stead is thus further justified. The doctor is developing his own “theories” about the “secret business going on in this house of gloom” (pp. 96, 95); and, indeed, has devised a plan of action in cooperation with Sir Henry to test them; but he, as well as the readers, know that the ultimate solution must await Holmes’ arrival.
Only briefly introduced in this chapter, Frankland nevertheless makes a striking impression, thanks to Watson’s economical but well-chosen words of description: “he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting” (p. 92). How true such motivation seems to be behind so much litigious action, not only in Victorian Britain but also in modern America! Frankland is in Watson’s view a comic character, for his continued engagement in lawsuits seems a reckless waste of his fortune and results in equal amounts praise and disapprobation for him: Frankland “applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit” (p. 93). (According to Klinger, “there was no village of Fernworthy, [but] there was a substantial farming district of that name” in Dartmoor, p. 494.) Readers may also infer that Frankland will prove important for his ongoing observation of the moor, looking for the escaped convict Selden—Watson’s theory that the criminal must be far away, due to lack of food on the moor, seems overly optimistic (and Conan Doyle would not be making so much of the fact were it not to figure into the story at some future point, in some way). Readers will also note that Frankland is one of two people we see watching the moor: the other, of course, is Barrymore, whom Watson secretly spies “crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass… as he stared out into the blackness of the moor… watching intently” (p. 95). It is a suitably Gothic image for this tale of suspense and suggested supernatural mystery—as well as, of course, a potential clue in its ultimate resolution.
Chapter 9: Second Report of Dr. Watson: The Light upon the Moor
Summary: Watson and Sir Henry plan to follow Barrymore on his nocturnal walk that evening, in order to discovery why he stands at the particular window he does, the window “which commands the nearest outlook upon the moor.” In the meantime, Sir Henry asks Watson to leave him alone as he goes down to the moor to visit Miss Stapleton. Watson, torn between his desire to respect his new friend’s privacy and his promise to Holmes to not leave the baronet alone, follows from a distance. Thus he sees Sir Henry and Beryl Stapleton’s animated conversation (which he cannot hear) interrupted by Jack Stapleton, brandishing his butterfly net. After more apparently heated conversation, brother and sister leave Sir Henry. Watson reveals himself to the baronet, who tells him that he was in the midst of proposing marriage to Miss Stapleton. Her brother objected, expressing anger with both his sister and Sir Henry. The baronet cannot understand why Beryl’s brother should possibly object to the match. That afternoon, however, Jack Stapleton visits the Hall, explaining that he is simply upset at the thought of losing his sister to marriage after so many years of togetherness. He asks Sir Henry to wait three months before pursuing any more talk of marriage, in order to give him time to acclimate to the idea. Sir Henry agrees.
For the next two nights, he and Watson carry out their plan of tracking Barrymore to the window. On the first night, they hear no sound of the butler; on the second, however, they do follow him to the window. They watch as Barrymore holds a candle to it, and see a corresponding, answering light on the moor. When they confront Barrymore, they learn from him and his wife that Eliza Barrymore’s younger brother is none other than the escaped convict, Selden. They had taken him in and cared for him prior to Sir Henry’s arrival at Baskerville Hall; once Sir Henry returned, they arranged to signal him privately, every other night, to see if he needed food and provisions. If he answered their signal, they would set out goods for him. Watson and Sir Henry resolve to capture Selden and turn him in to the authorities. When they reach the light on the moor, however—it is a candle so set in the cleft of a tor (an outcropping of rock formed by weathering, usually located at or near a hill’s summit) that it can only be seen on a direct line-of-sight from the window at which Barrymore stood—they are not able to catch Selden, although they see (presumably) the criminal’s “evil yellow face… all seamed and scored with vile passions.” Selden outruns the two men. They hear a terrible crying sound, the sound Watson has heard once previously and which residents of the moor believe to be the baying of the Baskerville Hound; furthermore, Watson alone catches a glimpse of a man atop the tor a taller man than Selden, standing silent and still. Before Watson can point this mysterious figure out to Sir Henry, the stranger is gone. Watson again writes to Holmes, relating all these events to him and urging him to come quickly to Baskerville Hall.
Analysis: As he concludes his second epistle to Holmes, Watson confidently asserts, “We are certainly making some progress” (p. 115). Certainly, several mysteries at Baskerville Hall seem to have been explained. But readers of the detective genre in general and of Sherlock Holmes stories in particular may well intuit that Watson’s confidence in his own investigative abilities may yet prove premature. The good doctor asks Holmes to “congratulate” him, “and tell me that I have not disappointed you as agent” (p. 105). And Holmes may not “regret” sending Watson (p. 105)—yet Watson may discover, as he did in the first chapter, that Holmes values Watson for reasons other than those Watson would presume! It is unlikely, for example, that the detective will be content with Jack Stapleton’s explanation of his behavior toward Sir Henry and his sister, even though Watson and Sir Henry accept this explanation straightaway. Even so, Watson’s work will prove valuable in providing Holmes with “all the facts”—as the doctor himself realizes: he “feel[s] that it is best” that Holmes “select for [him]self those [facts] which will be of most service” (p. 115). Sir Henry’s question regarding his and Watson’s outing in pursuit of Selden—“I say, Watson… what would Holmes say to this?” (p. 111)—in some respect applies to Watson’s entire account of the matter. What would Holmes say? Readers can expect that he will see the same facts as Watson, as well as many others, and yet arrive at different and more fully correct conclusions.
Jack Stapleton’s account of his emotional state, as well as his request that Sir Henry wait three months before officially courting Beryl, rings a bit hollow (not least because, sad to say, it is an explanation Watson had already constructed as a possibility, in his first letter to Holmes-cf. p. 91). More convincing—again, in no small part because it comes as a surprise, and since they have no obvious incentive to manufacture such a tale—is the Barrymores’ revelation that Eliza is Selden’s sister. Conan Doyle has thus established two unusual brother-sister relationships in the novel: Jack and Beryl Stapleton, and John and Eliza Barrymore. These relationships, each one conflicted in some way—Jack’s displeasure at Sir Henry’s attentions to Beryl; the strain John and Eliza bear and the risk they run in supporting their brother who “dragged [their family] name in the dirt” (p. 109)—reinforce the novel’s preoccupation with the influence of family and the inescapable power of lineage, which is, after all, what Sir Henry is reckoning with, as well. The baronet, Watson reports, is sparing no expense to refurbish the Hall and thus “restore the grandeur of his family” (p. 99). Restoring family fortunes—both literal and metaphorical—are emerging as one of the novel’s major thematic concerns.
Regarding Selden’s physical appearance as described by Watson, Klinger notes, “Watson seems… to embrace the popular conception… that criminals could be identified by certain physical characteristics” (p. 515). The irony is that this prevailing medical-physiological theory of the day is no more sound than Mortimer’s devotion to phrenology—or, indeed, than the commoners’ superstitious belief in the Baskervilles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
 
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
 
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.
",The Hound of the Baskervilles
861,The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 11 - 15," 
Summary: Watson questions Laura Lyons, who reluctantly tells him that she wrote to Sir Charles on the day of his death. Persecuted by her husband and her father (Frankland), she was seeking further assistance toward her financial independence (she has also been receiving help from Stapleton). Mrs. Lyons insists, however, that she never went to Baskerville Hall that day; she claims to have received help from elsewhere, and planned to commence divorce proceedings against her husband, a claim Watson intends to verify—although he must admit to himself that her story hangs together. He still intuits, however, that she may be hiding some truth from him. The doctor then turns his attention to seeking the man he saw on the Black Tor; he receives unexpected help from Frankland, who claims to have seen the messenger boy who takes Selden his food. Watson knows the truth: the boy is supplying food to the unknown man upon the moor, and not to Selden (who has been supplied by the Barrymores). Frankland shows Watson the boy through his telescope, as he is delivering one of his bundles. Watson goes to the same old stone hut as the boy. It is empty at the moment but shows signs of being recently inhabited, chief among them a surprising note: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.” Watson fears that this stranger is pursuing him rather than Sir Henry until the hut’s inhabitant returns, revealing himself to be none other than Sherlock Holmes.
Analysis: Poor Dr. Watson—his efforts are admirable, but he will never be able to outshine Holmes! Which is, of course, only as it should be: having Watson as an affable foil to the often abrasive but indisputably brilliant Holmes is the chief way in which Conan Doyle characterizes his most famous character. We see Holmes through Watson’s admiring eyes, and thus come to admire him ourselves. Thus we can forgive the master detective his dramatic entrance, in which he has some fun at Watson’s expense. Holmes’ arrival even has a slight air of justice about it, for Watson has earlier speculated, “It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run [the man on the tor] to earth where my master had failed” (p. 132). Were Watson to best Holmes, things would be even more out of joint than they already are! Conan Doyle’s use of “master” language may seem odd, smacking as it does of Victorian British class structure; it implies that Holmes and Watson are not equals. While they are equal in a socio-economic sense (they do, after all, share the flat at Baker Street), they are not equal in their deductive ability. And so we also likely feel some of Watson’s relief that Holmes has, at last, arrived—for Watson has been effectively stymied in his own detecting work: “Once again,” he laments after his interview with Laura Lyons, “I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission” (p. 131). For all these reasons, then, readers may fairly anticipate that Holmes’ arrival on the scene marks the beginning of a “re-ordering” of the disordered social world of the novel.
The marital status of Laura Lyons reflects some of the social disorder with which Victorian society was grappling. As Klinger points out, “Victorian society had little regard for divorced (or separated) women” (p. 538), and so both Watson’s and the reader’s sympathies for Laura Lyons are to be assumed as she faces the predicament of dealing with an abusive father on the one hand and an abusive husband on the other. Nonetheless, Mortimer has previously stated that he does not believe Mrs. Lyons to be completely blameless, and so some prejudice toward her has already been injected into the narrative. Certainly, Watson’s suspicions about her are not completely allayed after his interview with her. In the original manuscript of this chapter (Chapter 11 is the only portion of the work, aside from single pages, still known to exist in manuscript form), Watson’s suspicions are voiced somewhat more strongly: “Either she was an accomplished actor and a deep conspirator, or Barrymore had misread the letter, or the letter was a forgery…” (p. 539). As the text stands, however, we are left with Watson’s grudging conclusion that Mrs. Lyons’ “story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it” (p. 131). (For his own part, Conan Doyle proved an advocate of divorce law reformation, seeking to improve the ease with which women could be granted a divorce, not just a separation.)
Chapter 12: Death on the Moor
Summary: Once Watson has recovered from the shock of the detective’s self-revelation, Holmes explains that he has not, in fact, been occupied with a blackmail case in London; he has been secretly investigating the Baskerville case on his own. (The boy who has been supplying him is Cartwright, from the telegraph office in London.) Watson tells Holmes about his interview with Laura Lyons; Holmes informs Watson that the woman is intimate with Jack Stapleton, and that Beryl Stapleton is, in fact, Jack’s wife and not his sister. Holmes did not know that Lyons was planning to divorce her husband; he surmises that she planned on marring Stapleton, whom she did not know was already married. Holmes has also concluded that Jack was their mysterious, bearded pursuer in the city, and that Beryl sent Sir Henry the cut-and-paste letter of warning. Holmes and Watson hear a terrible scream; they discover a corpse with an expression of terror on its face whom they initially believe to be Sir Henry, based on its clothing, broken upon a rocky ridge. Upon closer examination, however, they discover that the dead man is Selden. Watson recalls how the Barrymores had given Sir Henry’s old clothes to Selden as part of their support for the fugitive. Holmes deduces that the hound—a real hound, not the Hound of legend—must have been trained to track Sir Henry based upon an item of his clothing (likely the boot stolen from Sir Henry at the hotel in London). Jack Stapleton approaches Holmes and Watson and expresses shock at Selden’ death. He claims to have been concerned for Sir Henry because he had invited the baronet to come to the Stapletons’ home that night, and he never arrived; when he heard the screams, he says, he grew worried.
Analysis: This chapter provides some additional insights into Holmes’ characters, showing us as it does the detective’s obvious enjoyment of having befuddled Watson with his unexpected appearance. Watson describes Holmes’ voice as “cold, incisive, [and] ironical” (p. 139), adjectives that could as easily describe the man himself as well as his manner of speaking! And yet perhaps not entirely cold: although surely Holmes is pleased with himself at having surprised the good doctor, he is also concerned (albeit to a lesser extent) with his colleague’s feelings. When Watson complains that he thinks he should “have deserved better [treatment] at [Holmes’] hands,” Holmes assures Watson that his “zeal and intelligence” while on his own have “been invaluable” (p. 141). Knowing that Watson is “rather raw over the deception” (p. 141), Holmes praises him—not, it seems, insincerely—and seems genuinely pleased to see “the shadow rise from [Watson’s] face” as a result (p. 142). Thus, while Holmes does remain primarily concerned with his own methods and the mystery at hand, readers see that he is not completely without human feeling and sensitivities. They are simply not his normal modus operandi! As he tells Stapleton at the chapter’s end, “[a]n investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours” (p. 150)—nor, it seems, undue emotional material, except insofar as it may explain the motives of those involved in a case. (For example, he does understand that Laura Lyons may be more forthcoming when she “is undeceived” of the notion that Beryl Stapleton is Jack’s sister, p. 144). The chapter also shows us that Holmes is not infallible (merely nearly so!). He makes the same mistake Watson does when finding the body upon the moor: he initially identifies it as Sir Henry simply because the corpse wears the baronet’s clothing. Nor is Holmes completely unflappable: when he and Watson hear Selden’s dying screams, Watson notes that Holmes, “the man of iron, was shaken to the soul” (p. 145).
Chapter 13: Fixing the Nets
Summary: Holmes instructs Watson to keep all knowledge of the hound that tracked Selden a secret from Sir Henry, in order that the baronet may be better prepared to face dinner with the Stapletons the next evening. Holmes has a plan that hinges upon Sir Henry’s attendance. At Baskerville Hall, Watson tells the Barrymores of Selden’s death; the husband seems relieved, but his wife, Selden’s sister, weeps with grief. While speaking with Sir Henry, Holmes takes notice of the portraits of his ancestors, including a portrait of Hugo Baskerville, who seems, to Holmes’ eyes, “a quiet, meek-mannered man enough,” and not the reprobate of legend whose exploits supposedly brought the curse of the Hound upon his line. When Sir Henry leaves, Holmes points out to Watson how much Stapleton resembles Hugo. Holmes concludes that Stapleton must be, in fact, a member of the Baskerville family, scheming to take Sir Henry’s inheritance. The next morning, Holmes announces that he and Watson will be returning to London prior to the dinner engagement with the Stapletons. Holmes insists that Sir Henry relay the message to the Stapletons that he and Watson hope to return soon, and also to drive to Merripit House but then announce his intention to walk home across the moor, alone, after dinner. Sir Henry does not understand why Holmes is reversing his previous counsel, but agrees to do so. Later, in Coombe Tracey, Holmes instructs young Cartwright to send a telegram in Holmes’ name to Sir Henry, requesting the baronet return a dropped pocketbook by registered mail to Baker Street. When Cartwright returns from the telegram office, he brings a wire from Inspector Lestrade for Holmes, indicating that the police officer is on his way with an unsigned warrant. Holmes and Watson visit Laura Lyons, telling her the truth about Stapleton and learning from her that Jack Stapleton’s dictated the letter she sent to Sir Charles, but also telling her not to keep the appointment with him (protesting that he alone wanted to give her financial assistance, that they might be married).
Analysis: This chapter’s events and revelations contribute to readers’ sense that we are approaching the dénouement, chief among them the fact that Stapleton is, in fact, a Baskerville. This identity supplies him with a motive for mischief and murder, as Watson realizes: “designs upon the succession” to Baskerville Hall (p. 156). Laura Lyons’ information, too, clarifies matters: Stapleton was arranging a way to lure Sir Charles to a secret meeting, a meeting at which he could take action against him. As Holmes says, “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us” (p. 162). His confidence, indeed, borders on hubris, as befits his character: “I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times” (p. 162). It only borders on that overweening pride, however, because, of course, Holmes will be proven correct (in fact, within the narrative’s world, the very existence of the story bears out his judgment—else Watson would not be reporting it!). This lesson is one that Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard has long since taken to heart. Lestrade is a recurring chacter in Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes “canon.” At his initial meeting with Holmes (in the very first story, A Study in Scarlet), he did indeed express “scorn” at Holmes’ theories; now, however, he has “learned a good deal” and is “reverential” toward the detective, eager to assist him (p. 162).
One notable passage in this chapter preserves the humanity of Selden, the dead criminal, as his sister, Mrs. Barrymore, grieves for him: “To all the world”—and, indeed, to Watson, when he spotted the escaped convict on the moor—Selden “was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little willful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him” (p. 153). Watson’s words are a touching reminder of the common humanity uniting all people. (Another reminder may be seen in Holmes’ laughter, ominous though it is for such criminals! Watson remarks that Holmes’ laughter is rare, and, indeed, it seems to be so.

Chapter 14: The Hound of the Baskervilles
Summary: Holmes, Watson and Lestrade return to Dartmoor and walk through a fog-covered night upon the moors to Merripit House, where a concealed Watson observes Sir Henry and Jack Stapleton alone, conversing over cigars, coffee and wine after their dinner. Watson watches as Stapleton leaves the room and goes to an out-house which he enters and from which Watson hears “a curious scuffling noise.” He rejoins Sir Henry, and Watson reports what he has seen to the detective and the police inspector. The three wait, in suspense, for Sir Henry to begin his way back to Baskerville Hall. When he finally does so, they see a terrifying hound, apparently glowing with unearthly fire, chasing the baronet. Holmes and Watson fire revolvers at the beast, but not before it attacks Sir Henry, going for his throat. Empting his gun’s chamber into the hound, Holmes kills it before it can kill Sir Henry. The animal is a bred combination of bloodhound and mastiff, its mouth and eyes having been made up with phosphorous. Upon entering Merripit House, the men find Mrs. Stapleton bound and gagged; when they free her, she tells them that Jack has fled to a tin mine on an island in the middle of Grimpen Mire. The dense, rolling fog prevents Holmes and his party from giving chase. The next morning, they discover Sir Henry’s missing boot—which Stapleton used to put the hound on the baronet’s scent and then flung away as he fled, having heard Holmes’ and Watson’s pistol shots—and traces of Stapleton’s presence in the tin mine where he housed the ferocious animal, but no sign of Stapleton himself. He is presumed to have sunk deep into the miry bog.
Analysis: The penultimate chapter of Conan Doyle’s novel is a classic of suspense. As previously, the author here again uses his story’s setting for its fullest effect, creating an appropriately tense atmosphere: The fog “was drifting slowly in our direction… [Holmes] muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift” (p. 165); “So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it… that dense white sea, with the moon silvering on its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on” (p. 166). Further tension is created by Sir Henry’s delay at leaving Merripit House: “the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind” (p. 165). Both elements create the sense that time is standing still, and this narrative delay increases the suspense to the fullest possible degree before it is resolved. Additionally, this chapter is remembered for its remarkable revelation of the hound: “A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen” (p. 167). Watson’s initial descriptions of the beast—“Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame” (p. 167)—create a kind of cognitive dissonance in the first-time reader: could this actually be the supernatural monster long feared by the Baskervilles and their neighbors on the moor? No; we soon learn that the animal has been bred for size and ferocity, and made-up with a “cunning preparation” of phosphorous material (p. 168). Nevertheless, for the moment in which the hound attacks Sir Henry, readers will have to concede that Watson (thus, of course, Conan Doyle!) has achieved the stated aim of making them “share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner” (p. 171). The novel thus illustrates the literary principle of catharsis: a cleansing, purifying emotional release, intended to refresh the spirit. Indeed, Holmes’ words to Mrs. Stapleton (whom her abusive husband has, in cruel irony, treated no better than one of his butterfly specimens) hint at catharsis—the re-ordering a disordered world, both social and emotional—as one of the book’s concerns (a concern it has in common with much detective fiction): “If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone” (p. 171).  The novel’s social world is now set right. The mystery of the hound has been explained in a rational manner; Sir Henry’s life has been spared (indeed, we learn that after world travel the young baronet becomes again “the hale, hearty man that he had been,” p. 171); and, although Stapleton is not made to stand trial for his crime of murdering Sir Charles and Selden, and attempting to murder Sir Henry, he nonetheless faces a certain poetic justice in meeting his fate on the moor: “Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried” (p. 173). (Of course, as some Holmes enthusiasts have pointed out, it may be “premature to announce Stapleton’s death”—see Klinger, p. 600—as any good mystery fan knows, no one can safely be presumed dead without a corpse!)
Chapter 15: A Retrospection
Summary: Some time later, Watson and Holmes review the facts of the Baskerville case. The detective gives final clarification to several points. Stapleton was the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s brother Rodger, who had fled to South America. After having embezzled public money, Stapleton moved, with his bride Beryl Garcia, to England, where, having changed his name, he established his school (the one true point of his biography that Stapleton had revealed to Watson). Changing his name for the last and final time, he and Beryl moved to Devonshire. Learning that only Sir Charles and Sir Henry stood in the way of his family fortune, he made plans to kill them, using his wife as a decoy and a hidden hound, disguised to look like the Hound of legend, as his weapon. He won the affections of Laura Lyons, whose unkept appointment (at Stapleton’s arranging) with Sir Charles gave Stapleton the chance to unleash the hound upon him. The hound ran on the grass, leaving no tracks behind and thus contributing to the suggestion of a supernatural event. Now turning his attention to Sir Henry, Stapleton took his wife to London with him—not trusting her enough to leave her alone—where he shadowed Mortimer and Sir Henry in his bearded disguise—and where Beryl sent her warning letter to the young baronet, fearing what her husband might do. Stapleton bribed the hotel staff in order to obtain an article of Sir Henry’s clothing, the boot, that the hound could use to track the heir. (While Stapleton was in the city, he left the hound in the care of Anthony, an elderly servant who had been connected with Stapleton for several years, since his stay in South America.) Holmes then conducted his secret surveillance of Stapleton, claiming a non-existent blackmailing case demanded his attention; when ready, he revealed himself to Watson, and the case entered its final phase. When Stapleton learned that Beryl knew of Selden’s death and held him responsible, he beat and bound her so that she would have no chance to warn Sir Henry. Holmes regrets having felt compelled to use Sir Henry as “bait,” but takes comfort in the fact that the baronet will recover in time. The case thus satisfactorily resolved, Holmes and Watson prepare for dinner and an evening at the opera.
Analysis: The novel’s final chapter admirably accomplishes the purpose of detective fiction, mentioned earlier: of putting a disordered society back to order, of restoring ease to a dis-eased world. Much of the information Holmes covers is, of course, already known to careful readers by this point (although there is some new information included, such as the introduction of Stapleton’s servant Anthony, and the speculations about how Stapleton would have claimed Baskerville Hall had his plot succeeded). Nonetheless, logical and aesthetic gratification is to be found in Holmes “kindly giv[ing Watson] a sketch of the course of events” (p. 175). The summary gives the readers a final opportunity to put all the details of the case in order, to distinguish between true clues and false leads (for instance, the litigious character of Frankland emerges as largely irrelevant, save for his role in exacerbating his daughter Laura’s plight), and thus either reassuring themselves that they have successfully matched wits with Holmes (and, by extension, the author), or—more likely Conan Doyle’s intent—having one more chance to marvel at his abilities. Holmes speaks with the barest possible amount of false modesty—e.g., “That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this [trauma] is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,” pp. 181-82; and, in fact, some readers have concurred: “Ian McQueen chides Holmes for not having anticipated the overwhelming possibility of sudden fog, and for taking his oversight lightly,” Klinger, p. 610); but on the whole it is clear that Holmes is satisfied with his investigation—as is evident in the fact that, by the time Watson inquires about it at the chapter’s outset, Holmes has already moved on to more pressing matters: “the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us” (p. 175). And although he indirectly thanks Watson again for his role (particularly the information that Stapleton used to be a headmaster), he stresses, “I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations” (p. 181). It is thus both curious and ironic that the great detective, who so clearly views himself as self-sufficient, should be forever linked in the popular imagination with the man he once called “my Boswell” (“A Study in Scarlet”): readers cannot think of Sherlock Holmes without also thinking of the character through whose writings (ostensibly) we come to know him, Dr. John Watson. The two are an inseparable pair, and thus it is pleasing to see them planning to enjoy a night in London society together as the book draws to its close. That detail, too, reinforces the satisfactory sense of proper resolution to all things, that sense of well-being and order that is one of the enduring appeals of the Sherlock Holmes “canon.” As author and Holmes enthusiast Vincent Starrett wrote in his poem, “221B”:
Here dwell together still two men of note
Who never lived and so can never die:
How very near they seem, yet how remote
That age before the world went all awry.
But still the game’s afoot for those with ears
Attuned to catch the distant view-halloo:
England is England yet, for all our fears–
Only those things the heart believes are true.
A yellow fog swirls past the window-pane
As night descends upon this fabled street:
A lonely hansom splashes through the rain,
The ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet.
Here, though the world explode, these two survive,
And it is always eighteen ninety-five.
elief teѢlles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.
