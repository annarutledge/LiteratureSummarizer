Candide: Summary: Chapters 1-2,"Chapter 1
 Voltaire begins his picaresque tale by introducing the characters who live in the castle of Westphalia, a province in western Germany.  Candide, which means optimism, is the first character introduced, and Voltaire explains that he is the Baron's nephew.  Though Candide has respectable parents, he is a bastard by birth, yet still seems to be a part of the noble palace family.  He is said to be honest, simple-hearted and gentle. 
Other members of the palace include the Baron of Thunder-Ten-Tronckh, the head of the castle, and his overweight wife, the Baroness.  Together, the two have Cunegonde, a gorgeous seventeen-year-old princess, a son, and the esteemed palace tutor, Pangloss, who teaches that everything is for the best and that man lives in the ""best of all possible worlds.""
	It seems Dr. Pangloss is quite versed in ""experimental physics,"" for one day Cunegonde spies the tutor ""giving a lesson"" to her mother's ""attractive and obedient"" maidservant in the bushes.  This inspires Cunegonde to yearn to practice this art with Candide.  When the two young lovers do engage in this kind of science, however, they are caught in the act, and Candide is expelled from the castle permanently.
	 
Chapter 2
 In the second chapter, Candide finds himself ""ejected from the earthly paradise"" to which he had grown accustomed.  Drifting to a neighboring village, and now very cold and hungry, he stumbles across two recruiting officers of Frederick the Great standing outside a tavern.  The two men seem enamored by Candide's height of five feet, five inches, and offer to buy him a meal.  Trusting their kindness, Candide is reminded of Pangloss' philosophy, that all is for the best; he thinks that perhaps being exiled from the castle (and from his love, Cunegonde), may ultimately lead him to a better end after all.
	Soon, however, these newfound ""friends"" bind Candide with chains, and force him into the army, where he is beaten daily.  At one point, Candide is at the point of being killed (smashed in the head, as he requested in order to end his own misery) when the King of the Bulgars passes and grants his pardon.

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 3-4,"Chapter 3
Chapter 3 takes place in the midst of a giant battle between the Bulgars and the Abares.  While writing this, Voltaire was probably considering the Seven Years' War (1756-63), which was fought between the French (Abares) and the Prussians (Bulgars).  Here, Voltaire's anti-war sentiments become obvious.  Casually describing the thousands of dead soldiers on both sides, Voltaire underscores how wasteful these ""heroes"" are of human life. 
Candide, his protagonist, hides, doing his best to keep away from the needless bloodshed and ""heroic butchery."" After the battle subsides, he escapes through the battlefield, seeing the ""scattered brains and severed limbs"" that ""littered the ground."" Soon reaching the country of Holland, where he believes everyone is wealthy and Christian, he expects to be treated very well.  He stumbles across a Protestant preacher of sorts who is lecturing on the topic of charity.  Ironically, when the man sees Candide, he attacks the traveler, telling him that he doesn't deserve any bread.  Voltaire, thus, also indicts religion (particularly radical Protestantism in this chapter), which he believed was often hypocritical. 
	Luckily, a man names Jacques befriends Candide, offering him food and shelter.  Candide is elated that such fortune has found him, and he regains his confidence in Pangloss' philosophy.  All seems to be well again. 
Chapter 4
Soon thereafter, Candide takes a walk through the town when he meets a ""ghastly beggar"" who reveals to his pupil that he is Pangloss.  Candide is shocked and horrified to see his teacher in such a state, but immediately asks about his beloved Cunégonde.  When Pangloss explains that she has been killed, Candide passes out.  Upon awakening, he muses, ""Ah, best of worlds, what's become of you now?"" Obviously, Candide's belief in Pangloss' optimistic philosophy is waning, as Voltaire continues his ruthless indictment of Leibniz, Pope and others.
Pangloss, next, begins to explain the events, including the murder of Cunégonde, that occurred at the castle after Candide had been thrown out.  He says that the beautiful Cunégonde was brutally and repeatedly raped by Bulgar soldiers who attacked the family fortress, finally killing both Cunégonde and the rest of her family before destroying the castle.  Yet it seems the Abares were no less hostile to their enemies, as Pangloss notes their similar treatment of a nearby Bulgar castle.
Hearing this, Candide attempts to understand such seemingly needless suffering by asking his teacher about the ""cause and effect"" and the ""sufficient reason"" for such tragedies, specifically his own sorry state.  Pangloss masterfully crafts a brilliant explanation of his disease, which he explains was sexually transmitted from the servant girl, Paquette, to whom the reader may recall he gave ""physics lessons"" in the opening scene.  The doctor gives a detailed, yet brief account of the STD's path, explaining how it transcended through a Franciscan, and Jesuit, and even through the men of Christopher Columbus himself, who received it from the New World natives.  The devil, however, isn't at the root of such a mess, Pangloss asserts, because such suffering is only a small aspect of a larger good.  For example, if Columbus had never sailed to America, chocolate wouldn't exist to tantalize the taste buds of cultured Europeans.
	Fortunately for Pangloss, Jacques, the ""charitable anabaptist,"" pays to cure the teacher of his disease, though the philosopher loses one eye and one ear in the process.  When Jacques confronts Pangloss' systemic philosophy, however, he responds, "".private misfortunes make for public welfare.""

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 5-6,"Chapter 5
Traveling to Lisbon on a business trip, Jacques brings along his two philosopher friends, Candide and Pangloss.  A terrifying storm ravishes the sea during the boat trip, destroying the vessel and killing all but three of those on board-Candide, Pangloss, and a ""brutal sailor"" who survives at the expense of the kind Christian, Jacques. 
Once ashore, Candide and his mentor see the awful effects of the Lisbon earthquake, a historical natural disaster which killed over 30,000.  With Candide helping many of the surviving victims of the earthquake, Pangloss ""consoles"" the people with his doctrine of universal reason.  When an Inquisition agent asks the wise philosopher if he believes in original sin or free will, Pangloss asserts that both agree with his theory.
Chapter 6
In this chapter, Candide and Pangloss experience the auto-da-fé, a public ceremony intended to avert future disasters through a demonstration of contrition and self-degradation.  This event, like the earthquake which preceded it, actually occurred in Lisbon during the summer of 1756.
	Also connected with Candide's auto-da-fé is the Inquisition, replete with human sacrifices.  Soon Candide and Pangloss find themselves under the category of human sacrifices, having been arrested for the comical charge that one was talking and the other ""listening with an air of approval."" Though Pangloss is hanged (against auto-da-fé custom), Candide, luckily, is only flogged ""in cadence to the music."" This savage pageantry (of Candide being whipped to the beat of a beautiful song) is used by Voltaire to underscore the intolerance and injustice of the Church through its brutal treatment of innocent victims, like Candide, though it maintains the false exquisiteness of tradition.  It's interesting to note that a second earthquake struck the city only a few hours later (Obviously the auto-da-fé was not successful.).
	All this causes Candide to seriously question the optimistic way of thinking, as he seems to be approaching death before an old woman mysteriously appears to aid him.

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 7-8,"Chapter 7
The strange old woman takes Candide to a shanty, where she clothes and feeds him, taking general care of him for a couple of days without the young philosopher even knowing her identity.  Once he has recovered enough to see visitors, the woman leads him to a nearby house where he meets, of all people, Cunégonde. 
His lover is elated to see him, explaining that although she was close to death, she ultimately survived the attacks of the Bulgar soldiers.  Candide also relates his story, which proves quite touching to Cunégonde.
Chapter 8
Chapter 8 is Cunégonde's story-the account of her rape and her family's murder.  Becoming the prisoner-of-war of a certain, ""attractive"" Bulgar captain, she lives in a sort of quasi-bondage for three months, at which time he trades her to a wealthy Jew named Don Issachar.  When the Inquisitor sees Cunégonde at Mass, he immediately threatens the Jew, finally forcing him to agree to turn over his house and Cunégonde, his sex-slave, one-half of the week.  Yet though Cunégonde's servile status is clear, she boasts that she successfully held both of them off.
	Invited to the auto-da-fé as a spectator, Cunégonde soon notices the tutor Pangloss and her lover, Candide.  Seeing the cruelty shown them, she also begins to lose faith in the philosophy of optimism.  Cunégonde quickly instructs her maid, the old woman, to fetch Candide, which she does.
	At the end of the chapter, Don Issachar, the part-time owner of the estate, enters to ""assert his rights and express his tender passion.""

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 9-10,"Chapter 9
Seeing what he believes to be another competitor for Cunégonde's love, the Jew attacks Candide, forcing the pupil of optimism to kill him with a sword.  After Issachar's death, Candide wishes that Pangloss were there to give him advice, but settles for the opinion of the old woman in his stead.  Before she can give her counsel, however, the Grand Inquisitor enters for his nightly visit, forcing Candide to kill him as well.  Quickly the old woman details the plan of their escape-that they will take what gold and diamonds they can lay their hands on, and then they should flee the estate on the backs of three horses. 
When the Holy Brotherhood, an organization with both Church and State powers, enters the household to bury their holy Inquisitor and fling Issachar onto a dunghill, the three fugitives are gone.
	In this chapter, Voltaire obviously continues his onslaught of criticism for the Catholic Church, showing the Inquisitor to be nothing more than a worldly womanizer.  He also stereotypes Don Issachar, portraying him as a greedy, selfish money-grubber who hopes to buy himself earthly happiness.

Chapter 10
 Having left an inn where they had stayed the day before, the trio soon realizes that a Franciscan friar, who was also at the inn, must have stolen their gold and diamonds.  To overcome the loss, the old woman suggests, and the others agree, that they should sell one of the horses.
	Eventually they reach Cadiz, a city on the Atlantic coast.  When Candide demonstrates the sign of the Bulgar army, he is made a captain of sorts as he, Cunégonde and the old woman begin their journey to South America.  Candide, obviously still influenced by the optimistic philosophy of his youth, comes to rest on the idea that the New World will be the ""best of all worlds.""
	Yet soon, both Candide and Cunégonde realize that the trials and tribulations of their own lives are not unique or unusual at all when the old woman tells them that their horrors pale in comparison to hers.  She then launches into a lengthy story of her life's misfortunes, making continued allusions to a missing portion of her rear end.

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 11-12,"Chapter 11
In this chapter the old woman begins to narrate her own life story.  First, she explains how she was born as the bastard child of Pope Urban XX.  Next, the woman proceeds to boast about her past beauty, as well as about her handsome fiancé who suddenly dies just before their wedding. 
At another time, traveling on a papal ship of sorts, she is attacked by invading pirates who strip everyone aboard, fondling the women in the process.  It's interesting to see how Voltaire even uses this woman in his ongoing indictment of the Church.  Though the ship is supposedly defended by papal bodyguards, the old woman doesn't seem to have too high of a regard for them, as she explains the incident: ""Our soldiers defended themselves as papal troops usually do; falling on their knees and throwing down their arms..""
	Used as a personal slave by the African captain, who takes her virginity, the woman, along with her mother and chambermaids, is taken to Morocco to be sold.  When they arrive, they find themselves in the middle of a bloody civil war, which soon claims the lives of everyone except the woman.  With much effort, she manages to drag herself to a nearby stream, where she is approached by an Italian man who sees her beauty and groans about having lost his testicles.
	Voltaire, besides indicting the Roman Catholic Church, also criticizes Islam in this chapter.  The woman subtlety notes how the disciples of Muhammad scrupulously took time out of killing each other to say their five daily prayers mandated by their religion.  Other themes seen in this chapter center around war and man's cruelty to his fellow man.  Voltaire is strongly anti-war, obviously, showing it to be a needless slaughter of human life. 

Chapter 12
The old woman continues her story, as she explains how the kind man cares for her.  Soon, however, the man, who at one time worked as a court singer to the Princess of Palestrina-the woman's mother-shows he cannot be trusted.  For instead of bringing her back to Italy as he promised, he instead sells her in Algiers.  Through this ordeal, she comes down with the plague.  Though she survives, she's sold and resold as a slave to countless merchants and traders.  At one point her captors, facing starvation, even remove one of her buttocks for food.  Finally she ends up as a servant to Don Issachar, the Jew who also buys Cunégonde at a later date.  Finishing her story, she concludes with the thesis with which she began: she is the most miserable of human beings.

Candide: Novel Summary: Chapters 13-14,"Chapter 13
 As the story returns to the present, Candide and Cunégonde agree with the woman that she has suffered more than anyone else on the ship.  Next, Candide muses to himself, oddly enough, that he wishes Pangloss were present so that he could ""politely"" object to his master's optimistic philosophy.  This brief admission is very significant, for it marks a serious change in Candide's already shifting belief in optimism.
After reaching Buenos Aires, Candide and company quickly encounter the governor, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueoa y Mascarenes y Campourdos y Souza.  Voltaire purposefully exaggerates his name in order to satirize the man, and the presumptuousness of the nobility in general.  It soon becomes evident that the governor, as expected, is rude and arrogant, as he aggressively pursues Cunégonde's hand in marriage after merely seeing the girl's beauty.
Startled by the sudden arrival of the police, hot on Candide's trail, the old woman urges Cunégonde to earn a life of luxury by marrying the governor.
Chapter 14
 In this chapter, the reader, for the first time, meets Cacambo, a servant/friend of sorts to Candide who has come from Spain.  Fleeing the authorities who are in the process of boarding the ship, Candide and Cacambo hurriedly flee to Paraguay, though Candide regrets having to leave his lover behind. 
	As they enter the country, Cacambo explains to Candide that Paraguay is owned and run by the Jesuits, Los Padres.  According to Camambo, Paraguay is a utopia.  Los Padres are reasonable and just, though they are at war with the Spaniards in this hemisphere and ""send them to heaven"" in Europe.  Here, obviously, Voltaire satirizes the Jesuits for their hypocritical and corrupt religious war, as they slaughter in the New World the very people they baptize and bury in the Old World.
	As Candide and his servant enter a Jesuit outpost of some kind, the guards arrest the pair, treating them almost as prisoners.  When they realize that Candide is German, however, the soldiers quickly change their tune, instead treating Candide and his friend like royalty.  Having been taken to their commander, Candide soon realizes that this man is the baron's son, Cun�gonde's brother, who was reportedly killed by the Bulgars.

The commander, Cunégonde's brother, also referred to by Voltaire as the baron, explains to Candide the events following the Bulgar invasion.  Though his parents were killed and his sister raped, he was befriended by a Jesuit priest, who sent him to Rome, and eventually to Paraguay, letting him serve both the church and the state as a colonel and priest.
Candide and the baron seem to be getting along fine until Candide mentions his desire to marry Cunégonde.  Hearing this, the commander immediately scoffs and even threatens the young philosopher, and a sword fight quickly ensues.  Candide kills his future brother-in-law, and Cacambo, waiting nearby, organizes a fast escape for himself and his master.
	 
Chapter 16
Volaire's 16th chapter is definitely one of his most interesting.  Now in the wilderness of South America, Candide and Cacambo hear the screams of two young women nearby.  Investigating further, they realize that two monkeys are chasing the girls, who run naked.  Lifting his rifle, Candide kills both animals, believing that he has saved the two young girls.  Shocked, he sees the girls turn around, coming back to embrace the monkeys with whom they had frolicked.  Cacambo tries to explain all of this to his master, saying that these women are ignorant of the reason of Europe, and thus engage in the irrational, carnal pleasures of life. 
	Waking up from their sleep a few hours later, Candide and his valet find themselves tied with vines and surrounded by forest natives called Biglugs (Orejones in Spanish).  Apparently the two girls had told their people about the shooting of their lovers, and these Indians found the culprits as they slept. 
	Luckily, the shrewd Cacambo, who even knows some of the local language, speaks to the captors brilliantly about how he and his master are not their Jesuit enemies, but indeed friends.  Hearing this, the natives release their two prisoners, wishing them well.  Candide is elated that his life is spared, even asserting that these people, uncorrupted by civilization, are the best people in the world.  This theory that nature is utopian was taught to him earlier by Pangloss.

 In this chapter the reader is introduced to the most genuine description of utopia in the novel-Eldorado.  Letting a river guide them, they accidentally (or perhaps providentially) end up in the land of gold and jewels.  Candide thinks to himself that surely this is the best of all possible worlds, as his teacher always said really did exist.
Chapter 18
 Having been taken to an old man's home, Candide and Cacambo are told the history of El Dorado, which was at one time part of the Inca empire.  Soon they begin discussing religion, and Candide is relieved to know that the people of this land worship a single deity.  Though they don't pray to this god (since there's nothing for which to pray), they do thank Him in everything they do.  Everyone is a priest, the man explains; there is no need for monks or other church officials since this world is a utopia.
	Tooled with several red sheep to haul their carriage, Candide and his servant go to the king's castle.  Touring the capital, they realize that there are no government institutions, no prisons and no need for lawyers. 
	Having spent a month in this place, both Candide and his friend being to grow restless, and Candide in particular greatly misses his lovely Cungonde.  The two, thus, make plans to leave the place, taking with them enough golden pebbles to make them the richest men alive in their former world.

Having left Eldorado, Candide and Cacambo begin their journey back to Europe.  After several days into their long trek have passed, however, they have lost all but two of their sheep.  Seeing an abused African slave stretched out on the road before them, the two question him, and learn that a very religious Christian man is his master.  Hearing this, Candide admits to himself, ""I'm through, I must give up [Pangloss'] optimism after all... It is a mania for saying things are well when one is in hell.""
Next, Candide and Cacambo agree to split up, with Candide deciding to wait in Venice for Camabo, who agrees to return to Buenos Aires to bribe the governor to hand over Cunégonde.  Unfortunately for Candide, a sly merchant steals two of his diamonds.  Angry and dejected, Candide tries to get the authorities involved, but they are less than helpful or polite.  Soon he resolves to himself that if there is a place where everything is for the best, ""it is in Eldorado and not in the rest of the world.""
	Wanting a companion for his voyage, he asks a few nearby people if they wish to travel with him in exchange for lodging and money.  Wanting to reward the most unlucky applicant, Candide finally selects a scholar who seems to have had a horrible lot in life.
Chapter 20
The scholar, named Martin, who Voltaire explains is very learned in the area of identifying moral evil, and Candide, who is also quite practiced in the art, begin their journey.  Despite his experience, Voltaire admits that his protagonist still subscribes to optimism, since he still has hope of one day seeing Cunégonde. 
	Talking philosophy with his new valet, Candide learns that Martin is a Manichee, a believer in a world with almost equal amounts of good and evil.  He sums up his philosophy, saying, ""In a word, I have seen so much and suffered so much, that I am a Manichee.""
	Outside they see two warring ships, one of which sinks.  Eventually Candide learns, when a red sheep floats to the surface, that the sunken ship carried his stolen treasure.  Candide tries to use this event to his advantage in his argument with Martin, asserting that the thief received his just reward.  Martin, however, astutely points out that many innocent people also died when the ship went down.

 Finally, Candide and Martin reach France.  It soon becomes obvious to the reader that Martin has a very little regard for Paris social society, as he describes its inhabitants as a mob, always seeking pleasure but never finding it. 
Candide, sensing Martin's distaste for the country, explains that he doesn't want to stay long himself, but simply plans to use France as a way to get to Venice, where he will wait for his beloved Cunégonde. 
Martin seems to be very disillusioned with life, saying that he's seen it all.  When Candide asks him if he believes men have always been evil, Martin responds in the affirmative, comparing humans to hawks-species which live by instinct.  Candide tries to refute his argument, however, asserting that man has free will.

Chapter 22
 Candide decides to visit Paris while he and Martin pass through France.  While staying in a hotel, all of those around Candide try to take advantage of him, hoping to siphon off some of his wealth.  They cheat him at cards, seduce him, and even pretend to be Cunégonde herself (of course a very sick, mute Cunégonde who cannot be exposed to light), in order to exhort his money-and each scheme is very successful.  Later, they see a play at the theater and one of the actresses in the production reminds Candide of Cunégonde.  Next, being entertained at a home where he meets a wise man, Candide immediately asks him if he subscribes to Pangloss' philosophy of optimism.  The man says he doesn't, maintaining that ""everything goes wrong in our world.."" Candide responds by repeating Pangloss' teaching that ""troubles are just the shadows in a beautiful picture."" At this point, however, Martin asserts that ""the shadows are horrible ugly blots.""
Later, though he feels guilty about it afterwards, Candide is unfaithful to Cunégonde with the ""lady"" of the household, who simply wanted (and received) his diamonds.  Eventually, Candide grows fed up with the scheming which surrounds him, so he tells Martin that they must escape from this ""hell."" Though not yet going towards Venice, Candide is happy enough just to get to England.

	Hearing this, Candide is taken aback and consequently refuses to set foot on English soil, instead arranging for his passage directly to Venice.  Finally reaching Venice a few days later, Candide resurrects a lesser version of Pangloss' optimism, saying, ""all goes as well as possible.""
	Chapter 24: Now in Venice, Candide makes his first priority to find Cacambo, hoping that he has brought Cunegonde.  After a few days of fruitless searching, he grows despairing, finally resolving to Martin that Cunegonde is dead, that ""all is but illusion and disaster.""
	Turning a moment from his deep sadness, Candide sees a monk and a prostitute walking down the street, arm in arm.  Candide bets Martin that the couple is happy.  After he invites them to dinner, Candide realizes that the young girl is Paquette, the maidservant to his old baroness and the woman who gave Pangloss the STD.  Quickly she fills Candide in on the miseries of her own life.  The monk also explains how he is quite unhappy with his lot in life.  After hearing all of this, Candide is forced to admit that Martin has won the bet. 
	After giving both Paquette and the monk some money, Candide begins to arrange for his and Martin's next meeting: a meeting with Senator Pocourante, apparently ""a man who has never known a moment's grief.""

Chapter 25: Now inside the senator's home, Candide and Martin find that the man is not at all satisfied with his life or his many possessions, but is constantly critical or cynical about all that he has.  For example, his paintings by Rafael don't please him, Homer bores him and he finds neither the writing of Virgil, Horace or Milton very great. 
	Later, when Candide and Martin discuss their visit alone, Candide tries to salvage his premise that Pocourante is the happiest of all men, saying that there must be some kind of pleasure in ""seeing faults where other people think they see beauties."" Yet when Martin challenges his thesis, Candide admits that perhaps only he himself is optimistic at the prospect of again seeing Cunegonde.
	Chapter 26: While Candide is waiting in his hotel for dinner to be served, Cacambo, serving as a waiter, reveals himself to his old friend, saying that he is a slave now and that Cunegonde isn't with him, but is staying in Constantinople.  Cacambo tells Candide that he has arranged for a ship to take him to his lover.  This is the main plot development of the chapter, though an interesting side note to the story is the account of the six kings who are dining with Candide and Martin.  Apparently even the royalty cannot escape the miseries of life, as they reveal their identities to Candide and to each other, explaining the horrible fortunes which have befallen them.

 Now boarding the ship, the relentless Candide again tries to resurrect Pangloss' optimism in front of Martin, asserting that since his circumstances might be worse, all must be for the best.  Martin, of course, is skeptical.
Next speaking to Cacambo, Candide learns that Cunégonde too is a slave, working as a dishwasher, and ugly to boot.  Candide, however, says that he doesn't care what she looks like, as long as he can see her again.
	Walking about on ship, Candide spies two convicts who bear a remarkable resemblance to Cunégonde's brother, the baron, and Dr. Pangloss, both thought to be dead.  Getting closer, he realizes that indeed it is them, alive, though not well.  Motioning to the captain, Candide arranges to pay for their release.

Chapter 28
Both the baron and Pangloss explain the circumstances which led to them escaping death. Cunégonde's brother says that he was healed of the sword wound inflicted upon him by Candide.  Pangloss explains how he narrowly escaped hanging, thanks to a knot that stopped the rope from completely suffocating him.  Both men, however, get into trouble (the baron by swimming with an Arab, Pangloss by fondling a young women in a mosque), resulting in their arrest and subsequent captivity.
	Nevertheless, the philosopher still maintains his belief in deterministic optimism, asserting, ""I am a philosopher, and it would not be right for me to recant since Leibniz could not possibly be wrong.""

Summary
	The story opens at the opera in New York. In the audience is the novel's protagonist, Newland Archer, a cultured young man from the city's fashionable 'old money' society. Archer sees the girl he is to marry, May Welland, sitting in the box of the matriarch of her family, old Mrs Catherine Manson Mingott.
	Mrs Mingott herself is too obese to attend. She is a respected figure in New York society, due to her indomitable nature and the impeccable decency of her life.
	Archer reflects ardently on the innocence of his fiancee, and looks forward to educating her. Conversely, he would also like her to be as worldly-wise as his former married lover.
	Also at the opera are Lawrence Lefferts, the foremost authority on form in New York, and Sillerton Jackson, an expert on society scandals. Lefferts is shocked to see Countess Ellen Olenska, May's cousin, in the Mingotts' box. Ellen has returned from Europe, where she was living with her philandering husband, a Polish Count. She has left him - an act unacceptable to the high society of the time - and reportedly had an affair with his secretary. Such is the disgrace into which Ellen has fallen that even Newland Archer, who approves of the Mingotts' private support for her, is disturbed at their publicly introducing her into their opera box. After all, this is the same box in which his wife-to-be is sitting. Their engagement is to be announced in a few weeks.
	Archer decides that he must act to restore dignity to May's family and to help her through the ordeal. He visits their box and suggests to May that he should bring forward the announcement of their engagement to that night, at the Beauforts' ball.
	Archer is introduced to Ellen. She recalls that they used to play together as children and that he was a ""horrid boy"" who kissed her behind a door. Archer is shocked at her disrespect for the fashionable society which is effectively her judge.
	Julius and Regina Beaufort hold an annual ball in a room kept only for that purpose, a luxury which ""was felt to compensate for whatever was regrettable in the Beaufort past"" (Chapter 3, p. 16). Beaufort was a banker in his native England before he left amid rumors of shady financial dealings.
	When Archer arrives at the ball, he sees that May is announcing their engagement to her circle. She asks him if he has told Ellen of their engagement. He has been reluctant to speak of it to her, but tells May falsely that he has not had the chance. May urges him to do so, since Ellen is feeling sensitive and May does not want her to feel forgotten. Archer agrees to tell Ellen, but May says that she has not come to the ball, deciding at the last minute that her dress was not smart enough. Archer knows that the real reason Ellen has stayed away is shame at her reputation, but he admires May's determination to ""ignore the unpleasant"" in refraining from mentioning this. He in turn does not show May that he knows what lies behind Ellen's absence.
	Analysis
	It is significant that the novel opens at the opera. This introduces one of the recurring metaphors of the novel: that of performance, or keeping up an appearance of correct and moral behavior, whatever the reality might be. Repeatedly in this novel we encounter characters who behave badly but are welcome in New York society because they are discreet. (Julius Beaufort is an example.) The minute the facade slips and their offences against morality or taste become public knowledge, they are punished or even ostracized.
	Wharton conveys the ease with which the unwary or unschooled can slip into the many social pitfalls: "". in metropolises it was 'not the thing' to arrive early at the opera; and what was or was not 'the thing' played a part as important in Newland Archer's New York as the inscrutable totem errors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago."" (Chapter 1, p. 4)
	Newland Archer is disconcerted by Ellen Olenska's appearance in the Mingotts' opera box because it is an offence against taste. While Ellen put up with her unhappy marriage, she was accepted, but when she left her husband with his secretary, her public offence against morality placed her beyond the pale of respectability. Ellen's disregard for the conventions of society becomes obvious in her first conversation with Archer. Instead of showing a fitting humility and seriousness before her high society judges (of whom Archer is a representative), she paints an undignified - but very human - picture of him and herself as children. Archer cannot tell Ellen about his engagement to May, a sign that the two inhabit two different worlds that Archer will fail to reconcile.
	May Welland, seen through Archer's eyes, provides a contrast to Ellen. Her innocence is symbolized throughout the novel by the lilies-of-the-valley that form her bouquets. The lily-of-the-valley is a white flower which traditionally connotes purity and chastity. Archer feels happy at the thought that in her innocence, she does not even understand the seduction scene in the opera. Clearly, an innocence that depends on emotional ignorance is unlikely to stand up to the hardships of the real world.
	Another theme introduced in these chapters is the contrast between the strict adherence to accepted morality in New York, embodied in May, and what is seen as the moral ambiguities of old Europe, embodied in Ellen.
	New York high society, with its complex system of manners and mores, is the constant reference point against which most of the characters view themselves. They act to please society rather than themselves, in order to preserve the smooth running of the community. A tension is set up between the individual and society, and in the case of Ellen, that tension has been stretched almost to breaking point. She, uniquely at this point in the novel, has acted to please herself and earned the disapproval of her community. The implicit question is how this tension will be resolved: will she bend to society's dictates for the sake of a quiet life, or will she continue to carve her own destiny?
	One way in which Wharton conveys the hypocrisy of society is by having characters refrain from saying what they truly think. Both Archer and May know the real reason why Ellen did not go to the ball at the Beauforts', but they keep up the pretence, even to each other, that it is because she didn't have a suitable dress. Archer admires May's ability to ""carry to the utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the 'unpleasant' in which they had both been brought up"" (Chapter 3, p. 22). Again, a tension is created, in this case between what characters know to be reality and what they pretend or express. We feel that this is a tenuous state that cannot sustain itself, and wait in suspense for the cracks to appear.

The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 4-6,"Chapters 4-6
Summary
	Archer and May begin their round of betrothal visits by calling on May's family matriarch, Catherine Manson Mingott, at her home. Mrs Mingott cannot go upstairs because of her obesity, and has arranged her sitting room on the ground floor, with her bedroom in full view of guests. This shockingly recalls ""scenes in French fiction, and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed of. That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies. ."" It amuses Archer to think of ""her blameless life led in the stage-setting of adultery"" (Chapter 4, p. 24).
	To everyone's relief, Ellen Olenska is not present when the betrothed couple arrive. Mrs Mingott gives the couple her blessing and asks when the wedding will be. Mrs Welland offers a show of reluctance to hurry it. Ellen enters with Julius Beaufort. Archer tells her about the engagement, which she already knows of. As she bids him goodbye, she asks him to come and visit her.
	After the Wellands leave, they discuss the occasion, taking care not to mention Ellen. But Archer knows that Mrs Welland disapproves of Ellen's being seen out walking with Beaufort, and also feels that Ellen should know that a recently engaged man does not call on married women. He is glad that he is to marry ""one of his own kind.""
	Archer's mother, Mrs Archer, is shy but likes to know what is going on in society, so she invites the expert, Sillerton Jackson, to dinner. The unspoken implication is that she wants to know about Ellen. Archer is at the dinner, as is his sister Janey.
	Eventually, after pretending to be interested in other topics of conversation, Mrs Archer asks Sillerton if Ellen was at the Beauforts' ball, and Sillerton replies that she was not. They discuss her in patronizing terms, Mrs Archer remarking that little can be expected of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming-out ball (presumably, a more demure color and fabric would be more fitting).
	During the discussion about Ellen that follows, Archer defends her actions against the disapproving company. He defends her right to be conspicuous if she wishes, applauds the secretary for helping her escape from her husband, and hopes that she gets a divorce (divorce was an unusual and stigmatizing action at this time).
	After dinner, Archer and Sillerton retire to the library. Sillerton tells Archer that the secretary did not merely help Ellen, but was living with her a year later in Lausanne, Switzerland. Archer is embarrassed but continues to stand up for Ellen, defending her right to make her life anew with whoever she pleases, especially since her husband preferred to live with harlots. ""Women ought to be free - as free as we are,"" he says, condemning the double standard prevalent at the time that allowed men, but not women, to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. Sillerton comments that Count Olenski evidently agrees with Archer, since he has not tried to get his wife back.
	Archer reflects on the case of the unconventional Ellen and his approaching marriage to the traditional May, ""that terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything."" Now that his settled convictions have been shaken up by Ellen's story, May seems like a stranger, and marriage no longer a ""safe anchorage"" but ""a voyage on uncharted seas"" (Chapter 6, p. 36).
	The author undermines Archer's championing of the freedom of women by commenting that, from his point of view, "" 'Nice' women, however wronged, would never claim the kind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were therefore - in the heat of argument - the more ready to concede it to them."" (Chapter 6, p. 37)
	However, it is clear that Archer is questioning the convention whereby out of decency, men were expected to conceal their past from their wives-to-be, and women were not allowed to have any past at all: what could he and May really know of each other? He worries that his marriage might become what most other marriages around him were: ""a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on one side and hypocrisy on the other."" (Chapter 6, p. 37) An example is Lawrence Lefferts, whose well-trained wife averts her gaze indignantly when someone mentions Julius Beaufort's maintaining a mistress and yet turns a blind eye to her husband's love affairs.
	Archer is also questioning the value of May's innocence, which he now views as oppressive, a creation ""manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to be what he wanted."" (Chapter 6, p. 39). His doubts have been prompted by the case of Ellen.
	Mrs Lovell Mingott sends out invitations ""To meet the Countess Olenska."" However, everyone refuses, except the Beauforts and Sillerton Jackson. Ellen has been snubbed. Archer is outraged. Mrs Archer intervenes by going to see Louisa van der Luyden, whose family, descended from Dutch aristocracy, stands at the head of New York society. She says that she is doing this for May's sake and for the sake of society (not, it seems, for Ellen's sake, who seems the one most in need of help).
	Analysis
	Because of Mrs Mingott's powerful place in New York society and her blameless life, she is able to transgress some of the forms of correctness, such as having her bedroom in full view of guests. She feels a kinship with Julius Beaufort, since both possess an ability to take ""short-cuts through the conventions"" (Chapter 4, p. 26)
	Ellen shocks Archer with her ignorance or carelessness of convention in inviting him to call on her, a married woman. He prides himself on his cosmopolitan views, but is glad that he is allying himself to ""one of his own kind,"" May Welland.
	Mrs Archer and her daughter know all about Julius Beaufort's shady history, but they avoid talking about it openly. The Beauforts are, however, accepted and even courted because the scandal is not in public view, illustrating the extreme hypocrisy of fashionable society. Nevertheless, Mrs Archer, born into 'old money' and 'good family', believes Beaufort to be vulgar.
	The theme of hypocrisy, in the sense of hiding one's true thoughts and feelings under a system of codes, continues in the narrator's comment on Mrs Archer and her son: "". it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts"" (Chapter 5, p. 32).
	We see a new and refreshing side of Archer when this young man, who has thus far appeared rather conventional, condemns the double standard prevalent in society at the time that allowed men, but not women, the freedom to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. However, the narrator points out dryly that he has not thought through the implications of his progressive view, perhaps with regard to his own traditional marriage. The author goes on to undermine Archer's championing of women's freedom as ""humbugging disguise"" (Chapter 6, p. 37), as, from his point of view, 'nice' women would not claim the kind of freedom he meant, and thus generous-minded men like himself were the more ready to concede it to them.
	But Ellen's case has stirred up his old settled convictions, so that marriage seems less like a ""safe anchorage"" than ""a voyage on uncharted seas,"" and May, the traditional girl who ""knew nothing and expected everything,"" now seems disconcertingly like a stranger.
	The narrator uses Archer's reflection on the falseness of most marriages to make an observation on the hypocrisy of New York society that could stand as emblematic of The Age of Innocence: ""In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs."" (Chapter 6, p. 38). An example is Mrs Archer's pretence of reluctance at bringing forward the announcement of the engagement, when, in fact, she is eager to see the marriage happen soon.
	Archer's new vision of May's innocence as a product carefully manufactured by relatives casts an ironic light on the novel's title. Through Archer, Wharton seems to ask, what is the value of the 'innocence' that girls aspire to and which men are supposed to want in a wife? Wharton's own answer, given through Archer's point of view, seems clear: ""He could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the Babes in the Wood."" (Chapter 6, p. 39).

Summary
	Mrs Archer and her son call on the van der Luydens to ask for their help in the case of the snubbing of Ellen. The Archers believe that the snubbing has been orchestrated by Lawrence Lefferts to divert attention from his own illicit affair.
	The van der Luydens agree to support Ellen, who is a relative of theirs. Henry van der Luyden says that Mrs van der Luyden's aristocratic relative, the Duke of St Austrey, is coming to visit next week. The van der Luydens will invite Ellen to join them and their other guests.
	Chapter 8 tells us something of Ellen's background. She was the pretty daughter of ""continental wanderers,"" and had traveled with them until she was orphaned. Thereafter she was brought up by her aunt, Medora Manson, another wanderer. Medora was repeatedly widowed and would return to New York to settle down, each time to a less expensive house, suggesting that her fortunes were diminishing. New York society considered her eccentric and tolerated her only for her family connections.
	Ellen was taken to Italy by her aunt, Mrs Thorley Chivers, and became proficient in such barely respectable arts as Spanish dancing, drawing live models, and playing the piano with professional musicians. She later married a rich Polish count. A few years later, Medora again returned to New York, looking for a yet cheaper house. Soon, news arrived that Ellen's marriage had ended disastrously and that she too was returning to New York.
	Archer sees Ellen at the van der Luydens' dinner for the Duke of St Austrey. The Duke, a shabbily dressed, unassuming man who nevertheless commands great respect by dint of his ""credentials,"" goes to sit next to Ellen and talks with her.
	Later, Ellen rises and goes to sit next to Archer - a breach of the custom which requires a woman to sit immobile and converse with any man who decides to approach her. Ellen shocks Archer by calling the Duke dull and asking if Archer's coming marriage was arranged. She is embarrassed by her mistake, which was prompted by her experience of Europe, and says she wants to forget her past and become a complete American again, like the Mingotts and Wellands.
	May arrives, but Archer stays next to Ellen. Others who had refused to meet Ellen at Mrs Lovell Mingott's house now talk with her, including the Leffertses. Ellen invites Archer to visit her the next day, and he agrees.
	The next day, Archer spends the day making more betrothal visits at the insistence of May's mother. He had wanted also to bring forward the wedding, planned for the following autumn, but Mrs Welland had refused because of the preparations.
	Archer calls on Ellen at her house, in a district of writers and artisans. He has not told May of this visit but excuses himself with the thought that he is obeying May's request to be kind to her cousin. Ellen is out when he arrives, so he is invited by the foreign maid into the drawing-room. He has time to look around the room, which feels like an adventure to him. There are Italian paintings the like of which he has never seen, and an exotic fragrance.
	Archer contrasts Ellen's house with the house that Mr Welland has his eye on for the newly-weds, newly built of a ghastly greenish-yellow stone. Archer would like to travel, but though the Wellands approve of an extended honeymoon in Europe, the couple will be expected to return to this house. He expects that May will decorate it in the pretentious style of her parents' house. He feels as if ""his fate was sealed""(Chapter 9, p. 61).
	Ellen arrives in Julius Beaufort's carriage. Beaufort had taken her to see some other houses, since the one she is living in is not in a fashionable street. Ellen first says that she wants to make her own fashions, but then contradicts herself by saying she has lived too independently, and now wants to do what everyone else does, to feel cared for and safe.
	Ellen asks Archer to help her understand the things she needs to know to survive socially. She says she counts him and Beaufort as her interpreters. Archer hates being linked with Beaufort.
	Archer tells Ellen to stay close to the older society women, as they wish to help her. Ellen replies that they wish to help as long as they don't hear anything unpleasant, and says, ""The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!"" She bursts into tears. Archer comforts her.
	The Duke of St Austrey arrives with a friend, Mrs Struthers, who, being seen as common, was not invited to the van der Luydens' but who wants to meet Ellen. Neither Ellen nor the Duke realize what a liberty he is taking in bringing the lady uninvited. Mrs Struthers invites Ellen and (as she assumes) her ""young man,"" Archer, to hear a famous pianist play at her house the next day. Ellen accepts. Archer leaves, and buys May the box of lilies-of-the-valley that he sends her daily. When he goes to the flower shop, he sees some bright yellow roses. He sends the roses to Ellen, without any indication of who they are from.
	Analysis
	The hypocrisy of New York society is emphasized by the eagerness of the Leffertses and other families who had declined to meet Ellen at Mrs Lovell Mingott's, to pay their respects to her now that she has been welcomed by the powerful van der Luydens.
	Wharton throws an ironic light on the book's title, as Archer, paraded about by Mrs Welland on endless betrothal visits, feels he is being ""shown off like a wild animal cunningly trapped"" (Chapter 9, p. 58). There is nothing innocent about this carefully contrived process.
	Ellen's house, shabby yet beautiful, full of exotic foreign paintings and fragrances, is contrasted with the house that Mr Welland plans for Archer and May - emphasizing the difference between the two women. It is newly-built of a ghastly greenish-yellow stone with a Pompeian-style vestibule. Archer imagines that May will decorate it like her parents' house, a thought which makes him feel ""that his fate was sealed"" (Chapter 9, p. 61) - again, an image of being trapped.
	Ellen's comment that being in New York is like ""being taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all one's lessons"" (Chapter 9, p. 63) reveals the conventional nature of society. In contrast to this conformity is set Ellen's careless disregard for convention. Ellen's upbringing, with its flaunting of convention, foreshadows her unconventional adulthood. Her life with the Count is viewed as disappearing into ""a kind of sulphurous apotheosis"" (Chapter 8, p. 51) - sulphur, of course, being the gas of hell. Ellen's childhood propensity for asking disconcerting questions has not deserted her: she asks Archer directly if he loves May and whether the marriage was arranged.
	Archer's increasing fascination with Ellen is betrayed by his forgetting to send May his usual box of lilies-of-the-valley. On impulse, he sends golden yellow roses to Ellen. The two different flowers, the one white, pure and chaste, the other rich, strong and fiery, symbolize the gulf between the two women, the different feelings they inspire in Archer, and the choice facing him.

Summary
	Archer tells May about his having sent roses to Ellen, though not about his visit to her; she approves of his kind gesture, but finds it odd that Ellen did not mention it.
	Archer is not happy about the long engagement, since he wants them to travel together as soon as possible, but May accepts it because her mother would not understand them wanting to do things differently. He is impatient at the seeming inability of 'nice' women to speak for themselves, but concedes that society does not encourage them to do so. He wonders if, when he removes the ""bandage"" of innocence from her eyes, she will be able to see, or whether she will be like the Kentucky cave-fish, which ceased to develop eyes because it had no use for them.
	He observes that he and May and others of the same class are ""all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper."" He asks her why he and she cannot strike out on their own. She suggests it would be ""vulgar."" He questions why she should fear this so much; she points out that he would not like it any more than she would.
	At his office, Archer begins to feel trapped by the day-to-day sameness of his job as a lawyer. His colleagues, he thinks, are discussing the Duke and the scandalous appearance of one of Julius Beaufort's mistresses driving her own carriage on Fifth Avenue. Archer's sister Janey comes in, angry that Ellen has been to Mrs Struthers' party, and Archer didn't try to stop her for the sake of the family honor. The van der Luydens are, she says, so offended that they are going to Skuytercliff, their country estate.
	Mrs Archer is incredulous that Archer is unrepentant at having upset the van der Luydens. Archer defends all those blamed for the offence - himself, Ellen and lastly, Mrs Struthers, who he says is amusing and offers good music. Mrs Archer wants her son to explain to the van der Luydens that Ellen comes from a different society. Archer says that he is not responsible; the culprit, if any, is the Duke, who introduced Mrs Struthers to Ellen and took Ellen to her party. But Mrs Archer says that the Duke is a guest and a stranger, whereas Ellen is a New Yorker ""and should have respected the feelings of New York.""
	Henry van der Luyden calls on the Archers. Henry talks appreciatively of Ellen's charm and artistic ability. But after hearing from Sillerton Jackson of her visit to Mrs Struthers, he has warned her about going to such parties.
	Mr Letterblair, head of the law firm where Archer works, tells him that members of May's family, including Mrs Mingott, Lovell Mingott and Mr Welland, have asked for Archer's advice on Ellen's wish to divorce her husband. The family does not want the divorce, but Ellen is insisting on a legal opinion. Archer reluctantly agrees to look at the case. He compares Ellen unfavorably with May, who would never hawk about her problems in this way.
	Archer reads letters between the Count and Ellen. In a fit of pity mixed with disgust, he agrees to see Ellen about the case. Archer has been conditioned to believe that men who have illicit love affairs are only foolish, whereas women who do so are criminal. But he now begins to question whether ""complicated"" European societies might produce less simple problems. Perhaps a woman might be drawn into such a situation through defenselessness and loneliness.
	He writes to Ellen asking when they might discuss the divorce, but she replies that she is going to the van der Luyden's estate, Skuytercliff, but could see him that Sunday. Archer dines with Letterblair, who agrees with the family that a divorce is unacceptable. Archer feels that Ellen is justified in wanting a divorce, but Letterblair pressures him into using his influence against the idea, in order to avoid marrying into a family with a scandalous divorce hanging over it.
	Archer says he would rather not give an opinion until he hears what Ellen has to say. He goes to the writers' and artists' quarter where she lives. Such people are unacceptable in New York society, though in other parts of the world they are feted. Archer knows most of them. One, the journalist Ned Winsett, is a friend.
	Ellen's maid, Nastasia, opens the door. Archer is angry when he sees Julius Beaufort's coat in the hall. Ellen is talking to Beaufort and, flaunting the dinner dress convention, is wearing a red velvet robe trimmed with black fur. Beaufort says it is a pity she is going away as he intended to invite her to a musical evening.
	Ellen dismisses Beaufort so that she can discuss business with Archer. She tells Archer that she is trying not to care so much about the arts, as part of her attempt to cast off her old life and become like everybody else. Turning to her divorce, she tells him that she wants to be free and feels that she is justified in this desire by Count Olenski's ""abominable"" behavior. But Archer warns her that if he contests the divorce, unpleasant things may be said about her which may harm her. She will gain nothing in return. She protests that her freedom is not ""nothing."" But he points out that the individual is, by custom, sacrificed to the collective interest. She unhappily agrees to do as he wishes.
	Analysis
	The schism between Archer and May grows, as is shown by his impatience with her acceptance of the long engagement and her inability to think independently. The comparison between the unworldly May and the Kentucky cave-fish, whose eyes had ceased to develop because it had no use for them, says much about Wharton's attitude to society's expectations of women. They were expected to be ignorant of worldly things. Archer's fear that there will be nothing of value under May's innocence is expressed in this sinister image: ""What if, when he had bidden May Welland to open [her eyes], they could only look out blankly at blankness?"" (Chapter 10, p. 70) The extent to which Archer is changing in his attitudes is evident from the contrast between this image and his paternalistic delight in May's innocence in the first chapter.
	Archer's musings reflect Wharton's own interest in feminist ideas. To what extent, she asks, can an individual, particularly a woman, carve out their own fate, and to what extent must they accept the fate that is approved by society? In Chapter 11, Wharton bitterly notes the double standards that apply in illicit love affairs: the man is seen, especially by other women, as merely foolish, the woman criminal.
	A gulf is growing between Ellen and the New York society she hopes to join. Ellen, in an attempt to fit in, is trying to become just like everybody else by caring less about the arts, which New York society does not value. But the van der Luydens are upset that she has gone to a party held by the ""common"" Mrs Struthers, and Mrs Archer and Janey are upset because the van der Luydens are upset.
	Archer's talk with Ellen about her divorce is a testing ground for where he stands in the conflict between the individual and society. Though privately he supports Ellen in her desire to be free, when he talks with her, he comes down firmly on the side of doing as society demands and not pursuing the divorce. His advice is to help seal his own and Ellen's fates.

Summary
	At the theatre, Archer is moved by an incident in the play. The leading man and lady sadly bid each other goodbye. The lady leans on the mantelpiece and buries her face in her hands. Unnoticed by her, her lover approaches and kisses the ribbon that hangs down her back before he leaves. She never knows this. Archer is reminded of his leave-taking from Ellen.
	Archer thinks that Count Olenski is correct in believing that Ellen and the secretary were lovers. He understands that she may have been prompted to this by gratefulness to her rescuer, but he also knows that these same actions would, in the eyes of the world, make her no better than her husband.
	The Welland-Mingott family is delighted that Archer has talked Ellen out of the divorce. Mrs Mingott believes it is better to be a married woman and a Countess than plain Ellen Mingott and an old maid.
	In the theatre, Archer visits Ellen in the Beauforts' box. Ellen asks Archer if the lover in the play will send his lady a bunch of yellow roses in the morning - a reference to his own gifts to her. Archer is embarrassed but pleased that she associates his gifts with the tender scene in the play. He admits that he was going to leave the theatre then so as to take the picture with him. She asks what he does when May is away (the Wellands have gone to St Augustine). He works, he says. She tells him that she thinks he was right about the divorce, and she is following his advice.
	As he is leaving the theatre, Archer runs into his journalist friend, Ned Winsett. Ned noticed Ellen in Beaufort's box and asks Archer who she is. She lives near Ned and rescued his son, who had fallen and cut himself. Ned is amazed that a Countess should live in his area, but Archer says she does not care where she lives, ""or about any of our little social sign-posts"" (Chapter 14, p. 104). Winsett too has only contempt for such things.
	Winsett is not a journalist by choice; he is a literary man, but could not make money from it. He advises Archer to enter politics, to ""roll up your sleeves and get right down into the muck,"" in order to avoid the otherwise inevitable fate of his entire class - being ""like the pictures on the walls of a deserted house"" (Chapter 14, p. 106). But Archer believes that a gentleman could not go into politics.
	Next morning, Archer looks in vain for yellow roses to send to Ellen, and is late for work. His absence makes no difference to anyone: though it is proper for wealthy young men to have a profession, they achieve very little. He worries that after he marries, he may not be able to pursue his real interests, European travel and talking to ""clever people,"" which even now are confined to the margins of his life.
	From the office, he sends a message to Ellen asking if he might call that afternoon. On the third morning he gets a reply from her at Skuytercliff. She writes that she ran away to think things over and that she feels safe there. Archer had just refused an invitation from friends, the Chiverses, who live near Skuytercliff. Now, he sends them a telegram saying he will come after all.
	Archer visits Skuytercliff from his base at the Chivers' house, but Ellen is out at church with Mrs van der Luyden. He goes to meet the carriage and meets Ellen walking along the road. He tells her he came to see what she was running away from. She says it does not matter, now that he is here to protect her. He asks her what has happened. She takes him to the van der Luydens' Patroon's house, which Mr van der Luyden has opened up, to tell him in privacy. He again asks her what she is running from. She puts her hand into his but, before she can reply, Julius Beaufort arrives. Ellen is surprised to see him, but Archer draws away from Ellen and invites Beaufort in, telling him dryly that he is expected.
	It becomes clear to Archer that Ellen did not know Beaufort was coming, and that she is annoyed by his presence. The narrator tells us that Ellen was running away from Beaufort: the question is whether she was running because his attentions displeased her, or whether she did not trust herself to resist them. Archer worries that she is drawn to Beaufort by his cosmopolitan background and his familiarity with artistic people.
	Archer returns to New York, where he feels that he is being ""buried alive under his future"" (Chapter 16, p. 199). Several days later, he receives a note from Ellen asking him to visit her the next day, so that she can explain. But instead, he leaves to join the Wellands at St Augustine.
	Analysis
	The leave-taking scene at the theatre, full of unspoken emotion, is to become highly symbolic to Archer, who feels that it represents his leave-taking from Ellen. The metaphor of performance expresses the fact that Archer and Ellen have had to pretend and not been true to their love.
	Archer is given an opportunity to become closer to Ellen by responding to her invitation to continue the intimate discussion that was foiled at Skuytercliff. But instead, he goes to join May at St Augustine, choosing what is 'right' over what he thinks he wants.
	Archer's loyalties are torn between his drive to individuality and his drive to conform to society's conventions. On one hand, he approves of Ellen's leaving her husband, but he advises her to avoid the stigma of divorce. He intends to make a conventional marriage, but associates with bohemian types like Winsett.
	Archer's divided sense of self is shown too in his theoretical championing of women's freedom, which he finds difficult to put into practice. He jealously assumes that Beaufort and Ellen are having an affair. Under this apprehension, he speaks to her contemptuously. Evidently, he is allowed to continue his engagement to May while secretly loving Ellen, but she is not allowed similar freedom.
	The futility of Archer's life as his marriage looms is a strong theme of this section. His lateness at the office makes no difference to anybody; he is a lawyer only because it is expected that a gentleman will have an occupation. His interests lie in European travel and cultivating what his sister calls ""clever people,"" but he worries about what will happen when he marries: ""what would become of the narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived?"" (Chapter 14, p. 107)

Summary
	Archer arrives at St Augustine, impatient to bring forward the date of his marriage. Letterblair indulges Archer over his absence from work on the grounds that Archer dealt with the Olenski divorce to the satisfaction of the Welland-Mingott family. Mrs Welland thanks Archer for using his influence to dissuade Ellen from the divorce, and mentions that Ellen has unbounded admiration for him. Mrs Welland wonders what Ellen's fate will be. Archer thinks (though does not say) that it will be what they all contrive to make it: denied a divorce and the freedom to marry some decent man, she may be forced into becoming Beaufort's mistress.
	Archer does not want May's innocence to be like her mother's - an innocence that ""seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience"" (Chapter 16, p. 123). Mrs Welland tells Archer that she refused to listen when Ellen tried to talk to her about her situation. Mr Welland grew so upset at the prospect of May learning ""that such things were possible"" that he became ill (Chapter 16, p. 124).
	Archer presses May to allow their marriage to be brought forward. She wonders why it should be so important, and asks Archer if it is because he is not certain of continuing to care for her and because there is someone else. She wants them to talk frankly. He does not manage this, however, answering her question with another: if he felt their coming wedding was a mistake, why would he try to hasten it? May answers that he might want to settle the question by decisive action. She believes her rival is Mrs Rushworth. She tells Archer she does not want her happiness made out of a wrong to another. She believes that if two people love each other, there may be situations in which they should go against public opinion. She offers to give him up for this other woman.
	Archer is awe-struck at having escaped confessing his feelings for Ellen, and by May's generosity. He does not admit to loving anyone else. He tells her he feels as she does on the pointlessness of conventionalities, and asks again if they can bring their marriage forward. May seems timorous, and Archer drops the subject.
	Archer calls on Mrs Mingott, and tells her that May refused to hasten the marriage. Mrs Mingott thinks her family are ""in a rut."" She is thankful that she is ""vulgar,"" and adds that the only one of her family who takes after her is Ellen. She asks Archer why he did not marry Ellen. He says she wasn't there to be married, and asks Mrs Mingott to use her influence to hasten his marriage to May.
	Ellen arrives. Mrs Mingott tells Ellen that Archer rushed to St Augustine to try to bring his marriage forward. Ellen suggests to Mrs Mingott that they might persuade the Wellands to do as Archer wishes.
	Archer visits Ellen at her home and meets there Ned Winsett and the bohemian Medora Manson. Also present is Dr Agathon Carver, founder of an alternative community called ""The Valley of Love."" Dr Carver leaves. Medora thanks Archer for his good advice to Ellen over the divorce. Count Olenski has petitioned Medora to persuade Ellen to take him back, on her terms. Medora stresses the material benefits of being married to the Count. She asks Archer to support her in convincing Ellen to return to her husband. Archer replies that he would rather see her dead.
	Ellen enters and tells her maid to throw away the flowers that the Count has sent her, but then sends them instead to Ned Winsett's wife, who is ill.
	Left alone with Ellen, Archer tells her that May wants a long engagement to give him time to give her up for another woman. Ellen is struck by May's nobility. Ellen suggests that he does not care for anyone else, but Archer corrects her: he does not mean to marry anyone else. She asks if the other woman loves him, but he denies that there is another woman. Ellen's carriage arrives to take her to Mrs Struthers'. Archer, wanting to keep Ellen with him, admits that May is right. There is another woman, though not the one May thinks. He tells Ellen he would have married her if it had been possible. Ellen points out that it is he who has made it impossible, by opposing her divorce; he showed her how selfish it would be, and that she must sacrifice herself to spare the family from scandal. For the sake of him and May and the family, she did as he asked. Archer sinks into despair as he realizes what he has done.
	Ellen begins to cry. They kiss, and Archer comforts her, saying that nothing is done that cannot be undone. He is still free, and she could be. But Ellen says it is too late to alter their course, as he has taught her to hate ""happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference"" (Chapter 18, p. 146). She cannot love him unless she gives him up.
	Ellen's maid comes in with a telegram. It is from May, telling Ellen that due to Mrs Mingott's intervention, May's parents have agreed to an earlier wedding. Archer laughs bitterly: his fate has been settled.
	Analysis
	The damage wreaked by New York society's repressive mores is made clear in Archer's ironic comment that Ellen, denied a divorce and the freedom to marry a decent man, could be forced into becoming Beaufort's mistress. In a further irony, however, Wharton has him think this comment without speaking it out: to do so would render him socially unacceptable. With no one prepared to make waves, the smooth surface of New York society remains unbroken.
	The unrealistic expectations placed on women by New York society are made clear by Archer's wish that May has innocence, but not like her mother's - ""the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience"" (Chapter 16, p. 123). Archer is more drawn to Ellen's greater experience and depth, but he draws back from embracing it fully.
	That May understands more than Archer gives her credit for is revealed when she suspects that he wants to hasten their marriage because he is not certain of continuing to care for her. May, whom Archer deems as blind as a cave-fish, boldly challenges Archer to tell the truth. This is a perfect opportunity for him to admit his feelings for Ellen. But Archer fails to match her courage and does not admit to loving another. He is helped in his deception by her mistaken assumption that her rival is the married woman in Archer's past, Mrs Rushworth. Relieved at having escaped interrogation about Ellen, he claims that he feels as May does about the pointlessness of convention, while rapidly retreating into it. He asks May once more to bring forward the wedding.
	Archer's subsequent attempt to back out of his marriage to May and be with Ellen comes too late. Ellen tells him that, in opposing her divorce, he has taught her to sacrifice her own wishes for the good of others. She cannot allow him to cause May and the family unhappiness in order to buy her own happiness. This turn of events is tragically ironic. Archer has denied his own views (that Ellen should be free) and dutifully parroted the family's view that she must not bring scandal on the family through divorce. He has taught Ellen to deny her own fulfillment and his.
	During his visit to Ellen, his fate is sealed by May's telegram announcing the bringing forward of the wedding date. Archer responds with terrible ironic laughter. We shall see this response again, and in each case it comes at a time when fate delivers him a package which, by conforming to convention, he has enabled society to prepare for him.

Summary
	Under the eyes of New York society, Archer marries May in a kind of daze, while thinking of Ellen. Mrs Manson Mingott is unable to attend, being too large to fit into the church. Her family are relieved, since they find her appearance embarrassing. Also absent is Ellen, who has gone to Washington with Medora. Ellen has written to May saying that neither of them is well enough to make the journey. Medora, however, does turn up.
	Since her moment of awareness in St Augustine, when she offered to give Archer up, May has regressed to her previous state of inexpressiveness, and Archer finds himself looking at her as a stranger might.
	Archer and May leave for their honeymoon. Mr van der Luyden arranges for them to stay at the Patroon's house, where Archer and Ellen had a poignant encounter. Then the couple travel to Europe. May worries that she is expected to visit the Archer family's foreign acquaintances. Such is New York society's fear of Europeans that people like May travel abroad in a state of isolation. Though travel is a particular interest of Archer's, May sees it only as an opportunity for pursuing her love of sports. Archer has given up on the idea of emancipating his wife, ""who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free."" But he admires her devotion, loyalty, and fineness of feeling for him. He plans to sustain his artistic and intellectual life outside the domestic circle.
	In London, Archer and May visit two old friends of Mrs Archer's. They introduce him to a Frenchman who acts as the family's tutor, called M. Riviere. Archer and the cultured Riviere get along well. Though as poor as Ned Winsett, Riviere has lived a rich life, surrounded by literary geniuses and men of ideas. Riviere gave up journalism because it compromised his independence, and has worked as a private secretary and tutor. He asks Archer if there might be a job for him in America, but Archer feels that in that country, his gifts would hinder his success.
	Archer tells May that he would like to invite Riviere to dinner, but she only laughs and dismisses the tutor as common. Archer fears that this is how disagreements between them will be solved in future.
	Archer and May have settled into the newly built greenish-yellow house with the Pompeian vestibule, which he had despised. He has, however, arranged his library to his own taste, to the disapproval of the family. Archer wants to take May on holiday to a cottage on an island off the coast of Maine, but the Wellands always go to Newport, so that is where he ends up going.
	Married life for Archer has settled into a predictable routine. He has trained himself to view the ""momentary madness"" of his encounter with Ellen on the eve of his marriage as the last of a series of discarded amorous experiments. But his mind feels like an empty and echoing place.
	At the Beauforts' party in Newport, which hosts the annual archery competition, rumors are circulating about Beaufort. He has been seen with Fanny Ring, a woman of dubious repute (a prostitute or professional mistress, though this is not stated). He is also reported to be in financial trouble.
	Archer watches the archery competition, which May wins. Beaufort says contemptuously, ""that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit."" He is sneering at May's ""niceness."" Though Archer thinks this observation from a coarse man is proof of her quality, he worries: ""What if 'niceness' carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness?"" (Chapter 21, p. 180). He has never lifted that curtain.
	Archer and May call on Mrs Mingott on their way home from the party. Mrs Mingott reveals that Ellen is staying with her, though she has gone for a walk to the seashore. Mrs Mingott asks Archer to go and fetch her. Ellen now lives in Washington, and has proved a great attraction in Washington society.
	Archer walks to the shore and sees Ellen in the summer-house. The sight of her is like a dream; his reality now is the Wellands' world. He remembers the scene in the play, of the lover kissing the lady's ribbon without her knowing. He makes a bargain with himself: if she doesn't turn and look at him before the sail of a passing boat crosses a rock, he will go back without speaking to her. He waits, but she does not turn. He goes back to the house alone.
	May muses that perhaps Ellen does not care any more for her former friends. She spends much time with the Blenkers, whom May believes to be ""queer people."" She wonders if she wouldn't be happier with her husband. Archer is shocked by her cruel remark, and asks how anyone could be happier in hell.
	Back in his home, Archer feels a reversal of mood: where seeing Ellen had seemed like a dream, now that scene on the shore feels as real as the blood in his veins. It is the Welland atmosphere, with its minute observances, that affects his system like a narcotic. His life there seems unreal and irrelevant.
	Analysis
	Archer likens his wedding to the first night at the opera, another example of the performance metaphor that recurs in the novel. The effect is to draw attention to the unreality of the event: Archer, after all, loves another. The marriage between Archer and May, like most society marriages, is characterized by a mixture of mystery, fear, and awe, which in turn is sustained by things unacknowledged or unsaid. He has no idea what, if anything, lies behind the theatre curtain of May's ""niceness.""
	May's dismissal of the French tutor Riviere, whom Archer finds fascinating, as common, bodes ill for their marriage. Archer will have to keep what he considers his real life - his literary, artistic and travel interests - separate from his life with her. There is pathos in Archer's only visible victory in self-expression thus far in his marriage - his arrangement of his library to his own taste. Even this has earned disapproval from his family.

Summary
	Mr and Mrs Emerson Sillerton invite the Wellands to a party for the Blenkers. Mr Welland makes his excuses, but Mrs Welland decides that she will call in briefly, so that the Sillertons are not offended. Archer says he will drive to a stud farm to look for a second horse for May's carriage.
	Though Archer does call at the stud farm, he really wants to see the Blenkers' house because Ellen is living there. If he could carry away that vision, the rest of his world would seem less empty. He thinks that Ellen will be away from home, in Newport with the Blenkers, or visiting her grandmother, Mrs Mingott.
	He sees a pink parasol in the summer-house, and, believing it is Ellen's, heads towards it. But it belongs to one of the Blenker girls. Miss Blenker says that Ellen has been called away to Boston.
	Archer tells May that he has to go to Boston on business. He even uses a letter that arrives for him from the office to justify his plan - a deception which reminds him of the adulterer Lefferts's contrivances. In Boston the next day, he sees Ellen sitting on a bench on the common. She says she is here on business. She tells him that she has refused to take back money that belonged to her, because she could not agree to the conditions - to sit at the head of her husband's table occasionally. Count Olenski had not come himself, but had sent an emissary. Archer thinks this is the man with whom Ellen reportedly had the affair. The emissary is waiting till tonight before leaving, in case she changes her mind.
	Archer asks her to spend the day with him. She asks him why he did not come down to the beach to her when she was at Mrs Mingott's. He says, because she didn't look round at him. She says she did not look round on purpose and that she was trying to get as far away from Archer as she could. He tells her that he has come to Boston to see her. She goes back to her hotel to leave a note for the emissary, where Archer sees a man whose face he half-recognizes.
	Ellen joins Archer and tells him of her life in the one and a half years since they met. She had grown tired of New York society, feeling herself too different to care for the things it cared about. So she had settled in Washington, where there were supposed to be more varieties of people and opinions.
	Archer wonders why she does not go back to Europe. She says, because of him. She starts to tell Archer how he has changed her, but he interrupts her by saying how she has changed him: ""I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to."" She says that he has given up something he wanted (her) to save others (May) from disillusionment and misery; at least May is happy. If this was not a worthwhile sacrifice, then everything she has come to value in her ""new"" life is a sham.
	Archer savagely says that she gave him his first sight of real life, and at the same moment asked him to go on with a sham one. She bursts into tears, confessing that she is suffering just as he is. Archer feels overwhelmed by a sense of waste, chained as they are to their separate destinies. She promises him that she will not go back to Europe as long as they do not act on their love for each other.
	Analysis
	Ellen's comment to Archer that she finds Dr Carver's crazy social schemes more interesting than the blind conformity to tradition that she finds in New York society is revealing. As she points out, that tradition is not even America's own - it is borrowed from the old European countries from which the settlers came: ""It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country.""
	The tragic element of the novel reaches its apotheosis in the scene between Archer and Ellen in Boston. He realizes that if he acts on his love for her, he will drive her away, so much has she taken to heart his previous arguments that it is wrong to buy one's happiness at another's expense. She will stay only if he and she are not together. The individual has been sacrificed at the altar of the family and society.
	However, Wharton undermines Archer's tragic status by comparing his easy deception of May in visiting Boston to the contrivances of the adulterer Lefferts. Are they different? If we saw events from Lefferts's point of view instead of Archer's, would we sympathize with him as much? Wharton creates some sympathy for Archer by distinguishing his feelings for Ellen from his more superficial feelings for May. While he had been awed by May's physical beauty, he feels a ""curious indifference to [Ellen's] bodily presence""; his connection with Ellen is more intellectual and emotional.
	We learn that Ellen knew Archer was at the beach when he was asked to fetch her by Mrs Mingott. Archer had put their failure to speak to each other down to the fate that caused her not to turn round and see him. But in fact, both consciously chose not to speak; the responsibility for their not meeting lies with them, and not chance or fate.

Summary
	As he leaves Boston, Archer feels tranquil, even though he has no promise of further opportunities to see Ellen. She has held a perfect balance between their loyalty to others and honesty to themselves. He is glad that he did not tempt her. She will go back to Europe only if she feels she is becoming a temptation to Archer; she will stay near him as long as he does not ask her to come nearer.
	Back in New York at the railway station, he recognizes the man he saw coming out of the Boston hotel. It is M. Riviere. Riviere tells him that he has been sent here on a special mission and that he wishes to consult him about it. He is Count Olenski's emissary to Ellen. He has failed to persuade Ellen to fall in with the Count's wishes. He considers that his mission on behalf of the Count is over.
	Riviere begs Archer to persuade her family that it is a bad idea for her to go back to her husband. He has had talks with several members of Ellen's family, all of whom want Ellen to go back to her husband. Archer suddenly knows why he has been excluded from these discussions: some tribal instinct has told the family that he is no longer on their side. He realizes that May's remark that perhaps Ellen would be happier with her husband had been held up deliberately as a straw in the wind. She had reported his angry response to the family, and they had thereafter left him out of their counsels.
	Riviere had carried out his mission from the Count in good faith, as he had believed at first that it would be better for her to go back. But after he had listened to her and seen the change in her since she had been in America, he had changed his mind. Riviere says he used to see her in her husband's house, as he knew the Count. This leads Archer to wonder if Riviere is the secretary who helped Ellen escape and with whom she lived for a year. Riviere says that the Count's wish to have her back is not simply, as her relatives think, a longing for domestic life. Archer thanks him.
	Rumors continue to circulate about Beaufort's shady business dealings. Though society tolerates hypocrisy in private relations, it exacts an impeccable honesty in business dealings. If there is any truth in the rumors, nothing will save Regina Beaufort from social disgrace, even the fact that she is of the pre-eminent Dallas family. However, Beaufort is asking influential people to tide him over.
	Every year, Archer's mother complains that the customs of New York society are changing for the worse. Dress has become more extravagant and amusement is pursued for its own sake. Mrs Struthers has become acceptable, and even May goes to her parties, though Mrs Archer has not quite forgiven Ellen for being the first to accept Mrs Struthers. The family has taken to discussing Ellen in a deprecating tone, since she refused to go back to her husband. The Welland-Mingotts had ""let poor Ellen find her own level,"" which had been with people like the Blenkers and ""people who wrote.""
	May blushes when Ellen is mentioned. Archer wonders what this can mean. He has not seen Ellen for four months, since the day in Boston. She has returned to Washington. She has become part of his secret life of unexpressed thoughts and longings.
	At the Archers' house, Sillerton Jackson says it is a pity that Ellen refused her husband's offer. What will she live on, now that Beaufort looks set to be ruined? Archer is furious at the implication of adultery. Sillerton says that Mrs Mingott has told him that the family reduced Ellen's allowance when she refused to go back to her husband. By this refusal, she also forfeited the money settled on her when she married, which Olenski was prepared to make over to her if she returned.
	Archer says he knows nothing of her finances, but he objects to Sillerton's insinuation that Ellen was kept by Beaufort. Sillerton protests that he doesn't say this, but Lefferts does. Archer points out contemptuously that Lefferts courted Ellen and got snubbed. Sillerton reflects that it is a pity that Ellen has not gone back before, since if Beaufort is ruined and she goes back now, it will confirm that she has been kept by Beaufort. Archer is sure that she will not go back. But Sillerton points out that Medora's small remaining funds are in Beaufort's hands.
	Archer is angry because Sillerton now knows that Archer knew nothing of Ellen's differences with the family. Sillerton will have concluded that Archer was left out of the family confidences because they think (wrongly) that he and Ellen are lovers.
	Archer despairs at the prospect of endless years with May. He tells her he may have to go to Washington on business, regarding a patent case before the Supreme Court. She agrees, and reminds him to go and see Ellen. Her comment is a coded message. It tells Archer that she knows that he has broken with the family policy and advised Ellen not to go back to her husband. She knows too that he will see Ellen in Washington.
	Archer hears that the lawsuit that will provide his cover story for going to Washington has been postponed. Archer does not intend to put off his visit, however, as May will probably not hear about the lawsuit.
	Rumors circulate that Beaufort will be helped through his troubles by powerful influences.
	Mr Letterblair tells Archer that Beaufort had not been ""tided over""; but had put out a rumor that he had been, thereby keeping money flowing into his bank. But the disturbing rumors had arisen once more, and people had started pulling their money out of the bank. This would ruin Beaufort. By his dishonest behavior in continuing to accept funds after he knew his bank would fail, Beaufort has added to his disgrace. Mr Letterblair worries about the effects on Archer's family, as they are relations.
	Archer receives a message from May asking him to come to see Mrs Mingott, who has had a stroke. She had heard about Beaufort's troubles from Regina Beaufort, who had visited her to ask the family to back them financially. Mrs Mingott had refused, but the shock of being asked to do such a dishonorable thing brought on the stroke.
	Mrs Mingott asks to see Ellen. May says that it is a pity that Ellen's train to New York will cross Archer's train bound for Washington on the way.
	Analysis
	Though New York society considers itself the height of sophistication, Wharton portrays it as primitive and tribal. Some tribal instinct has told the Welland-Mingott family that in the matter of Ellen, Archer is not on their side. Hence he has been left out of discussions that concluded that Ellen should go back to her husband.
	The fact that Rivi�re is able to enlist Archer to argue against Ellen's returning to her husband when he was previously enlisted by the family to argue that she should not divorce him confirms that Archer has never been perceived as his own person. In the battle for Ellen's mores, he is used first as a champion by society, then as the voice of Ellen's individual interests.
	Wharton's narrator is not omniscient, and there is much that we are not told and about which we can form our own judgments. We are not told whether Ellen and the secretary were lovers, or what the relationship is between Ellen and Beaufort, or how much May knows about her husband's feelings for Ellen. This creates in us an insecurity similar to that felt by the characters. For example, we must guess what people know about Archer's secret life, just as he must guess, and thus we are given a sense of his alienation from society.
	Archer's unsuccessful attempts to conform to society's demands have led him to set up a parallel life made up of his hidden desires, longings and thoughts. Ellen has become part of Archer's 'real' but secret life, where he brings the books he reads, and the ideas he has. Outside this world, ""in the scene of his actual life, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency, blunder against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room"" (Chapter 26, p. 224).
	It is clear from the coded, unspoken message that May gives to Archer in Chapter 26 that she knows he has broken ranks with her family and advised Ellen not to return to her husband. In true tribal fashion, May is in solidarity with her family on this issue; indeed, Archer knows from talking with Riviere that she deliberately sounded him out on the issue before reporting his traitorous conduct to her family. In the long unspoken dialogue, Wharton also implies that May knows more than she admits about Archer's feelings for Ellen. It would not be proper for May to say anything explicitly to Archer about this, so she pretends she is unaware of it.
	There is a sinister undertone to these episodes between May and Archer, in which nothing is explicitly said but everything is understood. Their marriage is a sort of triangular cold war with May, Archer and Ellen at its center, and May's family and society as the troops. It is not based on trust and friendship, but on mistrust, espionage, secret strategy meetings, coded messages, and exclusion of traitors.

Summary
	Archer sends a telegram to Ellen asking her to come to visit Mrs Mingott.
	News emerges that Beaufort is ruined, taking much of the money of New York's ruling clans down with him. It is the worse case of dishonor in memory. Mrs Beaufort too is disgraced, largely because of her seemingly cynical efforts to persuade others to bale her husband out. Mrs Archer feels that the Beauforts should retire quietly to the Regina's family's house in North Carolina to breed horses.
	The Archers receive a telegram from Ellen saying that she will arrive the following day. The Welland-Mingott family members find excuses why they cannot meet her at the station, so Archer offers to fetch her. Later, May asks him how he can meet Ellen when he is going to Washington for the court case. He tells her he is not going as the case is postponed. But May has seen a note saying that Mr Letterblair is going. Archer rapidly changes his story: Letterblair is going, so he will not. May asks whether the case is not postponed after all. Archer blushes and says it is not, but his going is. May pretends that she does not know he is lying.
	Archer collects Ellen from the railway station. He is surprised to realize that he barely remembers what she looks like. She asks if the carriage is May's. As if in retaliation for her reference to May, he tells her that M. Rivi�re has been to see him. He asks her whether it was Rivi�re who helped her get away from her husband. She says it was, but gives no clue as to the nature of their relationship. He tells her that she is an honest person who sees things as they are. She replies that she has had to, for she has looked at the Gorgon. In Greek mythology, the Gorgon was a monster so horrible that she was believed to blind those who looked at her. But contrary to legend, Ellen says, the Gorgon does not blind one, but dries up one's tears. The implication is that Ellen's experience has taught her to be realistic, not sentimental.
	They kiss. Archer says that he does not want a secretive love affair. He has a vision of their being together. Ellen laughs harshly. She asks him if he wants her to live with him as his mistress. He says he wants them to get away to a place where such words do not exist. Gently, she asks, ""Oh, my dear - where is that country? Have you ever been there?"" She has known many who have tried to find it, and settled for various European cities, which turned out to be no different from the places they'd left. She says they have no future together, apart from a tawdry one of trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them. There can be no escape from the judgments of others.
	Archer, angry and hurt, gets out of the carriage before they get to Mrs Mingott's.
	At home, May reports that the Mrs Mingott is improving and that the Beauforts intend to stay in New York. Archer is bored by their relationship and worries that she is turning into a copy of her mother. Feeling stifled, he opens the window. May asks him to shut it, as he will ""catch his death,"" and her words prompt him to a morbid wish that she would die and set him free.
	A week later, Mrs Mingott tells Archer that Ellen has agreed to come and live with her. She says that the family persuaded her to cut Ellen's allowance in order to make her go back to her husband. Olenski's secretary had put the Count's proposals to her, and she had agreed that they were favorable. But when she had seen Ellen again, she could not bear the thought of her being shut up in the cage of her marriage once more, and had asked her to come and nurse her instead. She has also restored Ellen's allowance.
	Archer is delighted, believing that Ellen has agreed to this proposal because she cannot give him up. Mrs Manson Mingott warns Archer that the family does not agree with her plan, and she asks him to back her up. Archer agrees. He asks if he can see Ellen, but she has gone to visit Regina Beaufort, to support her in her unhappy situation.
	Analysis
	New York society's treatment of the Beauforts shows its hypocrisy. It had always been known that Beaufort had indulged in shady dealings, but had been prepared to overlook this as long as the appearance of propriety was maintained. Indeed, people enjoyed Beaufort's private ballroom and went to his parties. But when his illicit dealings reached such heights as to become the subject of public gossip, society cut him and his wife off. It is felt that they should simply leave New York and live quietly somewhere else - as if not having the sinner under one's eyes made the sin vanish. Appearance is seen as more important than reality.
	May continues to pretend that she does not know about Archer's feelings for Ellen, when she clearly does know something. She would rather keep up the act of a happy marriage and deny the reality. Watching her attempts to hide what she knows pains Archer, and he feels pity for her.
	Archer, like May, is living in an illusory world. He imagines that he and Ellen can live somewhere apart from society's adverse judgments. Ellen is more realistic, and knows that there is no such place.

Summary
	Archer is stunned at Mrs Mingott's news. He feels that Ellen, frightened at the prospect of his making a decisive step from which there would be no possibility of return, has decided to compromise and have an affair with him. He worries that an affair might draw them into a life of lies and deceptions, and is concerned about how he will be perceived by society.
	He waits near Beaufort's house for Ellen. When she comes out, he grasps her hand and tells her that they will be together. He notices Lefferts and Chivers discreetly avoiding them, and is sickened by the thought that this could be their future. They arrange to meet the next day at the Metropolitan Museum.
	In the museum, Ellen tells Archer that she has decided to stay with Mrs Mingott because she feels she will be safer from temptation. She does not want to do irreparable harm, as others do in such situations. Archer protests that he is no different from the others; he has the same longings. She wavers, and asks if she should come once to him and then leave New York and go back to her husband. Archer does not believe they can give up their current lives. He miserably agrees that she will come to him the day after tomorrow.
	At home, May tells Archer that she has seen Ellen and had a long talk with her. She has decided that she has judged her too harshly and that she is fond of her despite her tendency to take up odd people. But she remarks that she has alienated the van der Luydens by going to visit the disgraced Regina Beaufort.
	The following evening, at the van der Luydens' pre-opera dinner, the topic of discussion is the Beauforts' ruin. Mrs van der Luyden asks May if it is true that Mrs Manson Mingott's carriage was outside Mrs Beaufort's door, an action they consider improper, given the Beauforts' disgrace.
	Archer and May go to the opera. May is dressed in her wedding dress, a common custom during the first year or so of marriage. Moved by the memory of her generosity when she told him she did not want her happiness to be made out of another's misery, he feels inspired to tell her the truth about Ellen, and ask for his freedom.
	At home, he begins to confess about himself and Ellen, but May stops him, saying that none of this matters now that ""it's all over"": Ellen is returning to Europe to live with Medora.
	Archer laughs bitterly, and goes to bed.
	May tells Archer that she wants to hold their first big dinner party, in honor of Ellen, who is leaving for Europe. Ellen is not, however, returning to her husband, and Archer thinks there is nothing to prevent him following her. His confidence in their future together has enabled him to restrain himself from contacting her. Mrs Mingott has given Ellen a generous trust fund.
	Ellen arrives at the Archers' dinner party, looking pale and almost ugly, though Archer thinks that he has never loved her more than at that moment. The guests are all kind to Ellen, now that she is leaving and will no longer pose a threat to their conventions. Suddenly, he realizes that everyone there thinks that he and Ellen are lovers. He now sees the dinner guests as conspirators in an elaborate ritual to mark the expulsion from the tribe of a member who has transgressed its code. He catches May's triumphant eyes; in the secret war between her and Ellen over Archer, she is the victor.
	As Archer bids Ellen goodbye, he says he will see her in Paris. She replies pointedly that he and May will be welcome. Lefferts catches him by the sleeve, asking him to cover for an illicit rendezvous.
	After their guests have left, Archer tries to tell May once more of his feelings for Ellen. He begins by saying that he wants to go away on a long trip. May says that he must take her with him, because she is pregnant. She is now sure, though she suspected it two weeks ago, and pretended to Ellen even then that she was sure.
	Analysis
	Faced with the prospect of an affair with Ellen, Archer is concerned about how this would appear to society. Contrary to his earlier belief that men who have illicit love affairs are seen as foolish, whereas women who do so are seen as criminal, he is now convinced that the men are judged more harshly than the women. Archer's fears about how such things are perceived are confirmed by the dinner party scene in Chapter 33. The guests assume, wrongly, that Archer has been unfaithful to May, and rally around her.
	Ellen's observation about the exhibits from dead cultures in the museum - that eventually, everything that seems important ceases to matter and ends up with a label saying, ""Use unknown"" - has immense resonance. The customs and traditions of New York society that circumscribe Archer's and Ellen's lives will one day be forgotten and irrelevant. Though The Age of Innocence is set in the 1870s, Wharton wrote it after World War I and published it in 1920, when the society portrayed in it was already defunct. It is the more tragic, then, that Archer's and Ellen's heartfelt desires are sacrificed to mores that have no more permanent value than obscure items in a glass case.
	The scene at the opera echoes the opening scene of the novel. On the face of it, little has changed. But there are important and revealing differences. Then, he was impatient to bring forward the announcement of his engagement to May; now, he is equally eager to dissolve their union. Then, his aim was to protect the honor of the family of his wife-to-be; now, he has less respect for convention and wants to pursue his illicit relationship with Ellen. May's tearing and soiling her wedding dress as she gets out of the carriage after the opera is symbolic of their decayed marriage.
	He is on the verge of confessing to May his love for Ellen when she tells him that Ellen is leaving for Europe. Once again, Archer is prevented from pursuing his love for Ellen, and responds with bitter laughter. (The first time was in Chapter 18.) However, these events are not the workings of a cruel fate. Both events have been prompted by Archer's own actions: the first time, by his persistent requests to May's family to bring forward his marriage; and the second, by his reckless decision to push his affair with Ellen into action, and also by his pursuance of family life with May to the point of starting a family. It is later revealed that May too has played a calculating part in Ellen's decision, challenging her husband's view of her as passive and unaware.
	The Archers' dinner party in honor of Ellen's departure is perhaps the most bitterly ironic scene in the novel. At last, New York society is behaving generously towards Ellen - but Archer realizes it is only because they are celebrating the expulsion from the tribe of a person who has transgressed their code. He also realizes the reason why it is essential, from their point of view, that she goes: they believe that Archer and Ellen are lovers. The deepest irony lies in the fact that this is the one thing that they have been unable to be. We are left to wonder whether, had they given in to temptation, they would have been any worse off. Has their sacrifice been for nothing?
	Archer feels ""like a prisoner in the center of an armed camp"" (Chapter 33, p. 286), reinforcing the sense that Wharton creates of a war between the individual and society. Prompted by this feeling of imprisonment, Archer announces loudly that he intends to travel soon. Later, he catches May's triumphant eyes and knows that she is the victor in an unspoken war with Ellen, with Archer as the prize.
	After the dinner party, Archer makes one more effort to tell May of his feelings for Ellen and break free. He is foiled once again, by her revelation that she is pregnant. Though she was not sure two weeks before, when she had her long talk with Ellen, she told Ellen that she was. This, Archer now knows, was what prompted Ellen not to follow through on the affair with Archer and to go instead to Europe. Faced with a pregnant wife, a mistress has no rights. As May tells Archer her news, her eyes are wet with victory - again, a war metaphor. May, far from the dull-minded innocent that Archer has believed her to be, has revealed herself to be a calculating opponent who glories in her triumph over her rival, Ellen.

The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapter 34,"Chapter 34
Summary
	It is twenty-five years after the Archers' dinner party for Ellen. Archer is reflecting about the past in his library. Their eldest son, Dallas, had been born, followed by Mary, who has married a son of Reggie Chivers, and their youngest, Bill. Dallas is artistic and is training to be an architect. Archer is known as a model citizen of New York and a philanthropist, and has made a foray into politics. He was a dutiful husband to May until she died of pneumonia, and had honestly mourned her death. He feels that he has missed out on ""the flower of life"" (p. 296), but now thinks of Ellen only as one might think of an imaginary beloved in a book or picture, as a symbol of all he has missed.
	May died believing the world to be a good place, full of harmonious and loving households like her own. But she was unaware that things had changed around her, and even her own children had concealed their views from her, just as Archer did his.
	There is little left of the restrictive old New York, to the extent that Lefferts's sneering prophecy of years before that if things went on at this rate, their children would be marrying Beaufort's bastards, has come true. Dallas is marrying Fanny Beaufort, and no one objects. After his wife's death, Beaufort had married Fanny Ring, and had gone to live abroad. Young Fanny is the offspring of their union.
	People now are too busy with reforms and fads to worry about what their neighbors are up to. Young people take it for granted that they will have what they want, whereas Archer's generation took it for granted that they wouldn't.
	Dallas persuades his father to accompany him to Europe. In Paris, Dallas arranges for them both to visit Ellen. Dallas asks his father whether Ellen wasn't the woman he would have given up everything for - but didn't. The son says that the day before May died, she told Dallas that she knew the children would be safe with Archer, ""because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you most wanted."" (p. 304). Archer, moved that May had guessed his feelings and pitied him, replies that she never asked him.
	Archer does not go with his son to visit Ellen. More than half a lifetime divided them, and he has no idea how she may have changed or whether she is living with someone. He asks his son to tell Ellen only that Archer is old-fashioned. He sits on a bench and looks up at her balcony, and thinks, ""It's more real to me here than if I went up"" (p. 308). A manservant comes out onto the balcony and closes the shutters, and Archer walks back alone to his hotel.
	Analysis
	Wharton breaks with the tradition of romantic novels in her inconclusive ending. There is nothing to prevent Archer and Ellen from being reunited; even society has moved on from the restrictions that had previously bound them. If they were reunited, they would either find that they had changed too much and had nothing in common, or they would at last be together. But neither resolution occurs. The reader is likely to feel frustrated and dissatisfied, exactly as Archer and Ellen have felt over their unconsummated affair.
	Critics have given different interpretations of why Archer refuses to go up and see Ellen. Some see it as a brave and wise decision; others as cowardice. Wharton tells us that Archer would rather hold on to the memory of Ellen than have 'real life' impinge on his own reality and, perhaps, destroy it. But the effect of the ending is to cast an extremely ironic light on what has gone before. Archer has struggled and fought against the societal restrictions that disapproved of his union with Ellen - though never resolutely enough to break through them utterly. Now, those restrictions have melted away, yet Archer still cannot reach out and embrace the love that has dominated his life throughout the novel. It is clear that the prison was not so much an objective reality as a creation of the minds of society people like Archer. It is like an agreement between the members of a club. Archer has imprisoned himself, and continues to do so, rather like a guinea pig who is so used to living in a cage that he will not leave it even when the door is left open. His half-hearted attempts to escape showed an irresolution that measured poorly against even May's single-minded determination to preserve her marriage against the incursion of Ellen.

Mr. Bennet's preference for his daughter Elizabeth also becomes evident, when he says she ""has something more of quickness than her sisters,"" whom he describes as ""silly and ignorant like other girls."" Mr. Bennet teasingly questions why his visit to Bingley could be so important.
	Chapter 2: Elizabeth, as well as three of her four sisters, Kitty, Mary, and Lydia are briefly introduced in chapter two.  While in Chapter one Mr. Bennet teases his wife saying he will not visit Bingley as soon as he arrives, in Chapter two we learn that indeed ""Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley."" ""The rest of the evening is spent in conjecturing how soon [Bingley] will return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner.""
	Chapter 3: Bingley is invited to dinner when he returns Mr. Bennet's visit, but declines the offer, as he must go to town on business.  He returns in time for a ball at Sir William and Lady Lucas' (neighbors of the Bennet's), and brings his sisters and his friend, Mr. Darcy.  While all agree at first that Mr. Darcy is a good looking, rich man, soon he is thought to be proud, and all are disgusted by him. He says of Elizabeth, ""She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me."" Jane, the eldest of the Bennet's daughters dances with Bingley twice, and that joy is enough to make Mrs. Bennet ""quite delighted"" with him. 
	Chapter 4: When Jane and Elizabeth are alone, Jane admits how much she admires Bingley, and that she finds his sisters, Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, charming.  Elizabeth however, wonders at how her sister never finds fault with anybody, and how she can be ""so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others."" Elizabeth does not find Bingley's sisters charming, but rather proud and conceited. It is told that Bingley inherited money from his father, and that his sisters are anxious for him to have an estate of his own.  Miss Bingley is going to live at Netherfield with Bingley, and despite the differences between Bingley and Darcy, theirs is a ""very steady friendship,"" and Bingley thinks very highly of Darcy's judgement and regard.

Elizabeth is then taken by surprise by Darcy, and before she realizes it, has agreed to dance the next two dances with him.  Elizabeth tries to talk to Darcy during the dancing, as she knows that he would prefer not too, and when the conversation turns to Wickham, Darcy again changes color.  He says that while Wickham is good at making friends, he is not good at keeping them.  Sir William then dances near the couple, and Darcy gets quite serious when Sir William makes an allusion to how congratulations may soon be in order for Bingley and Jane. Elizabeth is later embarrassed by her family's conduct, when her mother openly discusses the relationship between Bingley and Jane (in front of Darcy) and when Mary sings badly.  The Bennet family is the last to leave, and it is clear that the Bingley sisters wish they would go, and Bingley and Jane are again alone talking away from the group.
	Chapter 19: The next day Mr. Collins finds Mrs. Bennet, Kitty and Elizabeth in the drawing room, and asks for some time alone with Elizabeth.  Elizabeth anxiously asks the others not to leave, knowing what is coming, but then decides it is better to get it over with.  After Collins gives Elizabeth his reasons for wanting to marry, including that Lady Catherine advised it, he asks Elizabeth to marry him.  Elizabeth states that it is impossible for her to accept, as they would not make each other happy.  Collins, though, is not disappointed, as he believes that she is only declining in order to be modest and that he will only have to wait a bit and ask again.  No matter how much Elizabeth says that she will never accept, Collins believes that she eventually will. 
	Chapter 20: Collins tells Mrs. Bennet that he is not concerned about Elizabeth's refusal, but Mrs. Bennet is.  She calls on Mr. Bennet to speak to Elizabeth and talk her into marrying Collins.  When Mrs. Bennet tells Elizabeth that she will never see her again if she refuses Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet says that he will never see her again if she accepts.  Elizabeth continues to refuse.  Charlotte Lucas soon comes for a visit, is told the news, and gets to know Mr. Collins.

Elizabeth writes to Mrs. Gardiner's queries about Wickham that Wickham has found another to admire, a woman that has some money, unlike Elizabeth.

	Chapter 30: Sir William returns home when he sees that his daughter is comfortably settled with her husband.  Now and then Lady Catherine comes to visit and advise Charlotte on how to do things differently at her house.  The party dines at Rosings about twice a week, and a few weeks later Darcy comes to visit.  He brings with him his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.  Darcy soon comes to visit at the Collins', and Elizabeth asks him how it happened that her sister Jane could be in London for three months and he never happened to see her there.  He looks confused at the question and says that he had not had the fortune to meet her there, and pursues the subject no more.
	Chapter 31: Since the arrival of Darcy and Fitzwilliam, the party at the parish had been little invited to Rosings.  When they are finally invited, Lady Catherine makes it ""plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else."" During this visit, Darcy is curious to see how well Elizabeth and Fitzwilliam are getting along, and when Elizabeth plays the piano, he moves his chair to be closer to her in order to converse.  Elizabeth notices that Darcy does not seem to show any love for Miss De Bourgh who he is supposedly to marry, and thinks that he could just as likely marry Miss Bingley, whom he also shows no preference for although she desires his affection.
	Chapter 32: The next morning Elizabeth is sitting by herself and is surprised by a visit from Darcy, who explains that he did not know she was alone. In their embarrassed state, Elizabeth asks Darcy if Mr. Bingley is planning on ever returning to Netherfield, and Darcy says that he would not be surprised if Bingley gave up the house.  When Charlotte and her sister return, Darcy excuses himself.

Pride and Prejudice: Novel Summary: Chapters 33-36,"Chapter 33: More than once Elizabeth has unexpectedly met Mr. Darcy in the park.  She has told him that she often walks there, so she does not understand why he continues to go there.  While she is walking this time though, she meets Colonel Fitzwilliam.  They begin to walk and converse, and when the subject of Miss Darcy arises, Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth that he is joined in the guardianship of her with Darcy.  When Elizabeth asks if such a young lady is difficult to manage, Fitzwilliam looks at her earnestly, and Elizabeth thinks that she had somehow got near the truth.  The conversation turns to Darcy's friendship with Bingley, and Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth that it seems that Bingley is in debt to Darcy for getting him out of an imprudent marriage.  While he says that he is not sure it is Bingley, he says that he understands that there were ""some very strong objections against the lady,"" and Darcy congratulates himself on getting Bingley away from her.  Elizabeth is quite sure that Fitzwilliam is speaking of Jane and Bingley, as she cannot believe that Darcy could have so much influence over two men.  When she is again at home, her agitation and tears bring on a headache, and she does not join the others for a visit to Lady Catherine's.
	Chapter 34: Elizabeth is surprised by a visit from Darcy while the others are at Lady Catherine's.  Darcy shocks Elizabeth by telling her that he admires and loves her and wishes her to marry him.  He speaks of how he has tried to fight his love for her because of her and her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth can see that he has no doubt that she will accept his hand.  He is quite amazed when instead she does not accept, and says that she is not only offended by the speech he has just made, but that she has other reasons for declining his offer, such as how he had treated Jane and Wickham.  Darcy admits to separating Bingley and Jane and rejoicing in his success at it, and he speaks with contempt of Wickham.  Darcy angrily accuses Elizabeth of not being able to overlook these offenses because her pride was hurt by his speech about her family's inferiority, and Elizabeth states that the only thing those declarations did was spare her any concern she may have in refusing him.  He is astonished when she says that he ""could not have made [her] the offer of [his] hand in any possible way that would have tempted [her] to accept."" Darcy asks Elizabeth to accept his best wishes for her health and happiness and quickly leaves the house.
	Chapter 35: The next day Elizabeth cannot think of anything else but what had happened the night before.  She decides to take a walk, and when she hears Darcy calling her, she tries to avoid him.  When he catches up to her, he gives her a letter, asking her to read it.  The letter starts by saying that Elizabeth need not worry about him trying to renew any of his offers, but that he feels that he should explain the circumstances around the two accusations she made against him. 
	In reference to his talking Bingley into leaving Netherfield, he states that he had seen Bingley in love many times before, and that he did not realize how serious this relationship was until the ball when he heard Sir William and others speaking of how they expected a marriage.  He then observed Bingley and Jane closer, and while he saw that Bingley was clearly affected by Jane, he thought Jane seemed more indifferent to Bingley.  When he explained his concerns about the inferiority of Jane's family to him, Bingley was not willing to give her up, but when Darcy told him that he felt Jane indifferent, Bingley agreed to leave.
	With respect to Wickham, Darcy also explains.  He writes that his father indeed had the highest opinion of him, but that after his death Wickham received an agreed upon sum, and when it was gone, came back for more to support his ""life of idleness and dissipation."" Darcy would not give him more money, and did not hear from him a while, until he found out from his sister that she felt herself in love with him.  Darcy arrived in time to stop the elopement.  Darcy concludes his letter by hoping that she will acquit him of any cruelty towards Wickham, and that if she needs any proof of the truth of what he had written, she could talk to Colonel Fitzwilliam.
	Chapter 36: Elizabeth reads through Darcy's letter with a mixture of emotions.  When she first reads Darcy's explanation of his conduct with Bingley and Jane, she dismisses his explanation of his concern about Jane's indifference as false, and believes he acted solely because of her family.  However, when she begins reading his explanation of the dealings with Wickham, she begins to read more clearly.  She soon begins to realize that she had not known anything of Wickham before the night when he told her of he and Darcy, and she wonders why she didn't realize his impropriety at speaking of such things to a stranger.  As she continues to reread and think, she realizes that she had been ""blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd,"" and that she believes Darcy's version of what happened.  She then rereads the section about Jane and Bingley, and sees that she cannot deny the justice of his description of Jane's seeming indifference after all.  After two hours of wandering in the park she returns home to be told that both Fitzwilliam and Darcy had come to say their good-byes.

	Chapter 40: Elizabeth can no longer wait to tell Jane of what had happened with Darcy, so she concludes to suppress any part of the story that concerns her.  Jane is all astonishment, and feels sorry for the sadness that Elizabeth's refusal must have given Darcy.  Elizabeth then relates the parts of the letter that refer to Wickham, and Jane is shocked that Wickham could have been so very bad.  The two discuss whether they should tell anyone else of Wickham's behavior, but decided against it since his regiment is leaving Meryton soon anyway.  Elizabeth feels that she should not relate any of the news of Bingley and how he did indeed care for her, although she notices that Jane is not happy and still has a tender affection for Bingley.

	Chapter 42: Now that the regiment has left, there is little to do for Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, and their complaints make Elizabeth wish that her trip with the Gardiner's would soon arrive; however, Mrs. Gardiner writes that it will have to be put off another two weeks, and that instead of going to the Lakes as planned, they will have to shorten their trip and travel to Derbyshire.  At the mention of Derbyshire, Elizabeth thinks of Darcy, and his estate there, Pemberley.  When the Gardiner's do finally arrive they leave their children in the care of Jane, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth leave for their trip.  Mrs. Gardiner expresses a wish to see Pemberley again, and thinks that Jane will want to see the place she has heard so much about.  Elizabeth is distressed that she might meet Darcy while walking the grounds until she learns from the hotel chambermaid that the family is not there for the summer.

	Chapter 50: Mr. Bennet is sorry that he did not save more during his lifetime to provide for his daughters.  He and Mrs. Bennet had always assumed that they would have a son and that their property would not be entailed away.  However, Bennet is determined to find out how much money his brother-in-law put forward to help Lydia and pay him back.  He sends a letter to Gardiner accepting the terms of Wickham and asking him how much he is indebted to him.  Mrs. Bennet comes downstairs (after staying in her room distressed while Lydia was missing) to plan the wedding and the future of her daughter.  Mr. Bennet amazes her by saying that Lydia and Wickham will not be welcome in their house, and that he will not advance any money to buy his daughter wedding clothes. 
	Elizabeth is sorry that she had told Darcy of the matter with her sister.  While she is not afraid that he will keep it secret, she fears that the behavior of her sister will make her and Jane and the rest of her family seem even more inferior in his eyes.  Now that it was not likely that she and Darcy should meet again, Elizabeth has convinced herself that she could be happy with him.  ""She began to comprehend that he was exactly the man, who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her."" Mr. Bennet receives a return letter from Mr. Gardiner assuring that he was happy to do what he could for his niece, and asking that the matter not be brought up again.  He also writes that Wickham intends to remove himself from the corps and go into the regulars, which are quartered in the North.  Jane and Elizabeth talk their father into changing his mind and accepting Lydia in their home, so it is decided that Wickham and Lydia will visit Longbourn after their wedding before they set off for the North.
	Chapter 51: After they are married, Lydia and Wickham come to Longbourn and are met with rapture by Mrs. Bennet.  Mr. Bennet is not quite so cordial, and Elizabeth and Jane are surprised by Lydia's lack of embarrassment.  Lydia goes on and on about how happy she is and what a wonderful marriage she has made, until Elizabeth can take no more and must leave the room.  Lydia says, ""I am sure my sisters must all envy me.  I only hope they may have half my good luck."" Lydia says that she will invite her sisters to the North for that purpose, but Elizabeth says, "" I thank you for my share of the favour, but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."" Even though Elizabeth had rather not hear about it, Lydia tells her about the events of her wedding day, including that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding.  Elizabeth is shocked at the mention of him, but Lydia will say no more, as she has remembered that she had promised him and Wickham not to say anything about his presence.  Elizabeth can of course think of nothing other than what he could be doing there, and sends off a letter to Mrs. Gardiner asking her about it.
	Chapter 52: Elizabeth receives a prompt reply from her aunt, from which she learns that Mr. Darcy had gone to London, found Lydia and Wickham, and reported to her uncle as soon as her father had left the city.  Her aunt also tells her that it is Darcy who has paid for Wickham to marry Lydia, but that he had wanted Mr. Gardiner to take the credit and for his part in the matter to be kept secret.  As explanation of his actions, Darcy states that he feels guilty for not exposing Wickham for what he was before a situation such as this occurred.  Elizabeth suspects that while this may have been his true motive, his affection for her may have also been part of it.

	Chapter 56: About a week after Jane and Bingley's engagement, Lady Catherine makes a surprise visit to Longbourn.  She asks Elizabeth to take a walk with her, and proceeds to tell her that she is alarmed by the rumors that she is to marry her nephew Darcy.  She insists on having the rumor contradicted, as she does not approve of the match because of the inferiority of Elizabeth's family.  Elizabeth talks around Lady Catherine's questions, and Lady Catherine finds her impertinent, and insists that she speak to her frankly.  Lady Catherine says that Darcy and her daughter are destined for each other, and demands to know if Elizabeth means to marry Darcy.  Elizabeth asks how she could be engaged to Darcy if he is engaged to Miss De Bourgh.  Lady Catherine gets increasingly irritated, and Elizabeth finally tells her that she is not engaged to Darcy.  Lady Catherine seems relieved by this, but when she asks Elizabeth to promise that she will never enter into such an engagement, Elizabeth refuses.  Lady Catherine leaves angrily, saying that she will continue to make sure that she and Darcy are not married.

Pride and Prejudice: Novel Summary: Chapters 57-60,"Chapter 57: When Lady Catherine is gone, Elizabeth thinks on the visit and wonders how such a rumor got started, concluding that people must have heard of the wedding of Bingley and Jane and desired another wedding between his friend and her sister.  She worries that Lady Catherine will indeed continue to make sure the match does not happen, and will talk to Darcy of the inferiority of her family, firmly resolving him against her.  The next morning Elizabeth's father meets her, wishing to discuss a letter he had received from Mr. Collins.  He is surprised to find out that Mr. Collins is congratulating him on the engagement of Jane, and on the future engagement of Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy.  He is shocked that Collins could receive such a report, and is amused that it should be about Darcy, someone whom he believes Elizabeth to despise.  Elizabeth is hurt by her father's amusement, and at the fact that he sees Mr. Darcy as indifferent to her.
	Chapter 58: Soon Darcy returns from London, and he and Bingley visit.  Jane, Elizabeth, Bingley, Darcy and Kitty go for a walk, but Elizabeth and Darcy are left alone when Jane and Bingley walk off and Kitty leaves to call on Maria.  Elizabeth tells Darcy that she knows of the help that Darcy gave to Lydia, and says that she is quite grateful.  Darcy is sorry that she had found out about it, but says that her family owes him nothing, as he only thought of her when he did it.  He tells her that his feelings for her are the same as they were when he proposed, but that he will speak of it no more if hers have not changed.  She asserts that her sentiments have undergone quite a change, and that she is happy that he feels the same.  Darcy tells her that his aunt's retelling of her conversation with Elizabeth had given him hope that her feelings for him had changed. Elizabeth apologizes for anything she said before that could have hurt him, but Darcy says that her reproofs were valuable, as they have helped him to change.  Darcy states that he is happy with the engagement of Jane and Bingley, and admits that he had told Bingley of his mistake about Jane's indifference, and had basically given Bingley permission to pursue the match.
	Chapter 59: Elizabeth and Darcy lose track of time with their walking and talking, but although the family notices their absence, they think nothing of it, as they do not believe anything could happen between the two.  Later in the evening Elizabeth tells Jane of what occurred between she and Darcy, and Jane is incredulous.  It takes a bit of convincing for Jane to finally believe that Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy had changed and for her to be happy for her.  The next day Mrs. Bennet makes more disparaging remarks when she sees Darcy coming, and makes Elizabeth walk out with him again so that the rest of the family does not have to be around him.  During their walk it is decided that Darcy will ask Mr. Bennet for his consent to his daughter's hand that evening. 
	When the evening arrives, and Darcy leaves from his conference with her father smiling, Elizabeth is somewhat relieved, but she is still nervous about disappointing her father with her choice of husband.  Mr. Bennet asks Elizabeth if she is out of her senses, as he thought that she had always hated the man.  As with Jane, it takes a bit of convincing to make her father see that she is indeed in love with Darcy, and he accepts the match.  She also tells her father of what Darcy had done for Lydia, and he is relieved that it was not his brother-in-law after all, as he knows that Darcy will not receive repayment from him.  That night Elizabeth follows her mother upstairs to tell her the news.  She is quite shocked, but then gets quite excited about how much money Elizabeth will have, and how she will have three daughters married.
	Chapter 60: Elizabeth asks Darcy if he only loves her because of her impertinence to him, and he states that it was the liveliness of her mind.  She asks why he was so quiet on the first days of his visit to Longbourn, and he states that he was embarrassed, but that he had to come to see if she had perhaps changed her mind about him.  Elizabeth writes a letter to Mrs. Gardiner telling her of the engagement, and Darcy writes one to Lady Catherine.  Bingley's sister congratulates her brother with affection and insincerity, and Miss Darcy is quite sincere in her happiness for her brother's engagement.  The Collinses come to visit, as Charlotte wants to get away from Lady Catherine's anger about the match that Charlotte is so happy about.

Hard Times: Summary: Book1Chapters 1-4,"Book the First: Sowing Chapters 1-4
	The first chapter of Hard Times takes place in a schoolroom. Mr. Gradgrind explains that children should be taught only facts. In the next chapter, he calls on Sissy Jupe to give him a definition of a horse. She cannot do so, but a boy in the class, Bitzer, defines a horse to the satisfaction of Gradgrind. Another of the adults in the room, a government officer, now takes over the teaching. He asks the girls and boys whether they would paper a room with representations of horses. He makes it clear that the correct answer is no. He explains that it would be incorrect to do so, because in real life horses do not walk up and down a wall. For the same reason, he tells the children that they would not carpet a room with representations of flowers, even though Sissy disagrees. Everything, says the gentleman, must be regulated by Fact. They must discard Fancy altogether. Gradgrind then hands over the lesson to the schoolteacher, M'Choakumchild, who proceeds, we are led to believe, to fill up the children with a lot of Facts.
	In chapter 3, Gradgrind walks home from school he passes by a circus, set up in a wooden pavilion. He disapproves of such entertainments and walks on past it, but the turn of the road takes him past the back of the circus booth. There, to his annoyance, he finds two of his children, Louisa and Thomas, peeping in. He rebukes them and leads them back home.
	Chapter 4 introduces Mr. Bounderby, the rich banker. He is at Stone Lodge, Gradgrind's home, talking to Mrs. Gradgrind, boasting, as he often does, about his deprived and wretched childhood. He says he was abandoned by his mother and raised by his grandmother, who was a drunkard. The point of his story is to bring great credit upon himself for overcoming such a bad start in life.
	Gradgrind and the children come home, and the children endure more reproaches for showing an interest in the circus. Mrs. Gradgrind banishes them to their studies. Gradgrind and Bounderby discuss why how children might have been misled. They conclude it is because Sissy Jupe is the daughter of circus folk, and she attends the same school as Gradgrind's children. They decide to pay Sissy's father a visit.
	Analysis
	The first chapters introduce one of the main themes of the novel, the contrast between Facts and Fancy, and the one-sidedness of the educational philosophy espoused by Gradgrind. He believes that all knowledge worth having must have a practical value, and to this end he trusts only in the rational intellect. Matters of the heart do not affect him; he dismisses imagination and entertainment as worthless, with no place in a child's education.
	In taking satirical aim at Gradgrind, Dickens was giving expression to his belief that the schools in England were doing a poor job of educating the whole child. In other of his writings of this period, Dickens complained that there was too much emphasis on cramming the children full of facts and figures.
	Dickens wrote Hard Times in 1854, at a time when there was an awareness in society of the need to make education more widely available and to improve the quality of schools. During the 1850s, the British government had established the first training colleges for schoolteachers. M'Choakumchild, another object of Dickens's biting satire, is obviously intended to be a graduate of one of these new training colleges. The message is clear: such teachers may have a lot of knowledge at their disposal (too much, according to Dickens), but if they look upon children simply as empty vessels waiting to be filled up with information, the results are going to be disappointing.
	The disastrous effect of such an educational system can already be seen in Louisa. As she is described in chapter 3, there is a dissatisfaction in her face, "" a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination keeping a life in itself somehow."" But her father is unable to see this early sign of distress in his daughter.

He says he was abandoned by his mother and raised by his grandmother, who was a drunkard. The point of his story is to bring great credit upon himself for overcoming such a bad start in life.
	Gradgrind and the children come home, and the children endure more reproaches for showing an interest in the circus. Mrs. Gradgrind banishes them to their studies. Gradgrind and Bounderby discuss why how children might have been misled. They conclude it is because Sissy Jupe is the daughter of circus folk, and she attends the same school as Gradgrind's children. They decide to pay Sissy's father a visit.
	Analysis
	The first chapters introduce one of the main themes of the novel, the contrast between Facts and Fancy, and the one-sidedness of the educational philosophy espoused by Gradgrind. He believes that all knowledge worth having must have a practical value, and to this end he trusts only in the rational intellect. Matters of the heart do not affect him; he dismisses imagination and entertainment as worthless, with no place in a child's education.
	In taking satirical aim at Gradgrind, Dickens was giving expression to his belief that the schools in England were doing a poor job of educating the whole child. In other of his writings of this period, Dickens complained that there was too much emphasis on cramming the children full of facts and figures.
	Dickens wrote Hard Times in 1854, at a time when there was an awareness in society of the need to make education more widely available and to improve the quality of schools. During the 1850s, the British government had established the first training colleges for schoolteachers. M'Choakumchild, another object of Dickens's biting satire, is obviously intended to be a graduate of one of these new training colleges. The message is clear: such teachers may have a lot of knowledge at their disposal (too much, according to Dickens), but if they look upon children simply as empty vessels waiting to be filled up with information, the results are going to be disappointing.
	The disastrous effect of such an educational system can already be seen in Louisa. As she is described in chapter 3, there is a dissatisfaction in her face, "" a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination keeping a life in itself somehow."" But her father is unable to see this early sign of distress in his daughter.

	Chapters 5-8
	Coketown is described as an industrial town marked by a stultifying conformity. The streets and buildings all look alike, and the people all follow the same routines. The red brick houses are all dirty from the smoke that belches from the many factories. Gradgrind and Bounderby walk down the street, trying to find out where Sissy's father lives. Then Sissy comes running by, chased by Bitzer, and Sissy shows them the way. She leads them down a narrow road to a small, shabby tavern called the Pegasus Arms. Her family lives upstairs. Her father is not there, however. Sissy goes to find him. Bounderby and Gradgrind meet E. W. B. Childers, one of the circus performers who is known for his daring acts on horseback, and Childers's assistant, a young man named Kidderminster. Childers informs his visitors that Sissy's father, troubled by his poor performances in the circus, has left her and will not return. He has not provided anything for his daughter. Sleary, the circus owner then appears. Taking pity on the deserted Sissy, Gradgrind offers her the chance to live in his house, and continue to attend the school, as long as she agrees never to communicate with any of the circus folk again. Sissy agrees because she knows, and is reminded by Sleary, that her father wanted her to have an education. She believes that her father will one day return.
	Chapter 7 introduces Mrs. Sparsit, Bounderby's elderly housekeeper. Bounderby is discussing with her the matter of Gradgrind's decision to take in Sissy Jupe. Bounderby does not approve of it, and has taken Sissy in for a night so that Gradgrind might have more time to consider. He feels that Sissy will not be a good influence on Louisa. Gradgrind arrives with Louisa, and Sissy is sent for. Gradgrind confirms that he will take Sissy in to his house, and she will attend the school. When she is not at school, she will help Mrs. Gradgrind, who is something of an invalid.
	In chapter 8, Tom Gradgrind complains to his sister about how much he hates his life. He hates the kind of education he is receiving. Louisa regrets that she cannot do more to cheer him up, but Tom acknowledges that she is the only pleasure he has. He resolves that when he leaves home and is apprenticed to Bounderby, he will find a way of enjoying himself. He thinks he knows how to handle Bounderby by playing on the affections Bounderby has for Louisa. Louisa gazes into the fire and wonders what the future holds for them both, only to be reproached by her mother, who entered the room unheard, for indulging in wonder, which her father has forbidden her to do.
	Analysis
	Chapter 5 introduces another major theme of the novel, the disastrous effects of industrialism. The description of Coketown, actually based on conditions in Manchester in the mid-nineteenth century, emphasizes the conformity and the narrowness of people's lives. The city is noisy, polluted, unnatural.
	The circus folk are the antithesis of Bounderby and Gradgrind. Not only are they more warm-hearted than the two ""eminently practical"" men, they also represent fancy, as opposed to fact. Significantly, they live above a tavern (public house, or ""pub"" in English terminology) called The Pegasus Arms. Pegasus, the winged, flying horse from Greek mythology is pictured on the sign-board of the pub. Inside, there is a framed portrait of one of the circus horses, ""with real gauze let in for his wings, golden stars stuck on all over him, and his ethereal harness made of red silk."" He is described as ""another Pegasus."" The fact that the circus riders perform incredible feats on their ""flying"" horses can be set against the incident in chapter 1, in which the schoolchildren were told they should not paper walls with depictions of horses, since horses do not climb walls. But the circus horses, so skillfully handled by their riders, show that the merely factual description of a horse approved by Gradgrind conveys nothing of how the circus horses appeal to people's sense of wonder. This sense of wonder is something that mere facts and figures can never supply.

	Sissy struggles at school, failing to master all the facts and figures that are thrown at her by Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild. She thinks she is stupid. However, her conversations with Louisa about her education reveal that she is not stupid at all. But she looks at everything from the point of view of the heart, and this does not suit her well to the type of education she is receiving. She stays on at the school only because she knows her father wanted her to have an education. She still believes that one day he will return. Sissy confides in Louisa and tells her stories about her father. A friendship begins to grow between them.
	Chapter10 introduces Stephen Blackpool, a hard-working factory hand. After work one evening he walks his long-time lady friend Rachel home. Then he returns to his own lodgings, which consists of a single room above a shop. When he lights the candle he discovers that his drunken wife, having apparently been gone for some while, has returned. Stephen is appalled. It is clear that there is no love between them.
	The next day at noon, Stephen walks to Bounderby's house and requests an interview with Bounderby. Bounderby has a generally low opinion of the factory hands, but he has a reasonably good impression of Stephen. Stephen asks Bounderby's advice. He has been married to his wife for nineteen years, but soon after they married she ""went bad,"" meaning that she took to drink. He was patient with her, but on many occasions she would sell everything he owned to keep herself in drink. She left him several times but always came back. He tried paying her to stay away. But now she has returned. He tells Bounderby that he cannot stand it any more and wants to be rid of her. Bounderby is unsympathetic. He tells Stephen that marriage is a sacred bond and he must live with the situation. Stephen persists. He knows that rich people can get divorced, and wants to know if he can too. Bounderby replies that a divorce would cost him much more than he could afford, and the procedure is complicated. Stephen complains that everything is a muddle, which angers Bounderby, who begins to lose his earlier favorable impression of the man.
	After he leaves Bounderby, Stephen encounters an old woman who makes a lot of inquiries about Bounderby, but does not explain why she wants to know about him. She says she has traveled forty miles to see him. Now she must go back without even having caught a glimpse of him.
	After leaving the factory in the afternoon, Stephen waits for Rachel but she does not come. He thinks regretfully of the future they will never have together.
	Analysis
	Stephen Blackpool is introduced into the story to show the essential decency of the working man, as opposed to the callous indifference and stupidity of men such as Bounderby and Gradgrind.
	Dickens's purpose in describing Stephen's bad marriage was to attack England's restrictive divorce laws. What Bounderby tells Stephen is accurate. It was almost impossible at the time for a man of Stephen Blackpool's limited means to get a divorce. Divorce was available only for the wealthy. During the 1850s there was considerable pressure on the government for a change in the divorce laws. Dickens contributed to the debate not only in Hard Times but also in articles he wrote in his magazine, Household Words. In 1857, a few years after Hard Times was published, a Divorce Act was passed by the British parliament. The intention was to make divorce more easily available. However, although the number of reasons for which a divorce could be granted were increased, in practice there was still one law for the rich and another for the poor.

	Stephen returns home, to find Rachel attending his sick and injured wife. Rachel is trying to do what little she can for her. She says she will stay until three o'clock in the morning. Stephen sees a bottle of medicine that Rachel is applying to the woman's wound. He shudders because he knows that the medicine is poisonous if drunk. Then on Rachel's suggestion, he sits in his chair and falls asleep. When he wakes up he sees Rachel dozing on another chair. He also sees his wife reaching out a hand for the medicine table. She is about to drink the deadly poison when Rachel wakes up, realizes what is happening, and wrests the bottle from the woman's hand. It is now three o'clock, and Rachel leaves. Stephen feels extremely grateful for her saintliness and all she does for him.
	A few years go by. Gradgrind tells Sissy that there is no point in her continuing at the school, but he allows her to continue to live with the family as general helper. Young Tom Gradgrind is apprenticed to Bounderby and moves to his house. Mr. Gradgrind gets elected as Member of Parliament for Coketown.
	Gradgrind informs Louisa that Bounderby has made a proposal of marriage to her. Although Bounderby is fifty years old and Louisa only twenty, Gradgrind clearly wants Louisa to accept the proposal. He asks her to consider the matter in a wholly practical manner, just as she has been trained to do everything else. Although she has no love for Bounderby, Louisa decides to accept his proposal. She does so in part because she wants to please her brother Tom. Tom knew what was coming and hinted to her that she should accept, because then they would be living in the same house, and he would like that.
	Bounderby is anxious about how Mrs. Sparsit, his housekeeper, will take the news of his forthcoming marriage. But she accepts it with equanimity and wishes him great happiness. In reality, she pities him. Bounderby knows that Mrs. Sparsit will not wish to remain living in the house now that he is to marry, so he offers her a private apartment at the Bank. He will also grant her an annual allowance. She accepts his offer.
	After an eight-week engagement, Bounderby and Louisa marry.
	Analysis
	Dickens rarely lets up in his satire on the utilitarian philosophy, with its emphasis on practicality and facts. No hint of romance is permitted to intrude itself on the engagement and marriage of Bounderby and Louisa.
	Gradgrind, for example dismisses the problem of the disparity between the ages of Louisa and Bounderby by the use of statistics. He reports that a large proportion of marriages in England and Wales are made between people of very different ages, and in more than three out of four cases, the elder party is the man. For Gradgrind, that settles the matter.
	The wedding is an entirely practical affair. All the preparations for it take on, as Dickens puts it, ""a manufacturing aspect."" As befits the manufacturing town of Coketown, things are made in honor of the occasion: dresses, jewelry, cakes, gloves. There is no poetic talk about time flying or slowing down. Time in Coketown always passes with monotonous regularity. The wedding day comes ""as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason.""
	Gradgrind and Bounderby are too obtuse to notice it, but Louisa's spirit is already broken by the restricted education she has received. She has never been allowed to flourish emotionally or imaginatively, or in any way other than the strictly practical. Dickens creates a telling image of her when she speaks to her father about her lack of experience in anything other than ""problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be grasped."" As she says this, ""she unconsciously closed her hand, as if upon a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she were releasing dust or ash."" Louisa has a habit of gazing into the fire to stimulate her imagination; the image here of emptiness and ashes show how her inner life has withered or been burnt up until it hardly exists any more.

Book the Second: Reaping

	It is a sunny summer's afternoon about a year later. Bitzer, the bank porter, brings Mrs. Sparsit's tea to her apartment. (Bitzer is the boy who was in Sissy's class at school, and who gave the factual definition of a horse that pleased Gradgrind.) In addition to his duties as porter, Bitzer also acts as spy and informant for the bosses. He reports to Mrs. Sparsit that Tom Gradgrind, who is now a junior employee of the bank, is lazy and extravagant with money. Bitzer comments that most of the workers in the town are like that, and he carefully distances himself from them, emphasizing how prudent he is in saving money. These are sentiments with which Mrs. Sparsit heartily agrees.
	A stranger, a gentleman, arrives to see Mrs. Sparsit. The visitor is Mr. James Harthouse, and he has a letter of introduction from Gradgrind in London to Bounderby. He inquires of Mrs. Sparsit where Bounderby lives, and as they chat, he asks her about Louisa Bounderby. He has heard alarming reports about her as being hard-headed and unapproachable. He is surprised when Mrs. Sparsit informs him that Louisa is young; he had imagined her to be much older. After Harthouse leaves, Mrs. Sparsit spends a long time in contemplation. But she does not reveal her thoughts.
	It turns out that Harthouse has been recruited by Gradgrind and his friends in the ""hard facts"" school. They have sent him to Coketown so that he can become known there and in the neighborhood. Harthouse is not a true believer, however. He is a young gentleman who became bored with his leisurely life of traveling around the world and decided to do something else instead. It was convenient for him to get adopted by Gradgrind and his party, but he has no serious interest in their philosophy.
	Harthouse meets Bounderby, who gives him an absurd picture of how healthy a place Coketown is: the smoke is good for the lungs, the mills are pleasant places to work in, and the jobs pay well too. Bounderby then introduces Harthouse to Louisa. Harthouse confides in her that he accepts Bounderby's opinions simply because one set of opinions is as good, or as bad, as any other. But he is quite prepared to act as if he did believe in them. At dinner, Harthouse is bored by Bounderby's conversation, but is intrigued by Louisa. He realizes she does not love Bounderby, but he notices her affection for her brother Tom. Thinking that the way to make an impression on Louisa is through her brother, he shows a liking for him.
	That evening, Tom accompanies Harthouse back to his hotel. He is flattered by the friendship Harthouse is extending to him. Tom confirms Harthouse's impression that Louisa does not care for her husband. Tom adds that Louisa married Bounderby just to please her brother. He, Tom, had wanted the marriage because he didn't want Louisa to offend Bounderby, thinking this might have adverse consequences for himself, given that he was an employee at Bounderby's bank.
	It is late at night before Tom leaves the hotel. He has unwittingly supplied Harthouse with enough information about Louisa to give Harthouse ideas about how to approach her romantically.
	The scene switches in chapter 4 to a meeting of the factory hands' union. A union organizer named Slackbridge gives a fiery speech, telling the men they must unite to defeat their oppressors. Then he denounces Stephen Blackpool, calling him a traitor for refusing to join the union. Stephen rises to defend himself. He says he cannot support the proposed regulations that the union is promoting at the mill. He says they will not do the workers any good, although he does not explain why. However, he adds that this is not the reason he is not supporting the union. He has other reasons, although he does not elaborate on what they might be.
	Stephen leaves the meeting knowing that he is likely to be shunned by everyone in the union. This is indeed what happens. He is ""sent to Coventry,"" which means that no one will speak to him or even acknowledge his presence. After four days of this treatment, Stephen is summoned to a meeting with Bounderby.
	Analysis
	The second book, appropriately called ""Reaping,"" begins to show the dismal results of the Gradgrind educational philosophy. Bitzer has learned his lessons well and is ready to rise in the world. But Dickens does not intend this as a compliment to Bitzer. Bitzer shows promise only because he always acts from cold calculation, which Mrs. Sparsit mistakes as ""principle."" Bitzer is a very unpleasant young man, whose principal achievement so far appears to have been to get his mother confined to the workhouse (where the poor were sent to work for their keep).
	Unlike Bitzer, Tom Gradgrind has not absorbed any lessons from his education. But he does not reject the ""hard facts"" philosophy in favor of something better. He has no knowledge of anything better, so his life simply falls quickly into ruin.
	The devastating effects of Louisa's restricted upbringing and education are already apparent in her loveless marriage to Bounderby. But Dickens has more in store for her, and that is why he introduces Harthouse into the story. The amoral Harthouse cares little for anybody or anything, and is only out to amuse himself. When he sets his sights on Louisa, it is obvious that the outcome will be bad.
	Stephen Blackpool is included as a contrast. He and Rachel are the only couple in the book who have a genuine, steadfast love for each other.

Book the Second: Reaping
	Chapters 5-8
	Bounderby asks Stephen about what has happened between him and the other men. Stephen replies that he has nothing to say about it. Bounderby asks him directly why he refuses to join the union, but all Stephen will say is that he gave a promise (to Rachel, as will be revealed in the next chapter). Bounderby makes disparaging remarks about the union officials and the working men, but Stephen defends them, addressing Louisa rather than Bounderby. Then Bounderby asks him what the men in general complain about. Stephen replies in a matter-of-fact kind of way, explaining about the poor living and working conditions the people endure. He also points out that the bosses think they are always right and the workers always wrong. When Bounderby asks him how he would remedy the situation, Stephen says it will do no good to prosecute the union leaders, as Bounderby threatens. Stephen refuses to speak ill of the men who have rejected him. He does not pretend to know how relations between employers and employees can be improved. But he does explain what will not work, and that includes treating people as if they were soulless machines. Bounderby objects to Stephen's words, calls him a complainer, and then fires him. Stephen knows this means he will not be able to obtain work elsewhere.
	When he leaves Bounderby's, Stephen meets Rachel in the street. She is accompanied by the mysterious old woman whom Stephen met earlier (Book 1, chapter 12). The old woman has been waiting outside Bounderby's house in order to catch a glimpse of his wife. Stephen tells Rachel he has been fired, and that he plans to leave Coketown, although he does not know where he will go. They all go to Stephen's lodgings for tea. His wife has been gone for months.
	The old woman's name is Mrs. Pegler. She says she is a widow, and that she has a son, but she will say nothing about him. At that moment, Louisa arrives, accompanied by Tom. Louisa wants to help Stephen. Stephen says that he plans to leave Coketown on foot and seek employment elsewhere. Louisa offers him some money, and he accepts two pounds, a smaller sum than she offered. When Louisa is about to leave, Tom takes Stephen aside, saying he may be able to help him. He tells Stephen to hang around outside the bank for an hour in the evenings before he departs. Tom may be able to do him a good turn, and if he can, he will send Bitzer to him with a message. Stephen waits each evening for three days outside the bank. But he receives no message. He leaves town on foot on a summer morning.
	For his own amusement, Harthouse pursues Louisa, trying to get her to fall in love with him. In the woods near Bounderby's country house, fifteen miles from town, Harthouse engages Louisa in conversation by pretending an interest in her brother Tom. He tells her that Tom probably has gambling debts, and he, Harthouse, wishes to help him. Louisa admits that she knows of the problem, and has lent Tom money. Harthouse then says that his aim is to get Tom to behave better towards his sister.
	Harthouse sees Tom in the distance and they go to meet him. Tom is in a depressed mood. After Louisa goes into the house, Tom confesses to Harthouse that he is in a financial mess. He resents his sister for not giving him more money, which he believes she could easily obtain from her husband. Harthouse offers to advise Tom on how he can get out of debt, and asks in return that Tom be more loving towards his sister. Tom readily agrees.
	Bounderby breaks the news to Harthouse that the bank has been robbed. The amount stolen amounts to no more than a hundred and fifty pounds. It was stolen from Tom's safe. Stephen Blackpool is suspected of the crime, since he was seen hanging around the bank at night. The old woman is also suspected of being involved.
	Tom, who has been helping the police, returns late at night. Louisa, who suspects he may have had something to do with the robbery, asks him if he has anything to say to her. Tom says he does not know what she is talking about.
	Analysis
	Critics of Hard Times often say that the characterization is not as strong as in Dickens's other novels. Chapter 5 presents some evidence for that view. Bounderby's behavior is so outrageously bad that it strains credulity. And conversely, Stephen, both in this chapter and throughout, is so unfailingly good that it is hard to believe in him as a real person. Readers must make up their own minds about whether these characters come across as believable, or whether Dickens's desire to present workers in the best possible light and employers in the worst possible light has blunted his instincts as a writer.
	It is also sometimes pointed out that although Dickens is savage in his criticism of industrialism and industrial relations, he offers no solution to the problem. There may be some truth in this, but Stephen's long speech to Bounderby, in which he explains everything that will not work, contains within it the germ of a new approach. It is a call to end the divisive, confrontational attitude to employer-employee relations, in which there must always be a victor and a vanquished. It is also a rejection of the ""laissez-faire"" economic philosophy of the utilitarians, what Stephen calls ""lettin alone."" This was a philosophy of complete economic freedom that allowed market forces to govern industry, without any regulation by government. Laissez-faire economics resulted in dangerous working conditions, low pay, and the other ills suffered by the factory workers in Hard Times.

Book the Second: Reaping
	Chapters 9-12
	Mrs. Sparsit shows great interest in Harthouse's attempts to get to know Louisa. She also shows great solicitude to Bounderby, which has the effect of alienating him from his wife, and pushing Louisa closer to Harthouse. This is an effect that Mrs. Sparsit intends, since she has goodwill neither to Bounderby nor his wife.
	Louisa returns to Stone Lodge, her father's home, to attend to her mother at the old woman's death.
	Following the bank robbery, Mrs. Sparsit stays temporarily at Bounderby's country house. She takes pleasure in contemplating what she anticipates will be Louisa's fall. She observes Louisa and Harthouse from her window, talking together in the garden, and she continues to observe them day by day as their relationship develops.
	When Bounderby goes away on business for a few days, Mrs. Sparsit spies on Louisa and Harthouse, who are alone together at Bounderby's country house. Mrs. Sparsit believes that Harthouse has deliberately arranged for Tom to be out of the house. She eavesdrops on the conversation between Louisa and Harthouse, listening as Harthouse tries to arrange a place for the two of them to meet in private, since Louisa has not welcomed him to the house. Putting his arm around her, he declares that he loves her.
	When it starts to rain, Louisa goes into the house, soon to reemerge and leave. Mrs. Sparsit assumes Louisa is going to a secret meeting somewhere with Harthouse, and she follows her. Louisa takes a train to Coketown and Mrs. Sparsit does likewise. She expects that Louisa will wait for Harthouse, who will be riding back to Coketown on his horse. But at the railway station Mrs. Sparsit loses track of Louisa.
	Louisa arrives at her father's house. Gradgrind is at home, since parliament is on vacation. Louisa pours out her feelings to him. She expresses regrets for the narrow way in which she was raised, without being allowed to cultivate any of the emotions, feelings or sensibilities that would have made her life worth living. She confesses that she hates her husband. Gradgrind is distressed at her words, since he had no idea that she was so unhappy. Louisa then confesses that she may be in love with Harthouse, although since she is inexperienced in such matters, she does not know for sure. She tells her father that Harthouse is expecting her at that very moment. She agreed to go somewhere to meet him because that was the only way she could get out of his presence. She begs her father to save her. Then she faints, falling at his feet.
	Analysis
	This section is dominated by the crisis into which Louisa sinks, for which Dickens has been carefully laying the groundwork since the start of Book Two. The cause of the predicament in which Louisa finds herself is clear from the explanations she gives to her father, even though she does not wish to blame him. Everything goes back to the narrow principles on which she was raised. This upbringing has blighted her life and now everything has come to a head. It was probably inevitable that at some point in Louisa's life, someone would come along who would speak to the emptiness inside her and call up long buried dreams and emotions.
	The incident in which Louisa confesses everything to her father is also the start of Gradgrind's rehabilitation. He must be given credit for the receptive, sympathetic way he listens to Louisa. From the beginning of the novel, Gradgrind has been presented as a less hard man than Bounderby. He is not unkind. His mistake was to adopt a foolish set of principles to live by.

Book the Third: Garnering
	Chapters 1-4
	In the morning, Louisa receives visits from her younger sister Jane, and then from her father. Gradgrind is devastated by what Louisa told him the previous evening. It seems to him as if the whole foundation of his life, the system on which he lived, has been swept away. He assures his daughter that he had meant to do right, but now he mistrusts his own ability to help her. After Gradgrind leaves, Louisa is visited by Sissy. The two women rekindle their friendship, which had gone cold after Louisa married Bounderby.
	Harthouse is agitated by Louisa's failure to turn up at his hotel. The next day he tries to find out where she is, without success. Then Sissy comes to visit him. She tells him that he has no chance of ever seeing Louisa again, although she emphasizes that Louisa has not sent her to say this. She also tells him that he must leave Coketown immediately and never return, since that is the only way he can mitigate the harm he has done. Harthouse admits he is to blame for the situation and reluctantly accedes to Sissy's request. He leaves Coketown later that day.
	Mrs. Sparsit has told Bounderby about the conversation she overheard between Louisa and Harthouse, and he takes her immediately to see Gradgrind. But Gradgrind says he already knows the story, and hastens to add that Louisa came straight to him for protection. Bounderby rebukes Mrs. Sparsit and sends her back to the bank. Gradgrind tells Bounderby that he would like Louisa to stay with him, Gradgrind, for a while, attended by Sissy. Bounderby is furious and says, among other things, that Louisa does not appreciate his merits. Gradgrind tries to speak to Bounderby in a reasonable tone, asking that he cooperate in helping Louisa to recover, but Bounderby gets more and more angry. Eventually he issues an ultimatum: unless Louisa returns to his house by noon the next day, he will assume that she prefers to remain at her father's, and he will send her belongings along. The next day, since Louisa has not returned, he does exactly what he promised. He then puts his country house up for sale and resumes a bachelor life.
	Bounderby offers a reward for the arrest of Stephen Blackpool in connection with the bank robbery. Posters are put all around Coketown to this effect. Slackbridge, the union delegate, uses this to once more denounce Stephen at a meeting. Meanwhile, Bounderby, Tom and Rachel go to see Louisa. Rachel gets Louisa to confirm that she, Louisa, visited Stephen before his departure and gave him money. Bounderby had disbelieved Rachel's story about this but is now forced to acknowledge its truth. Rachel says she has written to Stephen, and she expects him to return to Coketown within two days to clear his name. After the visitors have gone, Louisa tells her father that she believes Stephen to be innocent.
	Over a week passes, but Stephen does not return. No one knows of his whereabouts.
	Analysis
	As Gradgrind continues to soften, and to see the inadequacy of the principles of reason he has lived by, he succinctly expresses one of the main themes of the novel. The moment comes when he tells Louisa in the first chapter of book 3, ""Some persons hold. . . that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart."" Up to this point, he has not believed this to be true; he had thought the head sufficient, but now he knows that it may not be.
	In these chapters, Sissy, who knows the wisdom of the heart, emerges as probably the strongest, most balanced of the characters in Gradgrind's world. She seems to have been able to resist the bad influence of the education she received and the emotionally stifled atmosphere of the Gradgrind home. She is naturally connected to the values of the heart. It is this that gives her the strength to confront Harthouse and insist that he comply with her wishes.

Book the Third: Garnering
	Chapters 5-9
	Rachel confesses to Sissy that she thinks someone may have deliberately prevented Stephen from returning to proclaim his innocence. She even fears that he may have been murdered. As the two women walk together in the street, an excited Mrs. Sparsit alights from a coach with an unwilling Mrs. Pegler. Mrs. Sparsit insists on taking the old woman to Bounderby.
	Rachel, Sissy, Gradgrind, Tom, Mrs. Sparsit and Mrs. Pegler gather in Bounderby's dining room. Bounderby is extremely discomfited by the sight of Mrs. Pegler, who turns out to be his mother. Mrs. Pegler sets the story straight about Bounderby's early years. She did not desert him, as he has always claimed. She looked after him as well as she could, bearing in mind that his father died when he was eight. She skimped on her own needs and managed to apprentice her son to a kind master. Bounderby has been paying her a small allowance all these years in exchange for a promise that she will stay away from him. Bounderby refuses to explain his family affairs to the gathered company, and asks them to leave. But he is humbled by the disclosure that he has lied about his past.
	On a bright Sunday in autumn, Sissy and Rachel take a train a few miles out of Coketown and walk in the country. They have not been walking long when they find a hat lying in the grass. It belongs to Stephen. Nearby, they almost fall down a concealed, disused mine shaft. They realize that Stephen must have fallen down it, and they call down for him, but there is no reply. They run to get help. Soon a group of men from the nearest village arrives. It takes four hours before a machine is rigged up in which two men are lowered into the mine shaft. A crowd of over a hundred, including Louisa, Gradgrind and Bounderby, looks on. One man returns to the surface and reports that Stephen is alive but badly injured. Apparently he was walking back to Coketown when, in the dark, he fell down the shaft. It is dark before Stephen can be brought to the surface. He speaks to Rachel and then asks Gradgrind to clear his name by asking Tom about the matter. Stephen dies as the men carry him across the fields and down the lanes.
	Tom goes missing. Gradgrind and Louisa both suspect he is guilty of the robbery and that he deliberately cast suspicion on Stephen Blackpool. Sissy explains that Tom, on her advice, has taken refuge with the circus folk, in a town three hours away from the port city of Liverpool. They make the journey, Gradgrind traveling separately. He plans to have Tom sent to America. Louisa and Sissy arrive first and meet Sleary in the circus booth. All the circus people crowd around Sissy, whom they have not seen for many years. Tom is dressed up as in a comic outfit as a black servant. Later, when Gradgrind arrives, Tom tells of how he carried out the robbery. Sleary plans to send Tom by coach, and then by rail, to Liverpool. Tom, who has harsh words for his sister, is about to depart when Bitzer arrives and grabs him.
	Gradgrind pleads with Bitzer not to take Tom back to Coketown. But Bitzer is determined to do so. He expects that Bounderby will reward him by promoting him to Tom's position at the bank. Gradgrind tries to bargain with him but to no avail; Bitzer succeeds in turning Gradgrind's philosophy of hard practicality against him. But Sleary arranges for Tom to be rescued on the way back to Coketown. Sleary's aggressive dog prevents Bitzer from giving chase. Tom is duly sent to America.
	The novel ends with a glimpse of what happens to the major characters in the future. Mrs. Sparsit, having been sent away by Bounderby, lives in cramped quarters with her unpleasant relative, Lady Scadgers. Bounderby dies five years later, of a fit. His will is the subject of endless disputes. Gradgrind tries to live by the virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity, but he is scorned by his former political associates. Rachel continues to take pity on Stephen's drunken widow. Tom is lonely in America, and comes back to England, but dies before he can be reconciled with Louisa. Sissy marries and has children. Louisa tries to encourage in others the ""imaginative graces and delights"" that enrich life. She sees this as her duty.
	Analysis
	There are no happy endings in this bleak novel. There is some justice, but there is also some tragic injustice. Those who get their just desserts include Bounderby, whose fabrications are publicly exposed, and Tom, who pays a high price for his misspent life. Gradgrind fares little better. His ""hard facts"" philosophy turns round and bites him in the form of Bitzer, who continues to show that he has learned his lessons well. The repentant Gradgrind is a broken man. Louisa is left to make the best of things and to try to live by the values that are inherent in her but which were crushed by her upbringing and her marriage. The main injustice in the novel is of course the persecution and tragic death of Stephen Blackpool, which is hardly lightened by the sentimental way Dickens describes it. In short, these last chapters show the consequences for everyone when life is lived according to narrow principles, using only the intellect at the expense of the heart.

Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary,"Act I Scene 1-2
	The Merry Wives of Windsor begins with Justice Shallow complaining to Sir Hugh Evans that he has been abused by Falstaff. Shallow's cousin Slender backs him up, and Evans agrees to take up the matter on Shallow's behalf.
	Evans then changes the subject, and mentions Anne Page, a girl of marriageable age. Anne has inherited, or will inherit, a sizable amount of money, which makes her a desirable bride. Evans wants to arrange a match between Anne and Slender.
	They go the house of George Page, Anne's father. Falstaff is inside, and Shallow tells Page that Falstaff has wronged him. Page replies that Falstaff has admitted as much.
	Falstaff enters with his cronies, Bardolph, Nym and Pistol. Shallow accuses Falstaff of beating his men, killing his deer and breaking into his lodge. Falstaff admits it, but when Shallow says he will take the matter to the Council, Falstaff tells him he will be laughed at. Slender then says that Bardolph, Nym and Pistol carried him to the tavern, got him drunk, and then picked his pocket.
	Evans replies that he, Page, and the Host of the Garter Inn should arbitrate the matter. Questioned by Falstaff, Pistol denies that he robbed Slender. Bardolph claims that Slender was too drunk to know what was happening and has drawn the wrong conclusion, while Slender vows that in future, he will only get drunk in the company of righteous people, not drunken rogues.
	Anne Page enters with her mother, and Mrs. Ford. Page invites all the company to have dinner with them, and everyone exits except Shallow, Slender and Evans. Evans and Shallow want to know whether Slender thinks he would be able to love Anne Page. Slender agrees to do whatever is expected of him, including marrying the girl. He expresses no great enthusiasm for the prospect, though.
	Anne Page enters and invites them to the dinner table. Shallow and Evans exit, leaving Anne alone with Slender. She tries to persuade him to come to dinner, but Slender says he is not hungry. He is only persuaded when Page returns and summons him, but even then he insists that Anne go in first.
	In scene 2, Evans gives Simple, Slender's servant, a letter to deliver to Mistress Quickly. The letter asks Quickly to inform Anne of the nature of Slender's interest in her.
	Analysis
	The first scene sets the first plot, the courting of Anne Page, in motion. It makes clear that the motivation, at least as far as Evans is concerned, is money. This introduces the theme of the play, which contrasts the lure of money, as well as the match-making attempts of parents and others, with true love.
	This scene also highlights the fact that intermediaries (in this case, Shallow and Evans) are employed to set up the match. Using intermediaries to arrange a marriage was a common practice in Elizabethan England. As Ann Jenalie Cook explains in Making a Match: Courtship in Shakespeare and His Society, ""Especially in the upper social echelons families sought assistance in locating suitable marriage prospects. And, when located, a prospect still might require investigation by trusted friends or persuasion by powerful allies. A crucial decision like marriage could not be left to chance"" (p. 104). Shakespeare will have some fun satirizing the practice in this play.
	The first scene also accomplishes some characterization: Slender as an ineffectual yes-man who merely does what he is told; Shallow as a querulous old man who can no longer wield the authority he once enjoyed; Falstaff as something of a villain who is very much in charge of the situation at this point as he mocks Shallow's attempt to remonstrate with him. By showing Falstaff full of confidence, still the lord of his world, Shakespeare sets him up for his fall.

Act I Scene 3
	Falstaff tells the Host that he must get rid of some of his hangers-on, since his expenses are too high. The Host says he will give Bardolph a job as a tapster, serving liquor. Bardolph likes this idea, saying he has wanted such a life. Falstaff is pleased to get rid of him. Falstaff then confides to Pistol and Nym that he has almost run out of money, but he has hatched a scheme that will remedy his fortunes. He plans to seduce Ford's wife, since she has control of her husband's money. He has written her a love letter, and has also written to Mrs. Page with a similar idea in mind. She also controls her husband's money. Falstaff tells Pistol and Nym to deliver the respective letters, promising them that they will all thrive. But Pistol and Nym refuse, and Falstaff cuts them off from his company and gives the letters to Robin to deliver.
	Seeking revenge on Falstaff, Nym says he will inform Page of Falstaff's plan. Pistol says he will inform Ford.
	Analysis
	This scene sets the second plot, the humiliation of Falstaff, in motion. This plot has similarities with the other plot (the courting of Anne Page), since both are concerned with monetary gain for men through alliance with a woman. But whereas the courting of Anne Page (and her inheritance) is a socially acceptable way of advancing one's own financial interests, Falstaff's attempts to accomplish the same goal fall outside the bounds of the moral code that governs the life of the society depicted in the play.
	The Falstaff depicted in this scene, and throughout the Merry Wives of Windsor, is a lesser character than the witty, astute rogue who appears in Henry IV parts 1 and 2. The Falstaff of the Henry plays, for example, would not be foolish enough to think that the two women concerned were giving him ""the leer of invitation."" This Falstaff lacks both the self-knowledge and the shrewd judgment of the earlier comic figure.

Act I Scene 4
	At Dr. Caius's house, Mistress Quickly has received the letter from Evans, and she questions Simple about who Slender is, as she is having difficulty remembering him. She then instructs him to tell Evans that she will do what she can to further Slender's cause with Anne Page.
	Dr. Caius's servant John Rugby warns Quickly that Caius is on his way home. She shuts Simple in the closet, because she knows Caius will be angry if he finds him in the house.
	Caius enters, speaking almost unintelligible English in a French accent. He summons Rugby and then goes to the closet, where he discovers Simple. He is furious and tells Rugby to fetch his rapier. Quickly tries to calm him down by explaining that Simple came on an errand from Evans. She explains what the errand was, and then tells Simple in an aside that she will do what she can to advance Slender's cause with Anne Page, even though she knows that Caius is also in love with the girl. In the meantime, Caius writes a challenge to Evans (even though Evans was only the bearer of a message) and reproaches Quickly who, he says, promised that he would be able to have Anne. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him.
	After Caius exits, with Rugby in tow, Quickly in a soliloquy says that Caius has no chance with Anne. Quickly claims to knows Anne's mind better than anyone, and also has more influence on her than anyone.
	Fenton enters, inquiring about Anne, whom he wants to marry. Quickly assures him that Anne loves him. Fenton gives Quickly some money, and asks her to put in a good word for him to Anne. Quickly agrees, but after Fenton leaves, she lets on that Anne does not love him.
	Analysis
	Shakespeare's satire of the Elizabethan use of go-betweens in marriage negotiations kicks into high gear in this scene, in the figure of Mistress Quickly. She acts as a kind of universal go-between, promising to help all of Anne's various suitors. In this scene she manages to promise Slender, Caius and Fenton that she is on their side. She claims to know Anne's mind better than anyone. We see no evidence of this in the play, but Quickly seems to have convinced everyone it is true, and she is careful to give all the suitors hope, even if it means telling a few lies. She tells Fenton, for example, that Anne loves him, but as soon as he is gone, she reveals that Anne does not love him. We also see once more how money greases the wheels of love, since Fenton pays Quickly for her service. He gains nothing from this investment, however, since Quickly appears to do nothing at all to advance his cause.

Act II Scene 1
	Mrs. Page reads the love letter from Falstaff. She is outraged, especially on account of the fact that she has only met Falstaff a couple of times. She wants revenge on him for writing such a letter.
	Mrs. Ford then enters. She is agitated and asks for Mrs. Page's advice. She has, of course, just read the letter that Falstaff wrote to her. She is just as indignant as Mrs. Page is, and also wants revenge. Her plan is to lead Falstaff on by giving him some false hope.
	Mrs. Page examines the two letters and finds they are identical, except for the person to whom they are addressed. She is indignant, and thinks that Falstaff probably has a thousand such letters prepared, with a blank space where he inserts a different name each time.
	The two women resolve to trick Falstaff by arranging a meeting with him and leading him on him on until he has pawned all his horses to the Host of the Garter Inn. They think that pawning his horses is the only way Falstaff will be able to raise enough money to pursue his courtship of them.
	Mrs. Ford lets on that her husband is a jealous man, while Mrs. Page confesses that her husband is not. The two men then enter, with Pistol and Nym. Pistol is explaining to Ford that Falstaff is after his wife. Ford at first has a hard time believing this, since his wife is not young. But Pistol insists that what he says is true, and he also tells Page to believe what Nym is about to tell him.
	After Pistol exits, Ford says he intends to get to the bottom of the matter. Nym then tells Page that Falstaff loves Page's wife. After Nym exits, Page says he does not believe what he has been told, calling Nym a rogue.
	Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page see Quickly coming, and they resolve to use her to convey their message to Falstaff.
	After the women exit, Ford and Page discuss the allegations against Falstaff. Page dismisses them, saying that Falstaff would not do such a thing, and that those who informed on him are former men of his, so probably-he implies-have a grudge against him. He also says that even if Falstaff did have designs on his wife, he is confident that nothing would come of it. Ford is not so sure, however, and says that he would not trust his wife with Falstaff.
	The Host and then Shallow enter. They invite Page to come and watch a duel to be fought between Evans and Caius. Shallow takes Page aside and tells him that the Host has in fact told the duelers to go to different locations. Host speaks privately to Ford, and says he will introduce Ford, under the name of Brook, to Falstaff. After the Host, Shallow and Page exit, Ford speaks of his suspicions of his wife. She and Falstaff were together at Page's house, and he does not know what might have happened there. He resolves to pursue the matter by sounding out Falstaff.
	Analysis
	This scene reveals just how formidable these ""merry wives of Windsor"" are. They are not so much merry as vengeful, and poor Falstaff has no idea of what he has got himself into. In this play, it is the women who are in charge. It is easy to see why, from their forceful reactions to Falstaff's pitiful attempt to seduce them, that they dominate their husbands (remember that they control their husbands' money, which is why Falstaff is pursuing them).
	This scene also continues the comic parallel and contrast between the two different kinds of wooing in the play, one legitimate and moral, the other illegitimate and immoral. This is accomplished by having Mistress Quickly act as a go-between for Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page, just as she does for the suitors of Anne Page.

Act II Scene 2
	Pistol asks Falstaff to lend him money, but Falstaff refuses. He says he has had enough of deflecting the demands of Pistol's creditors and swearing to them that Pistol is a reliable man. He is still annoyed by Pistol's refusal to deliver his letter, and this prompts Pistol to relent.
	Mistress Quickly enters, and informs Falstaff that Mrs. Ford is thrilled by his letter. She thanks him a thousand times for it. She also wants him to know that her husband will be away from his house from ten to eleven. She invites Falstaff to visit. Quickly also informs Falstaff that his letter to Mrs. Page has also been well received. Mrs. Page's husband is seldom out of the house, however, but Mrs. Page hopes there will be a time when he is.
	Quickly then arranges for Falstaff's page, Robin, to be the go-between for him and Mrs. Page.
	Falstaff is delighted with his apparent success, and looks forward to getting some money from the two women.
	Bardolph enters, announcing to Falstaff that a man named Brook wishes to see him. Ford enters, disguised as Brook. Ford asks Falstaff for his help. He says he is in love with Mrs. Ford, and has pursued her in earnest, but she is not the slightest bit interested in him. Ford flatters Falstaff about how accomplished a man he is, and asks him to seduce Ford's wife, since he will be able to do it as easily as any man. Ford also offers him money.
	Falstaff does not understand what Ford's purpose is in asking him to do this. Ford explains that Mrs. Ford prides herself on her honor and her virtue. But if he could show her that he knows she has been having an affair with Falstaff, her defenses against him would no longer have any validity, and he would have a better chance with her.
	Falstaff willingly agrees to the proposition, and accepts Ford's money. He says he will be with Ford's wife between ten and eleven. He also takes the opportunity, in the presence of Brook, to insult and deride Ford as a cuckold (a man whose wife commits adultery) and a rogue.
	After Falstaff leaves, Ford gives vent to his jealousy, thinking he has proof of his wife's infidelity. He vows to prevent it from happening and be revenged on Falstaff.
	Analysis
	In this scene, Quickly does more work as a go-between and is true to her promise to keep the secrets of the merry wives. She also shows that being a matrimonial go-between can be a profitable enterprise. Just as Fenton paid her for her anticipated services in the earlier scene, Falstaff pays her in this one. And then money changes hands again when Ford pays Falstaff. ""If money go before, all ways do lie open,"" says Ford, a saying that certainly applies to the play so far, which has shown a lot of financial transactions and much desire for monetary gain, and very little actual love.
	In his outburst of jealousy, Ford is a comic version of other jealous husbands in Shakespeare's plays, such as Leontes (in The Winter's Tale) and Othello, both of whom suspect their wives without cause.

Act II Scene 3
	- Act III Scene 1
	In a field near Windsor, Dr. Caius is angry that Evans has not shown up for the duel. Page, Shallow, Slender and the Host enter, telling Caius that they have come to see the duel, even though they know that Evans has been directed to another place, the other side of town. Caius claims Evans is a coward. He still wants to kill him.
	The men plan to continue their joke at Caius's expense. They agree to take him to Frogmore, where Evans has been sent. But they tell Caius they are taking him to see Anne Page, and he will have the opportunity to woo her. The Host even promises to be his advocate.
	In the next scene, at a field near Frogmore, Evans awaits Caius for the duel and sends Simple out to look for him. After Simple exits, Evans reveals that secretly he is relieved Caius has not shown up.
	Page, Shallow and Slender enter. Pretending that they do not know what the situation is, they tell Evans that Caius is nearby, and is very upset at being wronged. In a show of bravado, Evans denounces him as a cowardly knave.
	The Host, Caius and Rugby enter. Evans and Caius offer to fight, but Evans also takes Caius aside and offers him friendship, while saying aloud for the benefit of the others that he will beat Caius up for reneging on his appointment. Caius makes some aggressive remarks, but the Host calms the situation down and confesses that he deliberately directed them to different places because he did not want to lose either his doctor (Caius) or his priest (Evans). He asks them to put away their swords and be reconciled. After the Host exits, Caius and Evans agree to be revenged on him for his deceit. Caius is angry because he was told that he would be meeting Anne Page there.
	Analysis
	These short scenes are mostly a diversion from the main plots. Both are examples of dramatic irony, which occurs when the audience, or the other characters, know something about the situation that one or more characters do not. In Act 2, scene 2, for example, all but Caius know that Evans has been deliberately directed by the Host to another part of town, so the duel will not take place. (This information is conveyed in Act 2, scene 1.) The humor of the scene consists in the mocking of the pompous and hot-tempered Caius, and his exclamations in terrible English, just as the humor of Act 3, scene 1 is at the expense of Evans, the other would-be duelist. The humor lies in the contrast between Evans's fighting words and his real, less courageous sentiments.

Act III Scene 2
	Ford encounters Mrs. Page with Falstaff's page, Robin, which leads Ford to jump to conclusions and mock the absent Page for his stupidity in not suspecting his wife. He vows that he will torture his wife, expose Mrs. Page and show what a fool Page is. He resolves to go to his own house when he knows Falstaff will be there with his wife.
	Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Evans and Caius enter. They are on their way to dine with Anne Page. Shallow and Slender hope to have an answer that day as to whether Slender will be able to marry Anne. Page supports his suit, but Mrs. Page prefers Caius. Host mentions Fenton, but Page says that Fenton is from too high a social class to be suitable for his daughter.
	Ford invites them all to his house to witness a monster (that is, Falstaff).
	Analysis
	Caius's remark to Page that Mistress Quickly has told him that Anne loves him shows that Quickly has been working behind the scenes to encourage her clients, even if that means completely disregarding the truth.
	Page's complete rejection of Fenton, in spite of the Host's extravagant praise of the young man, comes down, as does so much in this play, to a matter of money. Page says Fenton is too worldly wise and keeps company with a higher level of society than would be suitable for the middle-class Anne, but this is really only a smokescreen. His real complaint seems to be that Fenton, although of a higher social class, has no money, and Page is determined that Fenton is not going to repair his fortune's at Page's expense: ""no, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance."" Money rules!

Act III Scene 3
	At Ford's house, Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page rehearse their plot to dump Falstaff in a dirty laundry basket and empty it in a muddy ditch on the banks of the River Thames.
	Falstaff enters and declares his love for Mrs. Ford. Mrs. Ford goes along with him, replying that she loves him too. But then, as rehearsed, Robin enters, saying that Mrs. Page has arrived in a state of some excitement, and must see Mrs. Ford immediately. Falstaff, not wanting Mrs. Page to find him there, hides behind an arras (a tapestry wall-hanging).
	Mrs. Page rushes in and says that Ford is coming to the house, with a crowd of officials, to look for a man who is taking advantage of Mrs. Ford in her husband's absence. Mrs. Page urges her friend to get rid of the man, if he is indeed there. She suggests putting him in the laundry basket. Mrs. Ford says he is too big for it, but then the terrified Falstaff, who has overheard all of this-as he was meant to-emerges from his hiding place and says he can fit in the basket. Mrs. Page professes surprise to see him there, and asks him if the letters are his. He has time only to say that he loves her before he gets into the basket. Mrs. Ford summons her servants to take the basket away.
	Ford, Page, Caius and Evans enter as the servants exit. Ford locks the door of the house. He goes to search the house, and the other men follow him.
	Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford enjoy their joke and plan more tricks against Falstaff. They agree to send Mistress Quickly to him to excuse the incident and give him fresh hope. Then they will lead him on to another punishment.
	Ford and the others return. Since they have found no one, Ford is forced to admit that he was in the wrong, and he asks his wife to forgive him.
	Analysis
	This amusing central scene constitutes the first of Falstaff's three humiliations. The humor is the physical humor of farce, rather than the intellectual humor that characterizes Falstaff's scenes in the Henry IV plays. For those who are reading the play rather than watching a performance of it, it is essential to try and stage this scene in the mind's eye in order to appreciate it.

	Fenton tells Anne Page that he is discouraged in his attempt to win her hand, because her father is refusing to support him. He says that at first he courted Anne because her father was wealthy, but he has since come to see that she is worth more than any amount of gold. Anne tells him not to give up, but to continue to seek her father's favor.
	Shallow, Slender and Mistress Quickly enter. They have brought the painfully shy Slender to talk to Anne. He is scared of approaching her, and when he and Shallow do approach, he lets Shallow do all the talking, merely echoing what Shallow says. Anne finally asks Shallow to let Slender woo her by himself. Slender does not do much to advance his cause. He tells Anne that he is wooing her only because her father and his uncle put his name forward. He does not seem to care much whether he marries Anne or not.
	Page enters with his wife, and urges Anne to love Slender. He is annoyed to see Fenton there as well, and reiterates that he will not give Fenton permission to marry his daughter.
	After Page, Shallow and Slender have gone, Fenton presses his claims with Mrs. Page, saying that he loves Anne. Anne pleads that she does not want to marry Slender, whom she thinks is a fool. Nor does she want to marry Caius, whose suit Mrs. Page appears to be considering. After her daughter's protests, Mrs. Page softens her tone, and tells Fenton she will talk to Anne and find out how she feels about him.
	Left alone with Fenton, Quickly tells him that is it because of her that he now appears to have a chance with Anne. After Fenton exits, Quickly says that she will in fact continue to act as advocate for Caius and Slender, but also, and specially, for Fenton.
	Analysis
	This scene is written partially in verse, the first scene in the play to use verse. Appropriately enough, the blank verse lines are given to Fenton, the gentleman, who explains to Anne that although he pursued her at first for her money, he now loves her for herself. This is the first counterweight to the predominant theme of money as the main motivating factor in prospective marriages. Here it is love that is important, not money, and Fenton and Anne have to figure out a way of enabling love to triumph. The scene with Fenton and Anne is immediately contrasted with the ludicrous attempt of Shallow to get Slender to make an impression on Anne, which he totally fails to do. The message is clear: real love is superior to attempts made by advocates and go-betweens to secure a marriage based on expediency rather than love.
	Mistress Quickly is still getting up to her tricks and profiting by them. She convinces Fenton that the softening of Anne's mother towards him is her own doing, and then accepts another payment from him. For Quickly, match-making continues to be a profitable business!

Act III Scene 5
	Falstaff tells Bardolph to get him some wine and a piece of toast. He speaks with disgust of his ordeal in being tossed into the river. Quickly enters, and Falstaff responds coldly to her. Quickly then explains that Mrs. Ford has told her that the men made a mistake in throwing the basket into the river. It was not her fault, and she is upset about it. She sends word that her husband will be out hunting birds from eight to nine, and she desires to see Falstaff again. Falstaff agrees to try again.
	Ford enters, disguised again as Brook. He inquires about what happened between Falstaff and Mrs. Page. Falstaff tells him the entire truth, including another long speech about the discomfort and indignity he suffered in the basket. Ford assumes that Falstaff will no longer be pursuing Mrs. Ford, but Falstaff tells him of the new plan. It is past eight o'clock so he is ready to depart. He promises Brook again that he, Brook, will enjoy Ford's wife.
	After Falstaff exits, Ford is once more beside himself with jealousy and vows that Falstaff will not escape this time.
	Analysis
	In his soliloquy at the beginning of the scene, in which he laments his ducking in the Thames, Falstaff shows some of the wit and verbal exuberance that mark his character in the Henry IV plays. If earlier in the play, he has been something of a villain, threatening to disrupt the harmony of the community, here he appears more as victim than villain. These opposite perspectives on his character and his role in the play will continue until the end.
	However, for all the wit Falstaff shows in verbalizing about his humiliation, he is still easily taken in by the merry wives' next scheme. In this respect he appears as little more than a stage buffoon rather than one of the great comic characters in English drama. Those who love Falstaff from the Henry plays are often distressed by his reduction in stature (although not in physical bulk) here.

Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary: Act IV Scene 1-2,"
	 
Act IV
	Scene 1-2
	Scene 1 is a short scene which is a digression from the main plot. Evans tries to instruct Mrs. Page's son William in Latin grammar.
	In scene 2, Falstaff speaks to Mrs. Ford in Ford's house. But he has only just begun his latest attempt at seduction before Mrs. Page rushes in. Falstaff hides in another room. Mrs. Page announces that Ford, in another wild fit of jealousy, is on his way over to the house, with a group of friends. Falstaff refuses to go in the basket again, but he cannot leave the house, which is already guarded by three of Ford's brothers. Mrs. Page has the idea of disguising Falstaff, and then he can leave. Mrs. Ford says that her maid's aunt, known as the fat woman of Brainford has a gown upstairs. Falstaff exits to put on the gown, as well as her hat and muffler.
	Mrs. Ford wishes that her husband might find Falstaff in this disguise, since he hates the fat woman of Brainford and has threatened to beat her. Once again, the women are pleased with the success of their joke.
	Mrs. Ford arranges for the servants to be carrying the linen basket when her husband arrives. Sure enough, when Ford arrives, he demands to see what is in the basket, and pulls the clothes out himself. Of course, there is no one in the basket, and Evans, Shallow and Page reproach him, believing him to be mistaken in his jealousy. Ford persuades them to join him in a search of the house.
	Falstaff enters, disguised, with Mrs. Page. Ford is outraged, because he has forbidden the fat woman of Brainford to enter his house. He attacks Falstaff and beats him as he runs away.
	When the men exit, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford express their satisfaction at the beating Falstaff received. They plan to tell their husbands everything, and relish the prospect of Falstaff's public shaming. They also say they will be prepared to teach Falstaff another lesson, if their husbands desire it.
	Analysis
	Once more Falstaff attempts to seduce Mrs. Ford with ridiculously inflated language (scene 2, lines 1-6). But after that the humor, as with the laundry basket scene, is all physical-Falstaff's disguise, the beating he gets from Ford. There is no subtlety about it. There is also, as some commentators have remarked, some repetitiveness about the plotting. At the close of Act 3, Falstaff divulged his plans once again to the disguised Ford, just as he had done in Act 2, scene 2. And in this scene, the jealous Ford once again rushes to his house and searches for the malefactor. The difference of course is that this time he is successful, even though he does not realize that the intruder is Falstaff. Falstaff's punishment is also more severe in this scene than in the earlier one, since being beaten is surely worse than getting drenched in a dirty laundry basket.

Act IV
	Scene 3-4
	In scene 3, Bardolph tells the Host that the Germans who have been staying at the Garter Inn need to have three of his horses, to meet the Duke at court. The Host agrees, but says he will make them pay for the horses.
	In scene 4, Ford, who has been shown the letters Falstaff wrote and how the women responded to them, asks forgiveness of his wife.
	Then Page, Ford, their wives, and Evans plan yet another trick on Falstaff. The women will ask him to meet them in the wood at night, disguised as Herne the Hunter, the spirit of a man who used to be a keeper in the forest. Herne is said to appear with great horns and cause mischief in the wood. When Falstaff comes and meets the women, Anne Page and a few more children will pretend to be fairies and rush at him. The women will run away, and the children will encircle him and pinch him and ask him why he dares to tread on their sacred paths.
	Mrs. Ford suggests that the fairies will continue to pinch him and burn him with tapers until he admits the truth. Then everyone else will appear and mock Falstaff all the way back to Windsor.
	Page plots to allow Slender to marry his daughter immediately after the joke in Windsor forest, while Mrs. Page lays plans to marry Anne off to Caius. She thinks Slender is an idiot, whereas Caius has money, as well as friends at the royal court.
	Analysis
	The horse-stealing described in scene 3 begins a new subplot. Since it emerges so suddenly, is not connected to the main action, and never fully resolves itself, some scholars posit the idea of a ""lost scene"" of the play, in which this sub-plot was resolved. Others have argued that the horse-stealing is a plot hatched by Caius and Evans, who in Act 3, scene I resolve to be revenged on the Host because he has deceived them. But this revenge is never enacted, unless it takes place through this horse-stealing episode.
	The role of wealth and social position in producing a desirable marriage is again emphasized in scene 4, when Mrs. Page says that her daughter will marry Caius because he has money and favor at court. She is determined to stick to her choice even if twenty thousand worthier men come to court Anne.

Act IV
	Scene 5-6
	At the Garter Inn, Simple is looking for the fat woman of Brainford. She is also known as a wise woman, and he has a question to ask her from Slender. Simple asks to see Falstaff, because he has caught sight of him still in his disguise and thinks that the woman is in Falstaff's room. After Falstaff tells the Host that she has gone, Simple tells Falstaff that Slender wanted to ask the wise woman whether he would marry Anne Page. (Apparently the old woman has a reputation as a fortune-teller.) Falstaff gives him a ""wise guy"" answer that doesn't tell him anything, and says he heard it from the old woman herself. Satisfied with this, Simple leaves.
	Bardolph enters with news that the Germans have stolen the Host's horses, but the Host is loathe to believe the worst of his guests. That is, until Evans enters with the information that the Germans have tricked all the innkeepers of the nearby towns of their horses and their money. Caius confirms that there is no duke at the court who goes by the name that the Germans have supplied. Distressed, the Host calls for a hue and cry to catch the thieves. He exits with Bardolph.
	Mistress Quickly enters and says she has come from Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford. Falstaff is in no mood to listen to her, and says he has suffered enough. She says that the women have suffered too, especially Mrs. Ford, who has been badly beaten by her husband. Quickly presents Falstaff with a letter (presumably from Mrs. Ford or Mrs. Page), and he invites her into his room.
	In scene 6, Fenton promises to pay the Host even more money than he has lost if he will cooperate with him. Fenton explains that Anne has been told by her father to slip away from the forest in her disguise as the fairy queen, and go to Eton where she will be immediately be married to Slender. Fenton says that Anne has consented to this plan (which obviously is against her wishes). But Mrs. Page, says Fenton, has other plans. She has arranged for Anne to slip away and be married to Caius, to which plan it appears that Anne has also agreed. Page expects his daughter to be dressed in white in the forest, whereas Mrs. Page expects her to be dressed in green. The color of her clothing is important because that is how the would-be grooms will be able to recognize her. Fenton wants the Host to secure the services of a vicar and to wait at the church, where he intends to bring Anne and marry her.
	Analysis
	Act 4, scene 5 concludes the subplot about the horse-stealers. Although it is not really integrated with the main action of the play, it does have some thematic relevance. Virtually everyone in the play tries at some point to deceive someone else, and yet the deceivers eventually discover that they have also been deceived (this will not become fully apparent until the last Act). The deceit of the Host in this subplot contributes to this theme, since earlier he practiced his own form of deceit (on Caius and Evans).
	In scene 6, Fenton's speeches in blank verse are the longest verse passages in the play. They serve to inform the audience of the plots that will create some of the humor in the last act.

Act V
	Scene 1-5
	Falstaff has agreed to go to the wood, hoping this will be third time lucky. Ford, disguised as Brook, enters, and Falstaff tells him to go to the forest at midnight. He tells Brook about his misadventure disguised as the old woman of Brainford, disparages Ford and promises vengeance on him, and promises that Brook will have Ford's wife.
	In scene 2, on the outskirts of Windsor forest, Page, Shallow and Slender rehearse their plans. Shallow tells Slender that he will recognize Anne by her white garments.
	In scene 3, Mrs. Page tells Caius that her daughter will be dressed in green, and that he should slip away with her whenever a moment presents itself. She knows her husband will be angry, but she thinks that is better than the heartbreak that would ensue if Anne is forced to marry Slender.
	Eagerly anticipating yet another humiliation of Falstaff, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford depart for Windsor Park.
	In scene 4, in the park, Evans leads the children disguised as fairies and tells them to remember their parts.
	In scene 5 Falstaff enters, wearing a buck's head, as he has been instructed. It is just after midnight. Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page enter, and Falstaff embraces Mrs. Ford. He is delighted to hear that Mrs. Page is there also. But then there is the sound of horns, and the women run away.
	Evans enters, dressed like a satyr (a mythical creature, half-man, half-beast), with Anne Page and the children, Pistol dressed as a hobgoblin, and Mistress Quickly dressed like the Queen of Fairies. Quickly and Pistol speak some rhymes addressed to the fairies. Falstaff, believing that anyone who speaks to fairies will die, lies face down and closes his eyes.
	Evans and Quickly recite more verses and then command the fairies to dance around the tree, next to which Falstaff lies. Spotting him, Evans commands the fairies to put their tapers to Falstaff's fingers. He gives a start, and the fairies then dance around him, pinch him and recite a scornful rhyme. While this is going on, Caius steals away with a boy in green; Slender with a boy in white (each thinks he has got Anne Page), while Fenton steals away with Anne. After a noise of hunting is made, the fairies run away.
	Page, Ford and their wives disclose themselves to Falstaff and mock him. He realizes that he has been made a fool of, but this does not stop their mockery. Falstaff resigns himself to enduring their insults.
	Page invites Falstaff to his house for dinner, where he will be able to laugh at Mrs. Page (who is now laughing at him), because she will have found out that her daughter has married Slender (or so Page thinks). In an aside, Mrs. Page discloses that Anne has in fact married Caius (or so she thinks).
	Then Slender enters, distressed. He tells how the person he thought was Anne Page turned out to be a boy. Page rebukes him for making a mess of their plan, but Slender explains that he followed it exactly. Mrs. Page tells her husband not to be angry, and explains that she put her daughter in green to foil his plan, and that Anne is now married to Caius.
	Caius enters, and tells a story just like Slender's. He eloped with a boy, thinking it was Anne.
	Fenton and Anne enter. They are married. Fenton rebukes her parents, saying that they wanted her to marry without love. He and Anne are now united and should not be accused of disobedience, since they married for love. Anne therefore avoided a forced, unhappy marriage. Page forgives them, and his wife follows his example. She invites everyone to their home where they can all laugh at what has happened. Falstaff is invited too, and Ford appears to be ready to forgive him his folly.
	Analysis
	In the final scene, the community of Windsor comes together and overcomes the threat embodied in Falstaff by exposing and ridiculing him. In doing so they reaffirm the moral and social order that governs their lives. Mrs. Page gives the moral of the play in Act 5, scene 3: ""Against such lewdsters and their lechery / Those that betray them do no treachery.""
	But anyone who knows the Henry IV plays will be disappointed to see the great wit and rogue Falstaff laid low in this manner. His abject submission, ""Use me as you will,"" and his comment, ""I am not able to answer,"" could not possibly have been uttered by the Falstaff of the Henry plays, who is never at a loss for words and can talk himself out of any situation.
	If Falstaff is thoroughly humiliated, the other characters do not emerge unscathed either. In the marriage plot concerning Anne Page, the deceivers are themselves deceived, and their materialistic values rebuked. The young lovers, Fenton and Anne, overcome the cold practicalities of middle age. Fenton is like Falstaff in the sense that he too transgressed the social order, since he had no permission to marry Anne, but he asks for and receives forgiveness.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"Summary
	Act 1, scene 1
	Two gentlemen are talking in the palace of Cymbeline, King of Britain. The First Gentleman says that all the courtiers are frowning, reflecting the sorrowful mood of the King. He explains the reason: the King's daughter, Imogen, has married Posthumus Leonatus, a poor but worthy man, against the wishes of her father and his current wife, the Queen. The King has banished Posthumus and imprisoned Imogen. The King and Queen had wanted Imogen to marry Cloten, the Queen's son by a previous husband.
	The First Gentleman says that despite their sad appearance, the courtiers are secretly glad about the marriage, as Cloten is ""too bad for bad report"" (line 17). In contrast, he says Imogen's chosen husband is both outwardly handsome and inwardly good. He is the son of Sicilius, who won military glory fighting for King Cymbeline's father, Tenantius, against the Romans. Sicilius earned the surname Leonatus (lion's whelp) for his bravery. Besides Posthumus, Sicilius also had two other sons, who died in battle, ""with their swords in hand"" (line 36), whereupon Sicilius died of grief. Sicilius' wife was pregnant and died giving birth to Posthumus.
	Since Posthumus was now an orphan, the King took him under his care and brought him up. Posthumus grew to be loved and respected in the court. The First Gentleman says that his virtue is demonstrated by the fact that Imogen, the King's daughter and heir, has chosen him. Imogen is the King's only child. He once had two sons, but twenty years ago, both were stolen from the nursery when the eldest was three and the youngest a baby. The Second Gentleman is surprised that the King's children were so poorly guarded, and the search so slow that it could not trace them.
	The gentlemen end their talk as the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen enter.
	Analysis
	Little is known about the historical Cymbeline, son of Theomantius (Shakespeare calls him Tenantius). He became King of Britain in 33 BC, when it was an outpost of the Roman empire. He reigned for 35 years, leaving two sons, Guiderius and Arvigarus. He was brought up in Rome and was absolved by Augustus Caesar of paying tribute. Subsequently, tribute was demanded and refused, but the chronicler Holinshed, one of Shakespeare's main sources, is unsure whether Cymbeline or some other King refused to pay. Caesar then invaded Britain. Holinshed wrote that British chroniclers claim the Romans were twice defeated in battle, but comments that Latin sources claimed ultimate victory for the Romans. Shakespeare, for the purposes of his play, has Cymbeline refuse to pay the tribute.
	The play's first scene is an expository one in that it gives the background to the story and tells us something about the main characters. It sets up a stark contrast between Imogen's two suitors: the Queen's son Cloten, an unworthy man, and the King's ward, Posthumus, as virtuous as he is attractive.
	It also introduces two major themes of the play. The first is outward appearance (the courtiers' sad faces) versus inward truth (their happiness at Imogen's marriage to Posthumus). At court, the two are at odds, leading to a hypocritical atmosphere. Related to this theme is outward nobility of birth (which Cloten has), which is not earned and which can be superficial, versus inward nobility of character (which Posthumus has), which must be earned and runs deep. Imogen, who is both well-born and appreciates true goodness, unites both. However, in her decision to marry the poor but worthy Posthumus, she has initiated a conflict with her parents, who are unable to see beyond his undistinguished birth.
	The disappearance of the King's sons carries intense symbolic importance. The Romance tradition of literature often featured a king who was wounded or disabled in some way. When the king, the symbolic head of a nation, was sick, his country was sick too: crops failed, disease and famine thrived. The hero of the story went on a quest to find the regenerative ""cure"" for the king's ailment and, by extension, his country. In this tradition, to which all Shakespeare's Romance plays (A Winter's Tale, The Tempest, Pericles and Cymbeline) belong, the cure is often found by someone from the younger generation, which represents regeneration, fertility, and vigorous new life.
	In Cymbeline, the fact that the King has lost his sons leaves him cut off from this life-giving quality. Only Imogen is left of the younger generation, but the King has rejected her. Severed from the regenerative root, the King and his court are left to wither and decay in destructive emotions like resentment and revenge. Through reference to the Romance tradition, we expect that Cymbeline's cure will involve being reunited with his sons and reconciled with Imogen.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"Summary
	The Queen tells Imogen that she is no wicked stepmother in that she supports her in her decision. She will have Imogen set free and speak in favor of Posthumus to the King. But she advises Posthumus to comply with the King's sentence of banishment. Posthumus agrees to leave today. The Queen leaves the newly-wed couple alone ""in pity"" of their state, in spite of the King's orders that they should not speak together.
	Imogen tells Posthumus that the Queen is only pretending to be on their side. She has braced herself to stay and face her father's anger, and sorrowfully urges Posthumus to leave. Posthumus, moved by Imogen's grief, pledges his loyalty to her. He will go to Rome and stay with his father's friend Philario.
	The Queen re-enters and advises the couple to be brief as she is at risk of angering the King. In a sinister aside to the audience, she reveals that she is sure of winning the King over to her way of thinking, since he always submits to the wrongs she does him in order to keep her friendship.
	Left alone with Posthumus, Imogen gives him a diamond ring, which belonged to her mother. She asks him to keep it until he woos another wife, after she herself is dead. He protests that he only wants one wife - Imogen - and that he would die sooner than take another. He puts the ring on her finger and also gives her a bracelet to wear for his sake.
	As Imogen wonders when they will meet again, Cymbeline comes in, furious to see Posthumus still there. Posthumus leaves with a blessing on ""the good remainders of the court"" (line 60). The King then charges Imogen with disloyalty, but Imogen advises him not to harm himself with his wrath; she is senseless of it, since parting from her husband is a greater pain. He accuses her of bringing ""baseness"" on his throne by taking a ""beggar"" for her husband; she insists that she has added ""lustre"" to it (line 74). She points out that it is Cymbeline's fault that she loves Posthumus, as Cymbeline brought them up together, and adds that Posthumus is ""a man worth any woman"" (line 77).
	As the Queen enters, Cymbeline scolds her for disobeying his command and allowing the couple to meet. The Queen asks the King to leave her with them, which he does.
	Pisanio, Posthumus's servant, comes in and tells the Queen that her son Cloten has drawn his sword on Posthumus. Posthumus was not incited to anger and did not try to hurt Cloten; others parted them. Imogen wishes they had been in some lonely place and that the fight had been concluded, presumably with the destruction of Cloten. Posthumus has sent Pisanio back to serve Imogen. Imogen asks him to come and see her in half an hour's time.
	Analysis
	The King is consumed by anger that his ambitions for his daughter have been thwarted, and the Queen is engaged in scheming for her own selfish ends. It is left to the young couple, Imogen and Posthumus, to act from a basis of love and selflessness. Our sympathies are with them, and this is reinforced by Posthumus's generous treatment of Cloten, whom he avoids harming in a fight even though Cloten was the aggressor.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is developed further. Imogen refers to the Queen's ""dissembling courtesy"" (line 15), as she sees that the Queen is really self-serving underneath her pretended support for the newly-wed couple. The Queen reveals her hypocritical nature in an aside which tells the audience that she plays upon the King's emotions for her own ends (lines 35-7).
	The contrast between outward rank and inward worth is brought home in Cymbeline's accusation that Posthumus is a base ""beggar"" since he is low-born, whereas Imogen protests his true worth.
	It is worth noting in this scene that Imogen wishes that she were a goatherd's daughter, and Posthumus a shepherd's son. The theme of the innocence and purity of the countryside and its dwellers contrasted with the corruption of the court is a traditional one of Romance plays.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 3,"Summary
	The First Lord advises Cloten to change his shirt, which smells as a result of his fighting with Posthumus, though the Lord, in an attempt to flatter Cloten, tries unconvincingly to suggest that it is the air outside Cloten's shirt that is unwholesome. Cloten only sees the need to change his shirt if it were bloody, and asks if Posthumus is hurt. The Second Lord reveals in an aside to the audience that he is not, but the First Lord tries to flatter Cloten by saying it would be remarkable if Posthumus were not hurt. The Second Lord continues to address the audience in asides revealing Cloten's cowardice and Posthumus's bravery in the fight. Cloten claims he wishes the onlookers had not parted them, and the Second Lord says in an aside that he wishes Posthumus had killed Cloten.
	Cloten is astonished that Imogen could prefer Posthumus to himself. The First lord replies that her beauty exceeds her intelligence.
	Analysis
	The Second Lord echoes Imogen's wish in the previous scene that Posthumus had killed Cloten. This sets up an expectation that Cloten may indeed be disposed of. The contrast between the First Lord's flattering remarks to Cloten and the Second Lord's contempt for him, expressed in asides to the audience, reveal the hypocrisy and underlying discontent at court, where people say one thing but think another. Such disunity in Shakespeare indicates an unsustainable situation, since if truth is to prevail, that which is false must be destroyed.
	Cloten's vanity and lack of self-knowledge are plain in this, our first sight of him. Cloten speaks in prose, revealing his unrefined nature, whereas Imogen and Posthumus address each other in blank verse, as befits their more refined characters. Cloten also smells bad, which in Shakespeare is a sure sign of an uncivilized nature.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 4,"Summary
	Imogen questions Pisanio about his last sight of Posthumus and hopes he will write. Posthumus's final words were about Imogen as he unwillingly sailed away from her. Imogen regrets that she did not have time to say all that she had wanted to her husband - her worries that Posthumus would be tempted away from her by Italian women, and her desire that he should think of her at certain pre-arranged time - before Cymbeline came in and interrupted them.
	A lady enters and tells Imogen that the Queen wishes to see her.
	Analysis
	The love between the young couple is reinforced by Pisanio's account of Posthumus's actions on leaving.
	The language of the seasons and nature's cycles runs through all the Romance plays. Here, Imogen likens her father's interruption of her meeting with Posthumus to the ""tyrannous breathing of the north"" that ""shakes all our buds from growing"" (lines 36-7). The young lovers embody the regenerative and life-giving warm spring season (the previous scene, Act 1, scene 3, line 31, already implied that Imogen was like the sun), whereas Cymbeline represents the chill north wind that prevents the growth of their love.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 5,"Summary
	The scene is set in Rome at the house of Philario, where Posthumus intends to stay. Iachimo, a friend of Philario's, is speaking cynically about Posthumus, whom he has seen on a trip to Britain. He hints that he may not be as worthy as he is popularly believed to be. Philario replies that Posthumus has since grown in worth ""both without and within"" (line 10). Iachimo suggests that his marriage to the King's daughter gives him a reputation he does not deserve, and that people would rather exaggerate Posthumus's goodness than question Imogen's judgment for ""taking a beggar"" (line 24). He asks Philario why Posthumus is staying with him. Philario explains that he and Posthumus's father Sicilius were soldiers together, and that Sicilius saved his life.
	Posthumus arrives and Philario introduces him to the others present-Iachimo, a Frenchman and a Dutchman. The Frenchman reminds Posthumus that he has met him before, at Orleans, where he made peace between Posthumus and another Frenchman when they were about to fight over a trivial matter. Posthumus protests that the matter was not trivial. Iachimo inquires what it was, and the Frenchman explains that Posthumus had maintained that his lover, Imogen, was more beautiful, chaste and virtuous than any woman in France. Iachimo sneers that either the lady or Posthumus's opinion must not still exist. Posthumus protests that both her virtue and his opinion hold. Iachimo extends the quarrel, saying Posthumus cannot set her above Italian women. Posthumus will not give ground.
	Iachimo introduces a comparison between Posthumus's wife and his diamond. It may be, he says, that the diamond outshines many others that he has seen, but he has not seen the most precious diamond in existence, and neither has Posthumus seen the best woman in existence. When Posthumus says he values his diamond as more precious than any other, Iachimo wrongly implies that he prizes his diamond above Imogen. But Posthumus sets him right, pointing out that Imogen cannot be bought or sold, and is ""only the gift of the gods"" (line 88). Iachimo suggests that of Posthumus's two priceless things, the diamond ring and Imogen, the one could be stolen and the second is ""frail"" (line 94); both are vulnerable to thieves. Posthumus replies that Italy contains no courtier accomplished enough to convince Imogen to betray him, and neither does he fear the loss of his ring.
	Iachimo issues a challenge to Posthumus: he says he could get the better of Imogen's-or any woman's-virtue ""even to the yielding,"" an expression that implies sexual as well as military surrender. He wagers half his estate against Posthumus's ring that he will prevail. Posthumus refuses, saying that Iachimo deserves punishment.
	Philario intervenes, asking them to forget their disagreement. Iachimo now wishes he had extended his wager to include his neighbor's estate. He suggests a bet of ten thousand ducats against Posthumus's ring that, given an introduction to the court where Imogen lives, he will defeat her honor and bring back proof. Posthumus agrees to the wager with the addition that if Iachimo prevails, he will not treat him as an enemy, since Imogen will not be worth the debate. But if Imogen refuses to be seduced, then for the insult Iachimo has offered to her chastity, Posthumus will fight him. Iachimo agrees and says they will have a legal agreement drawn up.
	Analysis
	Philario says he is happy to let Posthumus's true worth speak for itself, rather than praise him unnecessarily: such is his confidence in the reality of his goodness. In Posthumus's case, there is no difference between appearance and reality.
	Iachimo, in contrast, who cynically judges all men by his own debased standards, tries to suggest that Posthumus's reputation is not deserved and that he borrows any perceived worth from his marriage with the King's daughter. His attitude is a veiled warning that he will try to prove his mean estimation of Posthumus to be true-that he will attempt to bring him down to his own base level.
	Iachimo's military metaphors are worth noting. He says that popular praise of Posthumus is calculated to ""fortify"" Imogen's questionable judgment, which is so weak it would fall before an ""easy battery"" (lines 21-3). He is confident that his conversation could ""get ground of"" Imogen (line 108) and make her yield-military terms for driving an enemy into retreat and making them surrender. This says much about his world view: to him, good people are enemies to be vanquished.
	Iachimo's skill in making mischief is clearly portrayed in this scene. On hearing that Posthumus was previously willing to fight to defend his lady's virtue, he realizes that this is a sensitive area where Posthumus is vulnerable to attack. He quickly divines the things that are most precious to Posthumus (Imogen and the diamond she has given him), and attempts to equate the two by suggesting that Imogen can be stolen as easily as the diamond.
	This scene makes use of images of buying, selling, and worth, a major theme in the play. The cynical Iachimo implies (line 15) that as a poor man, Posthumus's worth is only borrowed from the King's daughter, that he is ""weighed rather by her value than his own."" Also, Posthumus and Iachimo discuss in detail what Imogen, and Posthumus's diamond, are worth.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 6,"Summary
	At Cymbeline's palace, the Queen is giving instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground. Then she asks the doctor, Cornelius, whether he has brought the drugs. He presents a box to her, but his conscience prompts him to ask why she requires these slow but deadly poisons. Annoyed at being questioned, she replies that while the doctor has trained her in the herbal arts of distilling and making perfumes, she wants to extend her skill by testing these compounds on non-human subjects - by implication, animals. Cornelius is not impressed, and points out that she will only harden her heart.
	The Queen ends the conversation abruptly and Pisanio enters. In an aside, the Queen reveals her intention to try her poisons first on him, as he is on Posthumus's side and an ""enemy"" to her son in the question of Imogen. As she dismisses Cornelius, he remarks in an aside that he knows of her malice, and will ensure that she does no harm. The drugs he has given her are not the deadly poisons she requested, but potions to ""stupefy and dull the sense awhile."" She will try them on cats and dogs, and later humans, but the effect will be merely to lock up the spirits temporarily, only for the subject to awaken refreshed.
	The Queen hopes Imogen's affections for Posthumus will cool. She promises Pisanio that when he brings her word that Imogen loves Cloten, she will make him as great as his master, Posthumus. In fact, he will be greater, as Posthumus cannot return; neither can Posthumus provide for Pisanio.
	The Queen then drops the box, and Pisanio picks it up. The Queen urges him to take it as a token of further favors she intends to him, claiming she has five times saved the King's life with its contents. She orders Pisanio to tell Imogen what she must do (presumably, to renounce Posthumus and marry Cloten). She reminds him that if he brings about her desire, he will still have his mistress, Imogen, and Cloten also to give him preferment. In addition, she will persuade the King to grant whatever he wishes, and she herself will be obligated to reward him.
	Pisanio leaves without responding, and the Queen reveals that she mistrusts him, as she believes he is still loyal to Posthumus and Imogen. She says if he takes what she believes to be poison, Imogen will have no supporters. If Imogen continues to defy the Queen, she too will be given poison, leaving Cloten as heir to Cymbeline's throne. Pisanio re-enters to reveal to the audience that he would rather choke himself than prove untrue to Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The Queen's instructions to pick flowers while the dew is on the ground has sinister significance. Belarius, at Act 4, scene 2, lines 284-5, comments that ""The herbs that have on them cold dew o'th'night / Are strewings fitt'st for graves."" Herbalists advised that medicinal herbs should be picked when dried by the sun, since dewy herbs would rot quickly and would therefore be less wholesome and unsuitable for healing. The Queen, obsessed with poisoning people who stand in her way, wants to put the flowers to an evil use, which stands in contrast to the life-affirming floral imagery surrounding the young lovers. This is part of the play's theme of the regenerative role of the younger generation contrasted with the destructive and decaying role of the older generation.
	The theme of appearance versus reality is presented with a twist in the doctor's determination to be true to mankind in general by being false with the Queen: by his lie about the effects of the herbs he has given her, he will save her intended victims from poison.
	The Queen's treachery and deceit is contrasted with the loyalty and integrity of Pisanio and Cornelius.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 7,"Summary
	Imogen is lamenting her unhappy situation, and wishes she had been stolen like her brothers. Pisanio enters with Iachimo, introducing him as a gentleman from Rome who has brought letters from Posthumus, who is safe. In an aside, Iachimo praises Imogen's beauty and admits that if her mind is as admirable, he has lost his wager.
	Posthumus, in his letter, asks Imogen to treat Iachimo well in return for his ""kindnesses"" to Posthumus (line 23). She welcomes him. Iachimo appears to be wonder-struck by Imogen's beauty, and muses aloud how anyone could fail to distinguish between fair and foul. He seems to imply, without actually saying it outright, that there is another woman whom, in spite of her obvious inferiority (""sluttery,"" line 44), Posthumus is driven by lust to prefer to Imogen.
	Imogen is mystified but changes the subject, asking after Posthumus's health and state of mind. Iachimo takes his chance to blacken Posthumus's character further, saying he is so merry that he is called ""the Briton reveller"". Imogen says he is more usually inclined to sadness; Iachimo replies that he has never seen Posthumus sad. On the contrary, he says, he laughs at a Frenchman who is pining after his girlfriend at home, for wasting time in such ""bondage."" He suggests that Posthumus is abusing his God-given bounty (both his own talents and his wife), and says he pities them. Posthumus neglects his ""sun"" (Imogen) and takes solace in a dungeon by the light of a burned-out candle, a a reference, perhaps, to a sordid and secretive place or to the worn-out slut whom he alleges Posthumus meets there.
	Imogen asks Iachimo to speak more openly, as she would rather know the truth. Iachimo protests that if he had a woman such as Imogen, he would never pursue common prostitutes. Imogen is worried, saying that her husband ""has forgot Britain"" (line 113). Iachimo says Posthumus is forcing her to live a nun-like life while he is living a sexually promiscuous life on her money. He urges her to revenge and dedicates himself to her ""sweet pleasure"" (line 136), saying that unlike Posthumus, he will be loyal to her.
	He tries to kiss Imogen, but this action prompts her to see Iachimo for what he is. She calls for Pisanio, and rejects Iachimo's advance, reproaching herself for listening to him. His motivation, she says, was not virtuous but self-seeking, to obtain her for himself. She says he has wronged Posthumus and that she will tell her father of his assault.
	Iachimo rapidly changes direction, protesting that his aim was only to test her loyalty to Posthumus, and that he did so out of love to him. He begs her to forgive him, which she does.
	Iachimo then asks Imogen to store a trunk containing expensive plate and jewels which he, Posthumus and some other friends have jointly bought as a gift for the Roman Emperor. She agrees, and as Posthumus has an interest in them, says she will keep them in her bedroom. Iachimo says he will have them sent to her just for tonight, as he must leave tomorrow. She tries to persuade Iachimo to stay, but he cannot. He suggests that she write Posthumus a letter tonight so that he can return with it tomorrow.
	Analysis
	Iachimo's base nature is displayed in his use of animal imagery (lines 39-50). Apes, he says, would discriminate better than Posthumus does between Imogen and the imaginary ""slut."" He likens Posthumus to a predator which devours first the lamb (Imogen) but, still hungry, wants to feed on ""garbage.""
	Iachimo's description of Posthumus in exile as ""the Briton reveler"" is calculated to upset Imogen and make her suspicious of her husband's loyalty. He uses images of rot, decay, disease and poison to excite disgust at Posthumus's supposed life of whoring: ""Such boil'd stuff / As well might poison poison!"" (line 126) is thought to refer to the sweating treatment given to people suffering from venereal disease. Note that he also tries to set Imogen against Posthumus by accusing Posthumus of going whoring on her money, a continuation the theme of buying and selling.
	Iachimo's dedication of himself to Imogen's ""sweet pleasure"" may be taken to mean he will do what she wishes by way of helping her take revenge, or may be a seduction attempt. Probably, it carries both meanings. His mind constantly runs along animalistic and sexual tracks, debasing the love relationship between Posthumus and Imogen.
	The rapidity with which Iachimo changes track once Imogen sees through him, and appeals to her naturally open nature, indicates his great skill in manipulating people. Imogen's willingness to forgive Iachimo contrasts markedly with her father's failure to forgive her for marrying against his wishes.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 1,"Summary
	Cloten is playing bowls with some Lords and losing. A Lord asks Cloten if he knows of the Italian visitor to court, Iachimo, a friend of Posthumus's. Cloten does not, and goes to seek him out. The Second Lord, left alone, marvels ""That such a crafty devil as is his mother / Should yield the world this ass!"" (lines 54-5). She is a woman who ""Bears all down with her brain,"" whereas Cloten cannot take two from twenty. The Lord pities Imogen for her unhappy position between her father ruled by her stepmother, the stepmother ""hourly coining plots"" (line 61), and a hateful suitor who wants to divorce her from her husband. He prays that Imogen holds firm.
	Analysis
	This scene adds little to the action of the play, and much of the dialogue is of poor quality, leading some critics to suspect that it is not Shakespeare's but has been interpolated by an unknown hand. Its main function seems to be to further expose Cloten's unrefined nature, to compare his stupidity with his mother's cunning, and to establish that he did not know of Iachimo's presence at court.

	The scene is set in Imogen's bedroom. Iachimo's trunk is placed in it. After she goes to sleep, Iachimo emerges from the trunk. He is tempted by her beauty, but resists the urge to touch and kiss her. His plan is to note details of the room and identifying marks on her body, in order to convince Posthumus that he has succeeded in seducing her. He removes her bracelet, the parting gift from her husband, which he says will help in the ""madding"" of Posthumus (line 37). He also notes a mole on her left breast. When he feels he has enough evidence, he gets back into the trunk.
	Analysis
	The atmosphere of sexual menace in this scene is palpable. Iachimo, leaning over the sleeping and defenseless Imogen and noting the intimate details of her body, is committing a kind of rape, a psychological violation of the marriage between her and Posthumus. This notion is reinforced by the book she has been reading (probably Ovid's Metamorphoses), which tells of treason and rape. Iachimo appears to liken himself to a raven (line 49), a continuation of the predator and prey imagery that runs through the play. His line ""Though this is a heavenly angel, hell is here"" (line 50) leaves no doubt as to the depraved state of Iachimo's soul as compared with that of Imogen.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 2 Scene 3,"Summary
	Cloten is playing some Lords, either at dice or cards, and losing again. Some musicians enter; Cloten has employed them to serenade Imogen, which they do.
	The King and Queen enter. Cymbeline inquires whether Imogen has come out of her room. When Cloten says she has not, Cymbeline says that in time, Imogen will forget Posthumus and then she will be Cloten's. The Queen advises him to obey Imogen in everything except when she sends him away.
	A messenger announces that some ambassadors from Rome, including one called Lucius, have arrived. Cymbeline knows that Rome is angry with him, but he will receive Lucius, who is a worthy man, according to the honor of the Emperor. He asks Cloten to greet Imogen and then to follow him and the Queen to meet the Roman.
	Cloten, left alone, plans to bribe one of Imogen's ladies to buy access to her. Gold can do anything, he says, even have an honest man killed and save a thief.
	He knocks at Imogen's door. A Lady emerges, and Cloten offers her gold to speak for him. Imogen enters. She tells Cloten that she does not care for him, and indeed, she hates him. Cloten says she owes her father obedience. Because of her royal status, she does not have free choice and cannot marry a ""base slave."" Imogen angrily defends her husband, saying that Cloten, even if he were the god Jupiter's son, would be ""too base / To be his groom"" (lines 127-8).
	Imogen calls Pisanio and send him to ask one of her ladies to search for her bracelet. She is sure that she had it last night, because she kissed it.
	Cloten is offended by Imogen's statement that Posthumus's ""meanest garment"" is dearer to her than Cloten, and threatens to tell her father. Imogen suggests he tell the Queen too, and is in no doubt that she will think the worst of her. Cloten vows revenge.
	Analysis
	Cloten employs lewd imagery when talking of Imogen (lines 14-15): ""penetrate,"" ""fingering"" and ""try with tongue too"" are ostensibly about music but have sexual double meanings. The delicate song that follows Cloten's lewd speech, ""Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings, / And Phoebus gins arise,"" reflects the split between the superficially civilized surface and the brutally vulgar. The inappropriateness of Cloten's attitude to Imogen is underscored by his own reference to her ladies as ""Diana's rangers"" (line 70), Diana being the goddess of chastity.
	Cloten's plan to use gold to bribe Imogen's ladies is significant, as Imogen has previously (Act 1, scene 2, line 74) used the imagery of gold to convey the true worth of Posthumus. Gold is traditionally seen as the incorruptible metal, as it does not tarnish, but Cloten wants to use it to corrupt innocence.
	There is profound irony in Imogen's hope that her bracelet has not gone to tell Posthumus that she is kissing something or someone other than him, since we know, where Imogen does not, that Iachimo plans to use this bracelet as proof that she is unfaithful.
	Imogen's steadfastness comes across in this scene, as she fearlessly defends herself and Posthumus against Cloten's onslaught.

Summary
	In Rome, Posthumus tells Philario he is sure of Imogen's honor, but has less confidence that he will win over the King. He is leaving it to time. In his exiled state, he regrets he cannot repay Philario for his generosity. But Philario says that Posthumus's goodness and company are payment enough. Besides, he is confident that Lucius, Augustus Caesar's ambassador, will by now have extracted the tribute arrears that he went to collect from Cymbeline. If Cymbeline does not pay up, he will face a Roman invasion.
	Posthumus believes that Cymbeline will not pay and that there will be war. He points out that the Britons are more skilled in war than they were in Julius Caesar's day, when the Roman invaders defeated them.
	Iachimo enters, commends Imogen's beauty to Posthumus, and gives him letters from her. Posthumus asks Iachimo whether his diamond still sparkles as brightly, or is dimmed by Imogen's betrayal. Iachimo replies that he has won the ring, for he enjoyed a night with the ""easy"" Imogen. Posthumus, reluctant to believe Iachimo, warns him not to joke about his losing the bet, and reminds him that they shall not remain friends. Iachimo answers that they will remain friends, since he has defeated Imogen's honor and not wronged her or Posthumus-both were willing participants.
	Posthumus asks for proof that he has ""tasted her in bed"" (line 57). Iachimo describes the furnishings of Imogen's bedroom, the carvings over the fireplace, and even the fire-irons, but Posthumus says he could have heard this from someone else.
	Finally, Iachimo shows Posthumus Imogen's bracelet that he stole from her as she slept. He says it matches the diamond, so both must be his. He claims that Imogen gave it to him, saying ""she priz'd it once"" (line 104). Posthumus suggests that maybe she took it off to send it to him, but Iachimo asks if she says that in her letter, which, of course, she does not.
	Posthumus now believes Iachimo. He takes off his ring, which he says has become a basilisk to his eye (a basilisk was a mythical reptile whose glance was thought to be fatal). He rails against the falseness of women underneath their outward beauty, and the worthlessness of their vows.
	Philario counsels him to be patient and take back his ring, as there is no proof that Imogen is unfaithful. It could be that she lost the bracelet, or that one of her ladies stole it.
	Posthumus agrees, and asks for his ring back from Iachimo. He now wants Iachimo to cite some distinguishing feature on Imogen's body as proof. Iachimo swears by Jupiter that he had it from her arm, which again convinces Posthumus that his wife is unfaithful. He is sure she would not lose it, and her ladies are honorable. Posthumus is once more convinced that she has been unfaithful, and gives the ring back to Iachimo. Philario warns him again that the evidence is not strong enough to convince. But Iachimo describes the mole under Imogen's breast, which he says he kissed. Posthumus says that this ""stain"" confirms another-on her character-""as big as hell can hold"" (line 140).
	Posthumus erupts in fury and threatens to tear Imogen limb from limb in front of her father. Philario and Iachimo follow him out to prevent him from harming himself.
	Posthumus re-enters and delivers a soliloquy against women. He regrets that men need them at all, and says all men are bastards: even he does not know where his father was when he was conceived. His mother seemed chaste, but then so does his wife. He attributes all vices in men to the feminine aspect or ""woman's part"" (line 174): lying, deceiving, ambition, and so on. Even to vice, he says, they are not constant, but ever changing.
	Analysis
	Posthumus uses the imagery of the seasons in his hope that the King will be won over to his marriage. Now, he quakes in the wintry cold of the King's displeasure, but wishes for warmer days (lines 5-6).
	Having failed to persuade Imogen to betray her marriage to Posthumus, Iachimo attempts to persuade Posthumus to betray Imogen, by believing that she is faithless.
	Once again, Iachimo chooses his words for maximum emotional impact. He describes the hangings in Imogen's room as telling the story of Antony and Cleopatra (line 70). Just as Antony was Cleopatra's Roman, hints Iachimo, so was he Imogen's.
	Posthumus's surrender to Iachimo's slanders is marked by his sudden inability to distinguish between appearance and reality. He believes that he is at last seeing the truth when he paints Imogen as being outwardly beautiful but inwardly deceitful. In fact, we know that she is beautiful both inside and out, as was Posthumus prior to his corruption by Iachimo. Posthumus's vision has become delusional.
	There is a contrast between Posthumus's delusion and Cymbeline's. Posthumus's wife is honest but he thinks her false; and Cymbeline's wife is deceitful but he chooses to assume that she is honest. Imogen is the only major character who sees everyone as they are. Yet she suffers cruelly as the victim of others' delusions and dishonesty.
	While Posthumus is undoubtedly a victim of Iachimo's evil, it is clear that he is also a flawed character whose one weakness-an insecurity over his wife's fidelity-is exploited. It is ironic that he is more ready to believe in the incorruptible honor of Imogen's ladies (line 125) than in that of his wife.
	Posthumus takes on board Iachimo's imagery of hell (Act 2, scene 3, line 50) when he refers to Imogen's mole being a stain ""as big as hell can hold"" (Act 2, scene 4, line 140). His final soliloquy against women is as shocking as it is unjust, and must strain the audience's sympathy with him.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"Summary
	At Cymbeline's palace, Lucius is asking Cymbeline to honor the three thousand pounds a year tribute agreed with Cymbeline's uncle when Julius Caesar conquered Britain. The Queen says it will never be paid. Cloten adds that it is unlikely that there will be another Caesar like Julius; Britain is ""a world by itself,"" and its people will not pay ""for wearing our own noses."" The Queen urges the King not to pay, on the grounds that Britain is a natural fortress, protected by the sea on all sides, and even Julius Caesar was twice defeated before his final victory over the Britons. Cloten says that Britain is stronger than it was at that time. Unless Caesar ""can hide the sun from us with a blanket"", in which case Britons would pay him a tribute for light, they do not see why they should pay. Cymbeline says that Julius Caesar's ambition enabled him to dominate Britain, but it befits a warlike people to throw off the yoke.
	Lucius, on behalf of Augustus Caesar, declares war on Britain.
	Analysis
	Confirming the Queen's earlier statement that she is always able to win the King to her way of thinking, Cymbeline takes a back seat to the Queen in the talks with Lucius, at one point asking Cloten to stop talking and let her finish. This would have been seen as an unnatural departure from the proper order in Shakespeare's time, because Cymbeline is the sovereign monarch and because he is male. In spite of the fact that England was then being ruled by a woman (Elizabeth I), it was generally believed that men, not women, were created to govern countries, and that within a marriage, men should govern their wives.
	Even Cloten speaks more forcefully in this scene than Cymbeline. The fact that it is the Queen and her unintelligent son who are leading the opposition to the Romans does not inspire confidence in the outcome of the war.

	Pisanio is reading a letter from Posthumus revealing that he accuses Imogen of adultery. A liar has prevailed over Posthumus's ""too ready hearing,"" and Imogen is ""punish'd for her truth"" (lines 6-7). Pisanio observes that Posthumus's mind, compared with Imogen, has sunk to the level of his fortune.
	Posthumus asks Pisanio to murder Imogen. He shall have the opportunity when he delivers a letter to her. If to do so is to do good service, says Pisanio, then he shall not be counted a good servant; he will disobey the order and not tell Imogen of it.
	Imogen enters and Pisanio gives her a letter from Posthumus, which she reads. He writes that he will brave her father's wrath in order to be restored by seeing her. He is at Milford Haven, and hints that she must follow her heart's prompting (presumably, to go there). Imogen is immediately excited by the thought of going to see Posthumus, and asks how long it will take to ride there. Pisanio is less enthusiastic, because he fears that she is riding to her destruction. But she insists that the only way forward for her is to go to Milford Haven and Posthumus.
	Analysis
	Pisanio uses the imagery of disease (""strange infection"") and poison to express Posthumus's unwarranted jealousy (lines 3, 5). But he makes clear that Posthumus's being a victim of such onslaughts does not absolve him of responsibility: Iachimo has simply ""prevail'd / On thy too ready hearing"" (lines 5-6).
	Pisanio has followed Cornelius in disobeying his master for a virtuous purpose. Both Posthumus and the Queen have divorced themselves from truth, and in such cases, the true servant must prevent them from doing evil, if necessary by disobeying orders.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 3,"Summary
	The scene shifts to a cave in Wales, where Belarius, a banished Lord, is out hunting with his adopted sons. These are, in fact, Cymbeline's lost sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, though they are going under the names of Polydore and Cadwal.
	Belarius contrasts the pride and vanity of the court with the poorer but ""nobler"" (line 22) life they have had to adopt. The humble beetle, he says, lives safer than the grand eagle. At the court, people are reliant on others for approval and live in debt to their tailors. Guiderius points out that while Belarius has the luxury of comparing the two lifestyles, he and his brother do not, since they have never been away from this place. To them, the cave is merely a ""cell of ignorance"" (line 33) and a prison. Arviragus adds that unlike Belarius, they will have no tales to tell when they grow as old as him: they have seen nothing, and are like foxes or wolves, concerned only with hunting their next meal. The only courage they need is to ""chase what flies"" (line 42), a cowardly sort of valor.
	Belarius tells them that there is nothing to be desired in the life of the court, where a climb to the peak of favor will be followed by a fall into disgrace, and where the fear of falling is as bad as the fact. Honorable acts are often punished, and what is worse, you must bow (""court'sey"") in thanks for such treatment. He himself was once loved by Cymbeline, but overnight, he lost favor after being slandered by two false villains. They told Cymbeline he was collaborating with the Romans, and he was banished.
	He promises his adopted sons that the first to hit a deer shall be lord of the feast and that the others will serve him. And, he says, he will fear no poison, which is an occupational hazard at court.
	After the boys leave, Belarius muses how difficult it is to hide ""the sparks of Nature"" (line 79) inherent in the sons of a king. This is in spite of the fact that they have not been told of their royal birth (believing that they are Belarius's sons), and that Cymbeline is unaware that they are alive. When Belarius tells Guiderius, heir to Cymbeline, of his warlike feats, the boy acts out his words and ""The princely blood flows in his cheek"" (line 93).
	Belarius, who goes under the name of Morgan, says that Cymbeline banished him unjustly. In revenge, he stole the royal children in order to deprive the king of his heirs, just as he had been deprived of his lands. But now, ""the game is up,"" by which he probably means that the pretence cannot be kept up any longer.
	Analysis
	Belarius contrasts the low door of his cave, where his exiled family must bow their heads as if to worship the heavens, with the high gates of monarchs, where giants can strut through, keeping their turbans on. He is symbolically making the point that the court is a place of pride, whereas they have learned humility. But paradoxically, their life is nobler than a court life, which is marked by dependence, debt and vanity.
	However, this scene offers a twist on the conventional view of country life offered by Romance plays. It may be more innocent and less corrupt than court life, but to Guiderius and Arviragus, it is as limiting as a prison and as bestial as the existence of a wolf or a fox.
	In comparing himself and his brother to baby birds who have never flown the nest (lines 26-7), Guiderius continues the imagery of birds that permeates the play. Posthumus is represented as an eagle in Act 1, scene 2; and Iachimo, in Act 1, scene 7, calls Imogen ""alone th' Arabian bird,"" a reference to the legendary Phoenix. The Phoenix is said to have risen from its own ashes, out of the fire which burned at the top of the sacred Persea Tree at Heliopolis. It was a symbol of the rising sun and of the dead Sun-god, Osiris, from whom it sprang, and to whom it was sacred. The image foreshadows Imogen's later 'rebirth' from her seeming death.
	Belarius's story of how he fell from favor as a result of slanders echoes Imogen's fall from Posthumus's favor as a result of Iachimo's lies, as well as Posthumus's fall from Cymbeline's favor after he married Imogen.
	The scene illustrates the belief, prevalent in Shakespeare's time, that royal blood cannot be hidden, but will show itself through an inherent nobility of thought and action. Though the roof of his cave is low, the boys' thoughts ""do hit / The roofs of palaces"" (line 83), and they enter into Belarius's war stories in ""princely"" fashion (line 93).

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 4,"Summary
	Pisanio and Imogen are on their way to Milford Haven to meet Posthumus, as Imogen thinks. Pisanio is disturbed about leading Imogen to her death. When Imogen questions his obvious anxiety, he hands Posthumus's letter to her, in which Posthumus orders him to kill Imogen at Milford Haven for her proven adultery. Imogen asks what it means to be false to his bed: to think of him all the time, and be awakened by frightening dreams about the dangers he is in? She realizes that it is Iachimo who has been false; she suspects too that some loose Italian woman has led Posthumus astray. She herself is like a discarded garment, no longer in fashion, that must be ripped to pieces (line 53). Posthumus will bring all good seeming things into disrepute, as if they were pretended for evil purposes.
	She draws Pisanio's sword and orders him to take it and kill her in accordance with Posthumus's order; she asks him to tell Posthumus later of her obedience. Pisanio refuses and tosses the sword aside. She tells him he must obey his master, and she cannot kill herself as suicide is a sin. Imogen's insistence that Pisanio kill her, as suicide is a sin, triggers a series of religious images. She throws away Posthumus's letters as ""heresy"" (line 82); he is one of the ""false teachers"" of heresy (line 85). She points out that her disobedience against her father in marrying Posthumus was very unusual; she is obedient to his order that she die. She feels sad to think how, when he is tired of his new woman, he will miss her. She asks Pisanio not to delay, since both she and Posthumus want her death.
	Pisanio refuses to kill Imogen, and she asks why he has therefore wasted so much time and trouble traveling all these miles. Pisanio answers that he only wanted to win time to find a way out of his situation.
	He is sure that ""some villain"" (line 121) has abused Posthumus into thinking Imogen is unfaithful. Imogen asks whether this could be a Roman courtesan, but Pisanio says no. He plans to announce that Imogen is dead, and to send Posthumus proof of this. He wants Imogen to return to the court, but she is reluctant because Cloten is there. Pisanio says the alternative is to leave the country. Lucius will arrive in Milford Haven tomorrow. Imogen must disguise herself as a man-he has brought male clothing for her-and live near the house where Posthumus is staying, where she can receive reports on what he is doing. She will then present herself to Lucius and ask for a job as his servant. Pisanio will go back to court in case his absence arouses suspicion that he is involved in Imogen's disappearance.
	Pisanio gives Imogen the box that the Queen gave him, telling her it is medicine that will treat sea-sickness or nausea.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of great pathos in which we sympathize with both Imogen and Pisanio. Pisanio tortures himself with his unwillingness to obey Posthumus and kill Imogen. When he shows her the letter from Posthumus, he says he does not need to draw his sword against her, because the paper ""hath cut her throat already"" (line 33), an image that conveys her vulnerability. Imogen is too innocent even to conceive of being false to her husband, as her bitter speech (lines 40-44) reveals.
	However, Imogen's innocence does not mean she is insipid. She defends herself with great passion and fury against Posthumus's slanders. Her condemnation of Posthumus, that his ""revolt"" against his own apparently virtuous nature would make all good seem as if it were put on for villainous purposes, strikes us as a terrifying curse on mankind. Her rapid-fire command to Pisanio, in reply to his admission that he has not slept since he received Posthumus's order to kill her, to ""Do't, and to bed then,"" is extraordinarily ruthless.
	Imogen uses the imagery of the seasons when questioning Pisanio, asking him whether the contents of the letter he hands her are summer (happy) or winter (sad) news (lines 12-13). Pisanio compares the slander against Imogen with snake venom (lines 35, 39). Reprising the play's bird imagery, Imogen believes that a ""jay of Italy"" (line 49) has seduced Posthumus. A jay has brightly colored plumage, and Imogen imagines this loose woman as being painted with make-up (line 50).
	In another reference to Iachimo's symbolic link with hell, Pisanio rejects Imogen's request that he kill her, protesting that his sword shall not ""damn"" his hand (line 74).
	It is difficult to understand why Pisanio is ready to believe the claim of the Queen, whom he does not trust, that the box she gave him contains healing medicines. But the plot requires that Imogen take these potions, so we are expected to gloss over Pisanio's convenient sudden trust in the Queen.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is bidding farewell to Lucius. Lucius says he is sorry that he has to report to his master that Cymbeline is his enemy. Cymbeline explains that the Britons will not endure Caesar's domination, and for the King to show less desire for independence than his subjects would appear ""unkinglike"" (line 7). Cymbeline gives Lucius safe conduct to Milford Haven.
	Cymbeline says that he must prepare the army to fight the Roman forces, which are in Gallia (France) and ready to invade.
	Cymbeline asks the Queen where Imogen is: she has lately had more of a look of malice than of duty towards him. The Queen urges him to treat her gently, and says time will heal. An attendant reveals that the doors to her rooms are locked and their knocks have gone unanswered. The Queen tries to reassure him by explaining that Imogen has asked her to excuse her staying in; she has not been feeling well. The Queen says she forgot to tell him this.
	The King is alarmed, and leaves. Cloten remarks that he has not seen Pisanio either for two days. He follows the King. The Queen, left alone, prays that Pisanio's absence is explained by the fact that he has swallowed her poison. She wonders if Imogen has either killed herself or run after Posthumus; either outcome would suit the Queen, since then her son Cloten would be heir to the throne.
	Cloten re-enters and confirms that Imogen has fled. The King is in a rage. The Queen is secretly pleased, as she hopes that Cymbeline's wrath will prove fatal to him. She exits. Cloten speaks about his feelings for Imogen, saying he loves her for her unrivalled qualities, but hates her for disdaining him and favoring Posthumus. He wants revenge on her.
	Pisanio enters and Cloten aggressively interrogates him as to Imogen's whereabouts. He asks if she is with Posthumus. Pisanio feigns ignorance, saying Posthumus is in Rome so she cannot be with him. Cloten threatens to kill him unless he tells all. Pisanio presents him with a letter (later revealed to be a forgery, in Act 5, scene 5, line 279), seemingly from Posthumus, saying that this is all he knows of her flight. Pisanio is confident that the letter will not put Imogen in danger as she is far away, and hopes it may disconcert Cloten, as it is an apparently loving letter.
	Aside to the audience, Pisanio says he will write to Posthumus saying that Imogen is dead. He prays for her safe return.
	Having read the letter, Cloten offers Pisanio preferment if he will serve him, and do whatever ""villainy"" Cloten asks of him (line 113). Cloten observes that since Pisanio has loyally served the ""beggar"" Posthumus (line 121), he will surely be loyal to him also. Pisanio agrees.
	Cloten asks Pisanio if he has any of Posthumus's clothes, and Pisanio says he has the suit Posthumus wore when he took leave of Imogen. Cloten asks him to fetch the suit. When Pisanio has left, Cloten reveals that he intends to travel to Milford Haven. Because Imogen once said he revered Posthumus's garment more than Cloten, he will put on the suit and ""ravish her"" (line 142), and kill Posthumus in front of her. That way, Imogen will see his ""valour"" to pay her back for her contempt. He wants both to sate his lust (line 146) and to get revenge on her.
	Pisanio apparently overhears some of Cloten's speech, though we are not yet told this. He returns with Posthumus's clothes. Cloten asks him to take them to his room. He then asks Pisanio to be true to him. Pisanio replies that to be true to him would mean being false to that ""true"" man, Posthumus.
	Analysis
	The imagery of buying and selling continues, with Cloten saying Imogen ""outsells"" all other women (line 75) and that Posthumus's base ""weights"" (line 89)-pieces of cheap metal-are worthless. But Cloten reveals once more his bestial nature, threatening to rip Pisanio's heart out (lines 87-8), a wolf-like and predatory image.
	There is irony in Cloten's ordering Pisanio to perform ""villainy"" in his service, which he says will prove him ""honest"" (lines 113-5). This is indicative of the perverted values of the corrupt court that Belarius warned his adopted sons about: the good man is punished, the bad rewarded. Pisanio expands this theme in lines 162-7, where he says that to be true to Cloten would mean being false to Posthumus, whom Pisanio believes is ""true,"" that is, good. This interpretation has been questioned by critics who view Posthumus, after his fall into jealousy, as being far from true. However, it is clear that Pisanio believes Posthumus to be an essentially true man who was abused by a villain.
	In a chilling twist on the outward appearance versus inward reality theme, Cloten will wear Posthumus's garment in an attempt to wreak revenge on Imogen for saying that she valued it above him. He is also attempting to steal some of Posthumus's perceived worth by adopting his garment-a typically superficial act on his part.
	There is a parallel plot theme in Cloten's plan to clothe himself in Posthumus's suit while in the next scene, Imogen appears dressed as a boy. This throws into relief the difference in their motivations: Cloten wishes revenge on Imogen, who he feels has wronged him, whereas Imogen feels only love for Posthumus, who has certainly wronged her. This leads us into one of the grand themes of the Romance plays, forgiveness and reconciliation. A character's redemption or otherwise largely depends upon their ability to forgive and be forgiven.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 6,"Summary
	In Wales, near Belarius's cave, Imogen enters disguised as a boy. She is lost, has slept rough for two nights, and is on the point of collapse from lack of food. She reflects that to lie when prosperous is a greater crime than to lie out of need, and so falsehood is ""worse in kings than beggars"" (line 14). On this basis, Posthumus is among the false ones.
	She notices Belarius's cave. She fears to make herself known, but starvation gives her courage. She calls out, but receives no answer, so draws her sword and enters the cave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's clear-sightedness is evident in this scene. She does not try to attenuate Posthumus's guilt but recognizes that he is false even as she states her love for him.
	The chance that Imogen should come across the cave where her lost brothers live can strike modern audiences as coincidental to the point of absurdity. But such remarkable happenings, particularly involving lost royal children, are part of the Romance tradition.
	Some modern critics have embraced the magic elements of Romance and placed them within the framework of Jungian psychology, which sees events and characters as different aspects of the Self. In this framework, the aim is to bring to conscious awareness all the 'lost' aspects of the Self, resulting in unity of life and purpose. Thus, the lost royal children can be seen as representing the youthfulness and energy that the court has lost. They can also represent parts of Imogen's scattered self. She has been rejected or abused by the major male figures in her life, and to be embraced by her brothers must come as a healing experience.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 7,"Summary
	Belarius congratulates Guiderius for being most successful in the hunt, and names him as master of the feast. Arviragus and he will play cook and servant. The boys are both weary. Belarius notices Imogen in the cave, and remarks that if she were not eating their food, he would think her a fairy. He next thinks that she is an angel.
	Imogen explains that she has stolen nothing and was going to leave them money for what she has eaten. Guiderius is not impressed, as gold and silver ""turn to dirt"" (line 26), and is only admired by those ""who worship dirty gods"" (line 28). Imogen tells him that had she not helped herself to the food, she would have died of starvation. She tells them she is going to Milford Haven and gives her name as Fidele, which means 'faithful' in French. She says a relative of hers has just embarked at Milford for Italy.
	Belarius bids her welcome, asking her not to measure their minds by the ""rude"" place they live in (line 38). Guiderius seems to feel an attraction towards her, saying her would court her if she were a woman. Arviragus welcomes her as a friend. Aside to the audience, she wishes they had been her brothers, for then she would not have been Cymbeline's sole heir, and Posthumus would have been more her financial equal. The boys notice her distress and sympathize with her.
	Imogen reflects that great men could not surpass the two boys. She would change her sex to be their companion, since Posthumus has proved false.
	Belarius invites her to tell as much of her story as she wishes, after they have eaten.
	Analysis
	'Magic sleep' is one of the themes of the Romance plays. It generally marks some transformative change in the characters' lives. It is significant that both Imogen and the lost royal sons arrive at the cave very tired. The mood is heightened by Belarius's first impression of Imogen, that she is a fairy, and his second, that she is an angel.
	Imogen wishes that she had been poorer and offered ""more equal ballasting"" with Posthumus uses another image of weight and worth, this time to express the balance of power in her relationship (line 50).

	Cloten, dressed in Posthumus's clothes, is in Wales, near the place where Imogen is supposed to meet Posthumus.

He feels that he compares well to Posthumus in youth, looks and strength, and surpasses him in birth and advantages. He predicts that soon he shall have raped Imogen, cut Posthumus's clothes to pieces in front of him, and cut off Posthumus's head. The he plans to send Imogen home to face her father. Cymbeline may be angry with Cloten for treating Imogen roughly, but the Queen will take Cloten's part and make him appear worthy of praise.
	Analysis
	Cloten's superficial awareness is again highlighted in his naeve faith that wearing Posthumus's clothes will play some part in allowing him to steal his wife. Bound up on the level of outward appearance, Cloten has no concept of true worth.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 4 Scene 2,"Summary
	Imogen is still disguised as a boy.
	Belarius notices that Imogen/Fidele is not well and asks her to stay in the cave while he and the boys go hunting. Arviragus addresses her as ""brother"". This has an ironic ring for the audience, which knows that he is Imogen's brother, but not for the characters themselves, who do not know they are related and think it a mere expression of friendship. Guiderius offers to stay with her, but she insists that he go, since she does not want to socialize and he cannot cure her by staying.
	Guiderius tells Imogen/Fidele that he loves her as he does his father, though he does not know why. Arviragus says he also loves Imogen, to the extent that, if one among them had to die, he would choose Belarius rather than her. Belarius is not offended by this, taking it as a sign of the youth's inherent nobility that he has noticed something special about Imogen.
	Aside to the audience, Imogen/Fidele reflects on the kindness of her hosts, and says that she has been lied to at court, where it is said that everyone outside that place is a savage. Her sickness, she says, is a heart-sickness (for love of Posthumus). She takes the drug that Pisanio has given her.
	Guiderius tells his brother that he could not persuade the youth to tell 'his' story. All 'he' would say was that he was well-born, but unfortunate, the victim of dishonesty, but honest. He told Arviragus that he might learn more in future. Imogen retires into the cave.
	Belarius comments that the youth evidently has ""good ancestors"" (line 48). Arviragus is struck by his ""angel-like"" singing voice (line 48), and Guiderius by his exquisite cooking skills.
	Cloten enters. He is upset that he has not found Imogen and Posthumus, and suspects that Pisanio has tricked him by giving him wrong directions. He too feels faint.
	Belarius recognizes Cloten as the son of the Queen. Belarius and the boys are viewed as outlaws, and Belarius thinks they should escape. Guiderius decides to stay with Cloten and suggests that Belarius and Arviragus go to search for any followers. Cloten challenges them as they flee and Guiderius is left to answer Cloten, whom he calls a ""slave""-a term of abuse. Cloten calls Guiderius a law-breaker and demands that he yield. Guiderius asks why he should. Cloten replies, by his clothes-he may mean that they show he is from the court. Cloten tries to provoke Guiderius with insults, but Guiderius does not rise to the bait because he sees that Cloten is a fool. Cloten tells Guiderius his name, thinking that will make him tremble in awe. But Guiderius says he would be more fearful of something with the name of toad, adder or spider, that is, something that can harm him (it was thought toads were venomous). Cloten tries again, saying he is the Queen's son, but Guiderius says he only regrets that he does not seem worthy of this high position.
	Cloten wants Guiderius to fear him, but Guiderius is unmoved, saying that he fears (respects) only those whom he reverences; he laughs at fools. They leave, fighting.
	Belarius and Arviragus return, without having found any followers of Cloten. Guiderius comes in carrying Cloten's head. He says that had he not killed Cloten, Cloten would have killed him. Belarius is horrified, but Guiderius is unrepentant. He says the law does not protect them, so why should they allow ""an arrogant piece of flesh"" (line 127), who usurps the role of judge and executioner, threaten them just because they fear the law?
	Belarius says that though he saw no one else, Cloten must have some attendants, whom Belarius fears. He may have come on a dare, to bring the runaway outlaws back, but it is still unlikely that he would come alone.
	Arviragus is philosophical, saying that they must accept their fate and that his brother has done well. Guiderius says he killed Cloten with his own sword and plans to throw his head into the river, whence it will be carried out to sea. He will tell the fishes that this is the Queen's son: this is the extent of his care for Cloten.
	Belarius fears the deed will be revenged, and wishes Guiderius had not done it. Arviragus wishes that he himself had done it, so that the revenge would pursue him. Belarius warns them not to seek danger where there is no profit.
	Belarius reflects that the boys' behavior shows an inherent royal-ness, which they did not need to be taught. He wonders what Cloten's visit will bring in its wake.
	Guiderius enters to report that he has thrown Cloten's head into the stream. They are interrupted by the sound of solemn music played on Belarius's instrument. Arviragus is the one who generally plays this instrument, but he has not played it since their mother's death. Guiderius wonders what solemn occasion merits its use.
	Arviragus enters with Imogen, seemingly dead, in his arms. He makes an elaborate speech, noting all the different flowers he will plant on her grave. The more practical Guiderius cuts him short, saying that they should bury Imogen near to their mother. Arviragus wants to sing the same dirge that they sang to their mother, but Guiderius says he will not be able to sing for weeping.
	Belarius reminds them that they must also bury Cloten, and with royal honors, since he was the son of a queen. Guiderius asks him to fetch the body, though he comments that when dead, a poor person's body is as good as a powerful person's.
	Guiderius sings the dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (line 258), which deals with the mutability of all things, which must ""come to dust"".
	After Belarius and the boys leave, Imogen awakes from her drugged sleep in a delirious state. She is shocked into clarity by the sight of Cloten's headless body next to her, dressed in Posthumus's clothes. She hopes that she is dreaming. But when it becomes clear that she is not, she is convinced that Pisanio has conspired with Cloten to murder Posthumus. The fact that Pisanio gave her a drug that proved ""murd'rous to the senses"" (line 328) confirms his malice. Imogen falls on the body of Cloten.
	Lucius enters with some of his captains and a Soothsayer. A Captain reports that the troops that were stationed in Gallia are now at Milford Haven and ready to fight. The ""gentlemen"" of Italy, commanded by Iachimo, are also sailing for Britain at the next favorable wind. Lucius gives the order to muster the existing troops, then asks the Soothsayer what he has dreamed regarding the war. He replies that he saw Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards and disappearing into the beams of the sun, which means Rome will be victorious.
	Lucius finds the bodies of Imogen and Cloten. The Captain says Imogen is alive. Lucius asks Imogen to explain what has happened, the identity of the headless man, and her interest in him. Imogen, still adopting the persona of Fidele, describes the body as her master, killed by brigands. She laments that she will never find another to equal him. She says his name is Richard du Champ and that her name is Fidele. Lucius says her name fits her faith, and invites her to enter his service. Imogen agrees, and Lucius bids her be cheerful, as ""Some falls are means the happier to arise"" (line 403). Lucius and his men go to dig Cloten a grave.
	Analysis
	Imogen's taking of the drug is another hint, along with the previous references to sleepiness, that a transformation in awareness is about to happen. The regenerative theme is invoked in Arviragus' description of patience and grief as two plants which have taken root in Imogen, and his prayer that the first thrives while the second withers.
	Cloten's insistence that Guiderius should know who he is by his clothes shows the excessive importance Cloten gives to appearance over inner identity. Guiderius recognizes Cloten's foolishness for thinking that the borrowed clothes ""make"" him (line 83). It should be the other way around: men make clothes.
	The contrast between the true world of the Welsh countryside and the false world of the court is clear in the fact that in the country, Cloten's and the Queen's names and high rank fail to strike awe into anyone's heart; venomous beasts, on the other hand, can do harm and are feared. The appearance versus reality theme is picked up again in Guiderius' comment that Cloten does not seem worthy of such high birth. Note the deliberate contrast between Cloten, who constantly expected respect on the basis of his superficial rank, but inwardly did not deserve it, and Guiderius, who is outwardly a poor outlaw but who exemplifies princely and noble behavior.
	This appearance versus reality theme plays into that of worth. Guiderius, after killing Cloten, calls him a worthless ""empty purse"" with no money in it (lines 113-4). After Guiderius has cut off Cloten's head, Belarius fears that ""the body hath a tail / More perilous than the head."" This grotesque image brings home Cloten's bestial nature and is an outward expression of his inward state-all animal appetite with little of the higher reason that in Renaissance thought separated men from beasts.
	Guiderius' quip that he will tell the fishes that the head he has thrown into the sea is that of the Queen's son represents Cloten stripped of his much-vaunted nobility and reduced to the base level of food for beasts. This image strips away the sophisticated but false veneer behind which the court has hidden its moral decay. The headless corpse is symbolic too of the kingdom under Cymbeline: he is a weak king ruled by his wife. The entire episode of Guiderius's killing of Cloten has an oddly fable-like quality. It is presented more as a story of a noble knight killing a monster than how it would be seen in a more realistic play-the murder of the heir to the throne on what appears to be trivial provocation.
	Belarius likens the two boys to nature herself. He compares their gentleness to a breeze that leaves the violet unmoved, and their roughness to the strongest wind that can bend a tree. He says that though they have never been taught royal behavior and valor, it grows in them as a wild (i.e. not deliberately cultivated) crop. This is another example of the theme of inherent royalty or nobility.
	The dirge, ""Fear no more the heat o' th' sun"" (lines 258-81), is perhaps the best known part of the play. It draws upon the theme of gold and worth, and sets them in the context of the mutability of all things: even ""golden lads and girls,"" those most valued in life, must eventually come to dust, as surely as do chimney sweeps. Death is the great leveler, and makes the ""frown o' th' great,"" ""slander"" and the ""tyrant's stoke,"" as well as mankind's great achievements in the field of learning and lovers' passion, irrelevant.
	Coming so soon after Arviragus' lyrical speech about the flowers he will plant on Imogen's grave, this song has the effect of measuring the world that man constructs for himself and identifies so strongly with, but which all ends in dust, against the great creative force of nature, which endlessly generates new life.
	Belarius's comment about dewy herbs being fittest for graves recalls the Queen's sinister words in Act 1, scene 6.
	Imogen's invocation of a drop of pity as small as ""a wren's eye"" (line 305) represents another bird image, part of the theme of regenerative nature. Another example of the bird theme is the soothsayer's dream of Rome's victory in battle as Jove's sacred bird, the eagle, winging its way westwards (line 348).

	Cymbeline asks how his wife is. She has run mad with a fever at Cloten's absence, and her life is in danger. The King is forlorn at the loss of Imogen and the possible loss of the Queen, as well as the absence of Cloten at a time when a frightening war looms. He believes Pisanio knows something about Imogen's departure, and threatens to torture him until he reveals it. Pisanio counters that he knows nothing, but asserts his loyalty to the King.
	The First Lord backs up Pisanio, saying that the day she went missing, he was at court. There is a search party looking for Cloten. The King lets Pisanio off the hook for now. The First Lord tells the King that the Roman forces have landed, together with the Roman gentlemen sent by the Senate. He reassures the King that the British forces are ready. Cymbeline longs for the advice of Cloten and the Queen. The King and courtiers leave Pisanio alone.
	Pisanio worries that he has not heard from Posthumus since he wrote telling him that Imogen had been killed. Nor has he heard from Imogen or anything of Cloten. Pisanio repeats that he is only false in order to be honest; and the wars shall prove he loves his country.
	Analysis
	This scene is unique in that it pushes Cymbeline into the foreground. But he only emphasizes his unkingly nature by lamenting his comfortless state, with his daughter, wife and Cloten all unavailable to him at a time when he is nervous about the war. Cymbeline's uncertain nature compares unfavorably with the youthful bravery of his lost sons, which features prominently in the next scene.

Arviragus thinks that the King will be too busy with the war to look into their origins, but Belarius points out that he is well known in the army, and besides, the King has not deserved their service or love.
	But Guiderius and Arviragus believe that they should all go to fight in the wars. Guiderius says he and his brother are not known by anyone at court, and Belarius is forgotten and ""o'ergrown"" (line 33), possibly meaning bearded and unrecognizable, or simply grown out of their thoughts. Guiderius and Arviragus ask for Belarius's blessing to go to war. Belarius replies that since they value their young lives so slightly, there is no reason why he should set more value on his old one. He joins them as they go off to fight.
	Analysis
	The courage of Guiderius and Arviragus, contrasted with Cymbeline's lack of kingly valor in the previous scene, leaves no doubt that it is time for a regime change. Shakespeare's plays uphold the divinely ordained nature of kingship; thus, those who kill, depose or usurp a rightful king must always pay a price. But running alongside this is the idea that kingship is part of the great cycle of nature, in which old, sick and decaying branches wither and die, to be replaced by young, vigorous growth. Cymbeline is the decayed king, while his lost sons, nurtured in the womb of the wild Welsh countryside, are now ripe to assume royal roles.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 1,"Summary
	Posthumus is now at the Roman camp in Britain, having joined the Roman forces. He carries with him a bloodstained cloth, sent to him by Pisanio (Act 3, scene 4, line 126) as proof of Imogen's murder. He repents that he had Imogen killed (as he believes), a wife better than himself, for straying just a little. In an example of dramatic irony (where the audience knows what the characters on stage do not), he wishes that Pisanio had obeyed only his just commands, and that the gods had saved Imogen and struck him with more vengeance. Though he has come to Britain to fight against his wife's kingdom, he feels this to be wrong-he has done enough by killing Imogen and will give no wound to her country. He plans to replace his Roman clothes with those of a British peasant, and fight with the Britons against the Romans.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's penitence is somewhat unsatisfying and fails to command much sympathy. He regrets ordering Imogen's killing, but still believes she is guilty. Thus, though he has recovered some sense of perspective regarding her alleged sin, he fails to give her the trust she deserves.
	As we have seen with Imogen, the shedding and adoption of clothing can carry symbolic weight. Posthumus's decision to shed his Roman soldier's clothes and adopt a British peasant's clothing carries many meanings: his attempt to make amends to Imogen and Britain; his abandonment of attempts to control and punish others and willingness to surrender to his fate; and his penitent attempt to replace impressive clothing with inward worth. He will show more valor than his garments suggest, fight as an unknown soldier without the benefit of his martial reputation, and ""begin / To fashion less without, and more within"" (lines 32-3).
	Note the confusion of roles adopted by Posthumus and Imogen. Imogen, a Briton, has disguised herself as a boy and is serving the commander of the Roman army. Posthumus, another Briton, has been exiled to Rome, is supposed to be serving in the Roman army, and arrived in Britain dressed as a Roman, but has secretly defected to the British cause and is now dressed as a poor Briton. Both characters will, in their disguised roles, find a deeper inner truth than they previously knew.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 2,"Summary
	Lucius, Iachimo and the Roman army enter at one side of the stage, and the British army at another, with Posthumus following, dressed as a poor soldier. There is a skirmish between Iachimo and Posthumus, who disarms Iachimo and leaves. Iachimo, left alone, is penitent that he slandered Imogen, the princess of Britain, and says that his guilt is robbing him of his courage. Otherwise, how could this poor soldier have subdued him, a professional soldier?
	The battle continues. The Britons retreat in disarray and panic, and Cymbeline is taken prisoner. Belarius, Guiderius and Arviragus enter and, helped by Posthumus, rescue Cymbeline. Then Lucius, Iachimo and Imogen enter. Lucius sends Imogen away from the fighting, for her safety. Iachimo warns Lucius that the British are bringing in reinforcements. Lucius says they too must bring in more troops, or retreat.
	Analysis
	Coming fast on the heels of Posthumus' penitence is Iachimo's. Both are perhaps less rewarding and dramatic than they should be, since we do not see the journey that led them to this point.
	The decay into which Cymbeline's kingdom has fallen is clear from the shameful disorder into which his army descends. The fact that his lost sons become his rescuer emphasizes the regenerative theme of the new world redeeming the old. The cure for the court's and the nation's sickness lies in the sons' hands. Belarius's involvement is satisfying, since it expiates his sin of stealing the royal children: he heals where once he wounded.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 3,"Summary
	Posthumus is talking to a British Lord, who fled the battle. Posthumus says there is no shame in this, since all seemed lost for the Britons, until the gods intervened. He tells the Lord how an old man and two boys-obviously Belarius, Arviragus and Guiderius-turned the battle around by stopping the Britons from fleeing and making them fight the Romans. The Romans are defeated, and Lucius has been taken prisoner.
	Posthumus, disappointed that he did not die in battle, has dressed again in Roman clothing. He comes forward and gives himself up to the Britons, wishing to be taken prisoner and put to death. They capture him and plan to take him to the King.
	Analysis
	Posthumus commands more sympathy in this scene than previously. Giving himself up to the Britons to be put to death is arguably a just punishment for his actions.
	Cymbeline, in another bird image, is compared to a bird without wings (line 5); the Romans are like a predatory animal, ""Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring"" (line 8). However, the Britons win because the gods help them (""the heavens fought"" (line 4). This is one of the play's most notable instances of supernatural intervention-though it is dramatically unconvincing, as is confirmed by the Lord's reaction to Posthumus's account of it-and gives a foretaste of the elements that will follow in the next scene.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 4,"Summary
	Posthumus enters in chains, with his jailers. They leave him alone, whereupon he explains that he welcomes his bondage, as it is for him the way to freedom (death). He says his conscience is more of a prisoner than his body, and asks the gods to give him the ""penitent instrument"" (line 10) to pick this lock, setting him free forever. He feels that volunteering to be put into chains is the best way. He asks the gods to take his life for Imogen's, though ""'Tis not so dear"" (line 23).
	He falls asleep. Solemn music sounds to signal the scene of Posthumus's dream. A group of spirits, Posthumus's ancestors and dead brothers, gather round him. They beg Jupiter, king of the gods, to intervene and help Posthumus. Jupiter descends on an eagle, and throws a thunderbolt. The spirits fall upon their knees. Jupiter is annoyed with them, but promises that he will uplift Posthumus's fortunes and that Posthumus will be reunited with Imogen.
	Posthumus awakens, bitterly disappointed that his relatives have vanished. He finds a book on the ground, and hopes that the contents are worthy of the cover. He opens the book and reads a cryptic prophecy. It predicts that when a lion's whelp (Posthumus Leonatus) shall be embraced by ""a piece of tender air"" (Imogen), and when branches shall be lopped from a dead cedar (Cymbeline having lost his sons), but which shall later revive (restoration of the lost sons), then Posthumus shall be happy and Britain shall flourish.
	Posthumus does not fully understand the prophecy, but feels it bears some likeness to his life, and so keeps it.
	The jailers return and tell Posthumus that he shall be hanged. He says he is more than ready. The First Gaoler, with mordant humor, comforts him with the news that he needs fear no more tavern bills: he who dies pays all debts. The Gaoler reflects that he has never seen a person who is so eager to be hanged as Posthumus. He wishes that everyone were good, so that there would be no more gaolers or gallows. Though this would deprive him of his present job, he would hope for a better one.
	Analysis
	Posthumus's opening lines carry an emotional power that is lacking in his earlier speeches. His request to the gods that they take him in payment for Imogen's death, coupled with his certainty that he is worth less than she, is full of pathos.
	The dream scene has perhaps attracted more criticism than anything else by Shakespeare. It is written in poor quality doggerel verse, serves no dramatic purpose, and its style and language bear little relation to Shakespeare's other work, leading to doubts that it is his. The character Jupiter has been called ""preposterous"" and indeed, it is difficult to play this scene without arousing laughter of the wrong sort. It is possible that it was later interpolated-by Shakespeare or another writer - for a performance at the court of King James I, where elaborate masques involving gods, painted scenery and 'flying' persons supported by wires were popular. But equally, it may be that it was written by Shakespeare in one of his less inspired moments.
	The scene is an example of a type of stage device which leant a new phrase to the English language: deus ex machina, Latin for, literally, the god from the machine. It originated with Greek and Roman theater, when a machine would lower a god or gods onto the stage to resolve a hopeless situation. The phrase deus ex machina has been extended to refer to any resolution to a story which does not pay regard to the story's internal logic and is so unlikely that it challenges the audience's suspension of disbelief. Its advantage is that it allows authors to end the story in the way they want.
	Posthumus's hope that the book that the spirits leave behind is not merely ""a garment / Nobler than that it covers"" (line 134-5) recalls the theme of appearance versus reality. Symbolically, the book is important, as it marks the crossing-over of the supernatural world into the natural world. It is inevitable that Posthumus's life will be transformed as a result.

Cymbeline: Novel Summary: Act 5 Scene 5,"Summary
	Cymbeline is in his tent, surrounded by Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus and Pisanio. He calls Belarius and the two sons the ""preservers of my throne"" (line 2) and regrets that the ""poor soldier"" who fought so well (Posthumus) cannot be found. Pisanio says that a thorough search has been done but in vain.
	In response to Cymbeline's question, Belarius says that they were born in Cambria (Wales), that they are gentlemen, and that they are honest. Cymbeline creates them knights and promises other rewards.
	Cornelius enters and announces that the Queen has died in madness. Before she died, she confessed that she never loved Cymbeline, but married him for his royal position; that she killed Imogen with poison; and that she had intended to poison Cymbeline slowly with a mineral, winning him over to the idea of naming Cloten as his heir. But when Cloten vanished, she grew desperate and died. Cymbeline says that his senses were not at fault, since she was beautiful and flattered him well, and neither was his heart, which ""thought her like her seeming"" (line 65), but he repents his folly in choosing her.
	Lucius, Iachimo, the Soothsayer, and other Roman prisoners are brought in. Posthumus and the still-disguised Imogen/Fidele follow. Cymbeline tells Lucius that the relatives of the British soldiers who died in battle have asked him to kill the Roman prisoners. Lucius says that the Britons only won the battle by accident, and that if the Romans had won, they would not have threatened British prisoners with the sword. But if they are to die, they will bear it ""with a Roman's heart"" (line 81). He asks only that his page (Imogen) be ransomed, as he is a Briton who has done no Briton harm. Cymbeline says the boy's face looks familiar, and grants his life and any favor he might ask - even the life of the noblest prisoner. Lucius tells Imogen/Fidele that he need not beg for his (Lucius's) life. Imogen tells him that she did not intend to: Lucius's life ""must shuffle for itself"" as she has seen something ""Bitter to me as death"" (lines 103-4). She is, of course, looking at Posthumus. Lucius is hurt.
	Cymbeline asks Imogen/Fidele again what he would like, as he loves him more and more. Imogen offers to tell him in private. While they talk aside, Belarius and the sons remark on the resemblance between this lad and Fidele. Pisanio, in an aside, is certain that he is Imogen.
	Cymbeline calls Iachimo forward and asks Imogen/Fidele to speak his demand to him; he also orders Iachimo to answer honestly, on pain of torture. Imogen asks as her promised favor that Iachimo tell from whom he got the ring. Iachimo admits that he got it ""by villainy"" (line 142); it had belonged to the noble Posthumus, whom Cymbeline banished. As Iachimo begins to tell that part of his story involving Imogen, he almost faints, saying his heart ""drops blood."" Iachimo describes how Posthumus praised Cymbeline's daughter above all other women for her chastity, how Posthumus agreed on the wager, and how by trickery he gathered his 'evidence' of Imogen's adultery.
	Posthumus is anguished that he fell for Iachimo's lies. He comes forward, identifying himself to Cymbeline as the one who had Imogen killed and ranting about his guilt. Imogen interrupts him, and he, thinking that she scorns his feelings, hits her. She falls to the ground.
	Pisanio is shocked, telling Posthumus that he never killed Imogen until now. As Pisanio tends to Imogen, Imogen casts him off, saying that he gave her poison. Pisanio protests that he believed the potion to be a precious medicine. Cornelius points out that the Queen confessed to him that she gave the potion to Pisanio for Imogen believing it to be poison, whereas it was only a medicine to temporarily shut down the signs of life. Imogen reveals that she took it, and Belarius realizes that Imogen was never really dead. Imogen asks Posthumus why he threw her from him, and embraces him.
	Cymbeline now recognizes his daughter, and she kneels for his blessing. Belarius tells his sons that he does not blame them for loving Imogen, since they are her brothers. Cymbeline tells Imogen that the Queen is dead and Cloten gone. Pisanio explains that he gave Cloten a forged letter, seemingly from Posthumus, which guided him to the mountains near Milford to seek Imogen. He planned to violate Imogen's honor, though Pisanio knows nothing more.
	Guiderius explains that he killed Cloten. Cymbeline is stunned. He hopes Guiderius can tell him this is not so, since is reluctant to punish Guiderius, in view of his good deeds in the battle. Guiderius refuses to deny it, and justifies his action on the grounds of Cloten's unprincely behavior. Cymbeline regretfully says that Guiderius must die, by law.
	Belarius intervenes, saying that the boys have merited more from Cymbeline than ever Cloten did. He warns the boys that he must tell a story that will be dangerous to him, though helpful to them. Belarius reveals that he is the man who was banished as a traitor by Cymbeline. Cymbeline orders Belarius to be taken away, but Belarius regains control of the situation with a cheeky joke, asking the King first to pay him for bringing up his sons. Belarius explains that he is not the boys' father, as they believe; they are Cymbeline's sons. He was wrongfully banished; he had the boys' nurse, Euriphile, steal them for him, and married her in payment. Now, he gives them back to Cymbeline, saying that he received his punishment before he stole them, in the form of his banishment. He offers as proof a mantle in which Arviragus was wrapped, and which was made by their mother. Cymbeline recalls that Guiderius had a mole on his neck, and Belarius shows that the older boy still has it.
	Cymbeline rejoices that he has as if given birth to three (the sons and the returned Belarius). He tells Imogen that she has unluckily lost a kingdom, as she is no longer the heir. But Imogen protests that she has gained two worlds, meaning her brothers. Imogen and her brothers reveal to Cymbeline that they have met before (in Wales) and loved each other at first sight.
	Cymbeline, in wonder, wants to hear the rest of the story, but first intends that they will go to the temple to give thanks. He greets Belarius as his brother and gives the order for the prisoners to be allowed to share the celebrations. Imogen promises Lucius that she will yet do him service.
	Cymbeline's thoughts turn to the poor soldier who fought so well alongside Belarius and the boys, at which Posthumus identifies himself as this soldier. He asks Iachimo to confirm that it was he who, dressed as the poor soldier, disarmed Iachimo. Iachimo kneels before Posthumus and begs him to take his life. He gives Posthumus the ring and bracelet of ""the truest princess"" (line 417). Posthumus spares Iachimo's life, saying that he does not do him a favor in so doing (because Iachimo will have to live with his guilt), and tells him to ""deal with others better"" (line 421).
	Inspired by Posthumus, Cymbeline gives a blanket pardon to all.
	Grateful to Posthumus's help in the battle, the sons welcome him as their brother. Posthumus calls for the Soothsayer to explain the cryptic prophecy he found after his sleep. The prophecy ends with a prediction of peace and prosperity for Britain through the descendants of the royal sons.
	In an afterthought, Cymbeline tells Lucius that though the Britons won the battle, he will resume the tribute to Rome, from which he was dissuaded by the wicked Queen. The Soothsayer claims his prophecy (told to Lucius) about the eagle soaring from south to west, vanishing in the beams of the sun, was accurate, since it meant that Caesar (the eagle) would unite with Cymbeline (the sun).
	Cymbeline declares peace and orders the Roman and British flags to be carried through London together. They all go to the temple of Jupiter to celebrate.
	Analysis
	This is a scene of revelations, each of which resolves one of the plotlines of the play. As such, it is a scene in which truth triumphs over falsehood and appearance is stripped away, leaving reality visible.
	Iachimo chooses to reveal his story, which resolves the main plotline of Posthumus's false accusation of Imogen, very slowly, heightening the tension and confirming his ascendancy as the most dramatically painted character of the play.
	After Iachimo's confession, the revelations come hot on each others' heels, creating an atmosphere of wonder and magic.
	Though the resolutions of the intellect happen through these revelations, the resolutions of the heart come with forgiveness. Everyone who has been wronged forgives his or her wronger. The most touching example is Imogen's unquestioning forgiveness of her husband Posthumus. The fact that Posthumus strikes her even as they are reunited makes him seem unworthy of her forgiveness, but this has the effect of exalting her love to the status of divine grace (the sense that God loves even the unworthy sinner). The least convincing act of forgiveness is, ironically, Posthumus's to Iachimo. Posthumus says that he is only leaving Iachimo alive because that way he will suffer more. Once again, Posthumus compares poorly to his wife.
	Posthumus' words as Imogen embraces him, ""Hang there like fruit, my soul, / Till the tree die,"" are moving, though whether they are moving enough to regain the audience's sympathy after all he has done, is a question worthy of debate. Especially difficult to stomach is his striking Imogen when she tries to declare her true identity. Granted, he does not know it is her at the time, but given that he is supposedly penitent about his past treatment of her, it seems an ill omen that leads us to wonder how deep his reformation runs.
	Cymbeline's comment that he thought the Queen to be ""like her seeming"" reveals his characteristic lack of emotional instinct and inability to distinguish outer appearance from reality-the same quality that led him to banish honest men and put his trust in wicked and stupid people.
	Cymbeline's promise to resume the tribute to Rome after the Britons won a bloody victory fighting for this very cause is an anti-climax which has caused some critics to wonder if Shakespeare was laughing at his characters or at his audience. However, it may be a patriotic attempt to save face for the British in spite of the chronicler Holinshed's citation of Latin sources claiming that Rome was ultimately victorious, and the fact that the Roman occupation of Britain persisted for many decades after Cymbeline's reign. Shakespeare shows a battle in which the Britons prevailed, rather than the entire war, which the Romans won; then he shows Cymbeline choosing to resume the tribute to Rome out of generosity rather than through subjugation. It's one way of making out that the Britons won, when they actually lost.

 The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary ,"Chapter 1

Summary
	The story begins in the fall of 1897, at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush. Buck is a large, one-hundred and forty pound dog who lives on a ranch owned by Judge Miller in Santa Clara, California, some forty miles south of San Francisco.
	Buck is four years old and has an enjoyable life. Unlike the other, smaller dogs on the ranch, he is allowed to roam over the entire property. He goes into the swimming tank, hunts with the judge's sons, and escorts the judge's daughters on their morning walks. In the winter he lies at the feet of the judge in front of the fire in the library. He is like a king who lords it over all the other creatures, and is treated with respect by everyone.
	Buck's comfortable life is ended when Manuel, one of the gardener's helpers, take him for a walk and sells him to a man who treats him roughly and throws him into the baggage car of a train. Halfway through the night Buck is transferred to a cage-like crate. In the morning, four men come to pick up the crate. They amuse themselves by poking sticks at him. Buck is conveyed to a railway depot, where he is placed in an express car. He stays there for two days and nights, during which he neither eats nor drinks. He is bundled off the train at Seattle, where a man in a red sweater takes charge of him. The man lets Buck out of the cage, and Buck attacks him in fury, but the man brutally beats him into submission with a club. Buck is beaten but his spirit is not broken. In the days that follow, more dogs arrive, and Buck watches as they are beaten in the same fashion. Adapting to his new situation, Buck realizes that the man is the master and must be obeyed.
	Buck is then sold to a man named Perrault, a Canadian government mail-driver, who realizes from Buck's impressive appearance that he is a dog in a thousand. Along with a dog named Curly, they travel north on the deck of the ship, Narwhal. The dogs are turned over to Francois, a swarthy French-Canadian. Buck learns to respect both men, since they are calm and fair. There are two other dogs on the ship, a big dog from Spitzbergen, and a gloomy one named Dave, who just likes to be left alone. The weather gets colder as they head north, and Buck encounters snow for the first time.
	Analysis
	The Call of the Wild can be read simply as an adventure story about a dog, but most commentators see in it something deeper than that. There are many parallels between the world of dogs and the world of humans, so the novel can be read as a kind of human allegory. Buck himself is given emotions such as pride and shame, and an awareness of abstract ideas such as justice.
	In the first chapter Buck takes the first steps to discovering a different kind of law of life than he has known at Judge Miller's ranch. His life there is very orderly and civilized. He is like a ""sated aristocrat""; he is compared to a country gentleman and a lord (since he is lord over all the other animals on the ranch). In this civilized life, wild impulses are tamed. Buck enjoys comfort and privilege. He does not have to fight for anything; all his needs are provided for. He has not had to earn his position; like an aristocrat, he was born to it. But his deeper nature is unknown to him, and this is what he will discover during the course of the novel. It is a painful journey. In chapter 1, for example, he learns for the first time that there can be other relationships between man and dog than the one he has known. The man in the red sweater who clubs him into submission is his introduction to a ruthless world in which the strong rule, and Buck makes his first adaptation to it.

The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 2,"Summary
	Buck's first day on the beach at the port city of Dyea (just across from Skagway, Alaska), is a nightmare. The other dogs are savage and fight. Curly is killed by a pack of dogs after she goes down in a fight. Buck starts to hate Spitz because Spitz laughs at the scene.
	Buck is again shocked when Franeois puts him in harness with the other dogs and puts him to work, pulling a sled. Franeois maintains firm discipline, and Buck learns easily to recognize and obey the commands. Spitz is the team leader.
	Two more dogs arrive, Billie and Joe. Billie is good-natured, but Joe is sour, with a perpetual snarl. Then another dog, Sol-leks, arrives. His name means the Angry One. Spitz, who had bullied the other newcomers, leaves him alone.
	At night, Buck is surprised to find that he is excluded from the warm tent. Outside, it is far too cold to sleep. But he soon learns to dig himself a hole in the snow, and sleeps warm.
	In the morning, three more huskies are added, making nine in all. They take a trail toward the Dyea Canon. The work is hard but Buck does not despise it, and Dave and Sol-leks, who are placed either side of him, are good instructors.
	They travel north across glaciers and snowdrifts and lakes, and late at night pull into camp at the head of Lake Bennett, where there are thousands of men who have come seeking gold.
	The next day they travel forty miles, but in subsequent days, as they break their own trail, they cannot travel as fast. Buck toils in the traces for many long days. He is given a pound and a half of sun-dried salmon every day, but he finds it is not enough, although the other dogs, who weigh less, find it adequate. He learns how to steal bacon from Perrault, because this is necessary in order to survive. In other ways, too, he adapts to his new, ruthless environment. His muscles become hard, and he is impervious to pain. His senses become extremely acute.
	Analysis
	The law of club and fang is Buck's interpretation of the laws that govern the new life he is leading. It is a ruthless, Darwinian world of the survival of the fittest, a total contrast to what he has known in his first four years of his life. There is no room here for kindness and love, or morality. The death of Curly shows him that just as he has learned a new relationship between man and dog, here in the north there is a new relationship between dog and dog. A dog must prevail through ferocity, strength and courage; to show weakness is to be killed. It is notable how quickly he adapts to all the challenges that face him. He has left the civilized world far behind. He is now prepared to steal food for his master, something that would not have occurred to him in his life with Judge Miller.
	A key passage occurs near the end of the chapter. Buck may have had many generations before him of domesticated dogs, but he retains an instinctual memory of the behavior of his ancestors, before they were tamed by man. He learns so quickly because he is able to tap into these primitive instincts. They were always there within him, but the cosseted, lazy life he led on Judge Miller's ranch did not bring them out. Now he is bringing forth the forgotten side of his nature: ""It was no task for him to learn to fight with cut and slash and the quick wolf snap. In this manner had fought forgotten ancestors. They quickened the old life within him, and the old tricks which they had stamped into the heredity of the breed were his tricks.""
	At the level of the human allegory, this suggests that there is a lot more to human life and behavior than what is revealed in civilized society. Men too, in certain conditions, will revert to a more instinctual, primitive level of life, in which the law of the jungle usurps civilized morality.

Summary
	The deadly rivalry between Spitz and Buck grows. One night Buck makes his nest under a sheltering rock, but when Buck returns after eating his food, he finds that Spitz has taken it over. He attacks Spitz, but their fight is interrupted when the camp is invaded by about fifty starving huskies who have scented the camp from an Indian village. They try to steal all the food. Three of them attack Buck, and the other sled dogs are attacked, too. Francois and Perrault drive them off. All the nine team-dogs are injured. They regroup in the forest and return to camp at daybreak.
	They set off again, down the partially frozen Thirty Mile River, covering only thirty miles in six days. The temperature is fifty below zero. Once, the sled falls through the ice on the river, and Buck and Dave are nearly drowned. Another time, Spitz goes through the ice, and only the strength of Buck and the others saves them all. Then the ice breaks and they have to escape by climbing a cliff. That day they cover only a quarter of a mile.
	Weathering all the difficulties, they persevere. Buck's feet are not as tough as those of the other dogs, and get very sore. Francois makes moccasins for him out of the tops of his own moccasins. Later, Buck's feet get harder, and the moccasins are thrown away.
	One morning, Dolly suddenly goes mad, and Francois kills him with an axe. Spitz attacks Buck but is driven off by Francois's whip. From that point on it is a war between Spitz, the lead dog, and Buck, since Spitz feels threatened by Buck. On another occasion, when Spitz is punishing the malingerer Pike, Buck attacks him, but this time it is Buck who is driven off by the whip wielded by Francois.
	They arrive in Dawson, in the Yukon territory. They spend a week there, before making the return trip, with Perrault carrying important dispatches. They cover fifty miles in the first day. But the dog-team is not harmonious, since Buck's rebellion against Spitz has destroyed the solidarity of the team. In a breakdown of discipline, the other dogs also challenge Spitz.
	As the dog-pack chases down a rabbit, with Buck in the lead, Spitz cuts him off and gets to the rabbit first. This initiates a fight between the two dogs. Buck is triumphant, and Spitz is killed.
	Analysis
	This chapter vividly shows the difficulties and the dangers that the travelers encounter, both external and internal. (Madness afflicts one of the dogs.) As the strongest, Buck inevitably triumphs over Spitz. It is his destiny to become the ""dominant primordial beast."" He uses cunning as well as strength, and he is infinitely patient. He knows how to use his wiles to undermine Spitz's authority with the other dogs, and as a result there is general insubordination amongst the dog-team. Buck has left a human community, with tame animals, but has found himself in another, more ruthless kind of animal community in which the pack dominates, and every pack needs a leader.
	In regressing to a more primitive state, and becoming leader of the pack, Buck discovers for the first time a kind of superior joy, greater than anything he could have known on Judge Miller's ranch. He is getting in touch with the energy of life itself as it surges up within him, not tempered by any civilized or moral values, which, from this point of view, dilute rather than enhance life. London makes this clear in eloquent words: ""There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive."" In the harsh conditions that prevail in Alaska, in which Buck must be constantly alert, and is constantly put to the test, he discovers his true nature.

The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 4,"Summary
	The next morning, as Franeois harnesses the dogs, he tries to install Sol-leks in the lead position. But Buck refuses to accept this. He wants to be the lead dog, and will not settle for anything less. Franeois and Perrault at first try to beat him into obedience, but Buck keeps out of reach. Eventually Buck wins the battle of wills and is installed as the lead dog. He excels in the position, and quickly restores discipline in the team. Two more dogs, Teek and Koona, are acquired, and Buck breaks them in. The weather is comparatively benign and they make good progress, averaging forty miles a day for fourteen days until they reach Skagway.
	Franeois and Perrault are ordered elsewhere by the government, and leave Buck behind. He makes the trip back to Dawson with his team under a new master. They are extremely tired but get only a two-day break before setting off once more. At nights, Buck has visions of life from long ago; he sees a caveman and large beasts of prey. He is fascinated by these visions, which take him further back into primitive times.
	The dogs get more and more weary, and Dave in particular weakens. He is taken out of the traces, but he resents this. He wants to continue to do his job despite the fact that he is too weak to do to. So his driver puts him back in harness, and Dave continues to pull, falling down several times. They reach camp at night, but in the morning Dave is too weak to travel. The dog-sled moves out without him, and the Scotch half-breed who is in charge goes back and shoots Dave in an act of mercy.
	Analysis
	Buck quickly shows that he is a worthy pack leader, since the dog-team makes the run to Skagway in record time. This makes Franeois and Perrault local celebrities, but it is to Buck that they owe their success.
	Franeois and Perrault then depart from Buck's life for good. They were hard men, but they treated Buck fairly, and he respected them. They are both examples of men who adapted well to their harsh, uncivilized environment. Perrault in particular is described in terms that could also be applied to Buck (""Nothing daunted him""). They show that when men, like the dogs, also revert to a more primitive way of life and behavior, it is possible to do so with honor. Buck's next experience with humans, in chapter 5, will show the other side of the coin.
	The significance of the vision of the cave-man is that Buck is tapping into the collective memory of the species, not his own personal memories. It is this that makes him so quick to adapt to primitive ways of life. Something in him remembers the lives of his ancestors, even though at a personal level all he can remember is his luxurious, easy life at Judge Miller's ranch.

The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 5,"Chapter 5
Summary
	After reaching Dawson, the team returns to Skagway. The journey takes one month. The dogs are worn out; Buck has lost twenty-five pounds in weight. Within four days, Buck and his mates are sold to Charles, a middle-aged man, and Hal, a man of about nineteen. Traveling with the men is Mercedes, who is Charles's wife and Hal's sister. Buck's new owners are incompetent, and overload the sled. The dogs are unable to move it. Hal calls them lazy and whips them, although Mercedes tries to persuade him not to. An onlooker suggests that Hal help the dogs by freeing the runners of the sled that are frozen to the snow. When this is done, the dogs are able to pull the sled, but it is so badly loaded it overturns. The owners reluctantly cut the load in half, and acquire six more dogs, making a total of fourteen. The newcomers are not much use, however, and nor does Buck have his heart in the work. He knows he cannot depend on his new masters, because they do not know how to do anything. Progress is very slow, and dog food runs short. Half the food goes when only a quarter of the distance has been covered. One of the dogs, Dub, is injured, and Hal shoots him. Six dogs die of starvation. As the going gets tougher, the three travelers fall to quarreling. Mercedes insists on riding on the sled, which adds intolerably to the load pulled by the weak and starving dogs. Hal, Charles and Mercedes are insensitive to the suffering of the animals. But the seven remaining dogs continue to pull the sled, despite their ill-treatment. One day Billie collapses and cannot continue. Hal kills him with an axe. The next day Koona dies, and only five remain.
	It is spring time, but the travelers are in such a desperate situation they do not notice it. The ice on the river is beginning to break up, but they manage to reach the camp of John Thornton at the mouth of White River. Thornton tells them to take no more chances on the melting ice. Hal refuses to take his advice and wants to continue. But he cannot persuade his exhausted dogs to get up, so he whips them until they begin to move. But Buck refuses. Hal beats him with a club, but Buck has made a decision not to get up. Thornton intervenes, striking Hal, and telling Hal he will kill him if he hits the dog again. Hal draws a knife, but Thornton knocks it out of his hand.
	Hal decides to make off without Buck. They pull out from the bank and start off down the river. After a quarter of a mile, the ice breaks up and the men and dogs are all drowned.
	Analysis
	Charles, Hal and Mercedes are the opposite of the grizzled but efficient Fran�ois and Perrault. They cannot adapt to their new, harsh Arctic environment, as is shown when they overload the sled because they want to take all the trappings of their former, more civilized life-canned goods, blankets, dishes-with them. They consistently exercise bad judgment, so it is natural, according to the law of the survival of the fittest, that they should perish.
	In this episode, London contrasts the civilized and primitive worlds, to the advantage of the latter. The ""civilized"" trio from the south are foolish, petty and endlessly quarrelsome. They are unable to learn and refuse to accept good advice. They degenerate into callous, cruel behavior to their dogs. The more their troubles accumulate, the worse they behave to each other and to their dogs. They know nothing of what London describes as ""the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore, and remain sweet of speech and kindly.""
	The episode also illustrates Buck's preternatural instincts in refusing to go on the final, fatal trip. He has a wild animal's instinct for danger. However, he is not yet ready to answer fully the call of the wild. In his state of exhaustion and near starvation, he still needs the nurturing care of a human. This he will find in John Thornton, who rescues him.

The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 6,"Summary
	Staying with Thornton during the spring, Buck's strength is restored. He plays with Skeet and Nig, Thornton's dogs, and he also loves Thornton, the man who saved his life. He regards Thornton as the ideal master because he looks after his own dogs as if they were his children. Buck adores him, and goes wild with happiness when Thornton touches him or speaks to him. He does not even like to lose sight of Thornton, since he is afraid of losing him.
	In spite of his faithfulness and devotion, however, Buck retains the wildness that has been growing in him since he was first kidnapped. If a strange dog appears, he fights fiercely, and always prevails. He never shows any mercy. He also hears the call of his wild nature, and apart from Thornton, he no longer has any ties to the human world. It is only Thornton that draws him back. No task is too great for Buck to do for his master. He is even prepared to jump over a cliff when Thornton, on a whim, tells him to.
	Later that year, a man named ""Black"" Burton picks a quarrel with Thornton at a bar. Burton hits him, and is immediately attacked by Buck. He barely escapes with his life, and as a result of his defense of his master, Buck gets a reputation through all the camps in Alaska. Later in the year, Buck saves Thornton from drowning in a bad stretch of rapids on the Forty Mile River.
	That winter, Buck's fame spreads even farther throughout Alaska, when he wins a bet that Thornton makes in a bar. The bet is that Buck can start a sled that weighs a thousand pounds. The test takes place in the street outside the bar, and Buck succeeds in his task, breaking the sled out of the ice and pulling it for one hundred yards. This feat of Buck's wins sixteen hundred dollars for his master. A man then offers to buy Buck for twelve hundred dollars, but Thornton is not interested in selling.
	Analysis
	This chapter appears at first to take Buck in a different direction. Up until now, he has been steadily acclimatizing himself to the harsh Arctic environment and reverting to his primitive nature, hearing more and more the call of the wild. Humans mean much less to him than they used to, when he lived on Judge Miller's ranch, and he obeys them only because of the ""law of club,"" that is, the superior power, of man. But now this appears to turn around. With John Thornton, Buck develops a relationship far closer, and more loving, than anything he had known in the civilized world of the Santa Clara Valley. Perhaps the reason London inserted this chapter here is that he wanted to increase the drama of Buck's final rejection of the human world when it takes place in the last chapter. In order to accomplish this, London has to reestablish Buck's links with humans.
	Having said that, it should also be noted that Buck is a completely different dog with Thornton than he was when he was merely Judge Miller's pet, all those years ago. Buck is now a dog who has come in from the wild and chooses for the time being to stay with a human companion, rather than being a pet who has known nothing other than comfort and human kindness. Buck remains tough, merciless, supreme. And Thornton is Buck's last link with the human world. He does not extend his love or his trust to other humans, to whom he is indifferent, even disdainful. He has not returned to the state of innocence he was in at Judge Miller's, when he trustingly allowed Manuel to sell him into slavery. And despite his new attachment to Thornton, the call of the wild gets stronger and stronger within him and the claims of man slip away. For a while he lives as it were in two worlds, but it is only his attachment to Thornton that prevents the wild from claiming him completely.

The Call of the Wild: Novel Summary: Chapter 7,"Chapter 7
Summary
	The money Buck wins for him enables Thornton to pay off some debts and journey with his partners in search of a fabled lost gold mine that no living man has ever found. They travel east on an unknown trail. Buck enjoys himself like never before. They journey many months but do not find the lost mine. But they do find gold, in a shallow area in a valley, and they collect as much gold dust and nuggets as they can.
	Buck muses by the fire and has more visions of cave men, and he sees himself wandering with the man. He feels the call of the wild, and sometimes pursues it, spending hours in the forest. ""irresistible impulses"" seize him. He hears a wolf howl, and feels an instant kinship with it. When he sees the wolf, the wolf runs, and Buck follows. When Buck corners it, he does not attack, but makes friendly advances. They continue the chase, and finally sniff noses and become friendly. For hours they run together, and Buck knows he is at last answering the call of the wild. But then he remembers Thornton and returns to the camp. For two days he does not leave, but then he hears once more the call of the forest. He starts to wander in the woods, and stays away from the camp for days at a time, hunting and fishing for his food. He exhibits a wild, wolf-like cunning. As a fearsome hunter, he kills a moose by separating it from the herd and remorselessly pursuing and attacking it. He shows great patience and ferocity. It takes him four days to pull the moose down.
	When he returns to Thornton's camp, he finds it has been overrun by Yeehat Indians. The men and dogs are dead, and the Indians are dancing around the wreckage of the lodge. Buck attacks them and kills several of them. The remainder flee in panic, thinking that an evil spirit has come. Buck discovers that Thornton's body is submerged in a pool.
	At night, Buck hears the yelping of the wolves in the forest, and he finds their call more compelling than ever before. With the death of Thornton, the last of his ties to the human world is gone. When Buck encounters the wolf pack, he kills one of them that attacks him. The other wolves attack him, but Buck positions himself well and fights them off. After half an hour, the wolves back off, and one wolf approaches him in a cautious but friendly manner. It is the wolf Buck has met before. They touch noses. One wolf begins to howl, and the others join in, as does Buck. The pack then runs off, and Buck runs with them.
	For years Buck runs in the wild as a wolf. The Yeehats tell of a Ghost Dog that runs at the head of the pack, and they are afraid of him. They know he continues on occasion to kill human hunters. They will not enter the valley where he lives.
	Analysis
	Buck continues to hear the call of the wild, and hears it more strongly than ever. From the moment he meets the wolf, and makes friends with him, he exists in two worlds and two communities: the human one, and the wolf community that he is discovering in his ""wild brother.""
	Perhaps because London wanted to emphasize the depth of Buck's attachment to Thornton, and distinguish it from the former relationship between Buck and Judge Miller, he gives to Buck a second vision of the cave-man, but this time the cave-man is accompanied by Buck. The tie between man and dog, it is implied, goes back to the dawn of the human race, when man, at the mercy of wild beasts, needed dogs for protection. Thus the relationship between Thornton and Buck is as much a product of primitive roots as civilized ones.
	The death of Thornton severs the last ties Buck has to the human world. He now becomes completely wild, running with the pack and establishing his mastery through strength and cunning. He is the living example of the Darwinian law of the survival of the fittest. But London does not present this as a regression to be regretted. Buck has in fact triumphed. He has discovered for himself the ancient springs of his own nature, and is more fully himself than when he was cozy and enjoying himself on the ranch at Judge Miller's, or lazing around the fire at John Thornton's. He is fulfilling the deepest impulses of his own being, and in doing so he acquires an almost mythic status as the Ghost Dog or Evil Spirit of Indian legend.

The Inferno: Novel Summary,"Summary
In the middle of the journey of his life, Dante comes to himself again and realizes he is lost in a dark, savage, threatening forest deep in a valley. He tries all night to find a way out; when he comes to the foot of a high hill and sees the rising sun shining on it, he feels hope and starts to climb. But his way is blocked by three beasts. He thinks he's going to get past the leopard that comes first, but the lion is more fearsome, and the she-wolf drives him back, despairing, to the dark wood. He then sees a human shape and calls out for help. It is the shade of Virgil, the great Roman poet of the time of the emperor Augustus, from whom he as a poet has learned so much, and Dante begs him for help against the she-wolf. Virgil tells him that the she-wolf is too fierce to get by, that she is ravaging all of Italy, and will do so until the person comes who can chase her back to Hell. But Virgil promises to get him out of the dark wood, not by taking him past the beasts, but by leading him through Hell. Once he has seen those who suffer in Hell, Virgil will lead him up the mountain of Purgatory, where souls become ready for eternal bliss, and then someone else will take over and lead him up to Heaven. Virgil can't go there because, living before Christianity had spread, he was not a Christian. Dante accepts Virgil's guidance joyfully, and they set out.
	Analysis
	Dante called his epic poem his Commedia, his comedy, because it had a happy ending and used ordinary language; others soon started calling it The Divine Comedy, and many consider it the greatest poem ever written. Never before had any poet written an epic poem about the poet's own life; epics had always been about heroes, who spent most of their time fighting. Dante writes about a turning point in his own journey, a midlife crisis. He writes about it in the form of an allegory, in which all the inner drama takes on outer form; thus his turmoil and misery are pictured as the state of being lost in a dark forest. So we can say that on the literal level, the Inferno is the story of a man who, with a wise guide, is able to travel down through the pit of Hell step by step, seeing at each level the tortures of the damned, and finally emerging on the other side of the earth to begin an upward climb. (If you share the common notion that people thought the earth was flat before Columbus, put it aside. Anyone with any education knew the earth was round. Even the most learned in the Middle Ages, however, did believe that it was the center of the universe, around which everything else revolved.) On the allegorical level, it is the story of a man who feels completely lost, but with the help of all his own inner wisdom and learning, and the help of divine grace, is able, step by step, to see clearly all those tendencies in himself that are keeping him lost, and so gain the resolution to begin real growth. But the poem is never only about Dante's own inner life. For one thing, there is never just one meaning to Dante's allegory-he said himself that the poem should be read on four levels, as the Bible was read at the time. And Dante cared passionately about the political corruption and turmoil he saw around him; in Hell he's seeing what's behind the troubles of his world. As with every great work, it's also true that scholars often have different interpretations. Inevitably, then, the analyses that follow are just hints, touching a few aspects of the rich meaning of this first part of Dante's great poem. The first eight cantos and a few of the later ones are summarized and discussed somewhat more fully, to orient the reader, but even there, the coverage is skimpy. For more, two good starting places are The Divine Comedy 1: Hell (Penguin, 1949), translated by Dorothy Sayers, and The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation (Farrar, Straus, 1994), by Robert Pinsky, who was Poet Laureate of the United States, 1997-2000. Both have helpful introductions and notes. The Pinsky translation has the original Italian on the facing pages, and the Sayers translation has excellent historical background.
	The drives that threaten to keep Dante-like so many others!-trapped in misery are pictured in the three beasts, sometimes interpreted as embodying Lust, Anger, and Greed. (As for the promised savior, Dante seems to have left his identity deliberately vague.) The Dante of the poem cannot overcome the beasts directly; he must be led by Virgil, a guide who embodies all the wisdom human reason can reach, and especially all the wisdom Dante has learned from the great writers of Greece and Rome. Following that guide, he must see clearly the misery caused by being stuck in attempting to be happy by giving in to lust and anger and greed and other such drives, ignoring the damage done to oneself and others. That misery is revealed in the form of the suffering of those who inhabit the levels of Hell, pictured as a great pit extending down to the center of the earth. Each level reveals the essence of a different kind of sin. The story of Dante's journey down through all those levels is told in the Inferno. After that journey, Dante will be ready, again with Virgil as guide, to understand the joy of growth, of burning away all that comes between him and real happiness, and that is the story of the second part of Dante's Divine Comedy, the Purgatorio. But Virgil cannot guide him to Heaven. Dante accepted the teaching of the Christian Church of his day that only Christ had revealed and opened the way to the love and forgiveness offered by God. The story of Dante's journey up through Heaven to a taste of the joy of feeling his own will one with ""the love that moves the sun and the other stars"" (the last line of the whole poem) is told in the Paradiso, the third part of the Divine Comedy.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 2,"Summary
	Dante and Virgil have set out, and Dante the narrator invokes the Muses to help him tell the story, as epic poets have always done. But the first thing he has to tell shows how very unheroic, at least in some ways, is the ""hero"" he has chosen: Dante the pilgrim hesitates. Who is he to undertake such a journey? Yes, others have journeyed through the Underworld or visited Heaven-Aeneas, whose story Virgil himself told in his epic poem, the Aeneid, and St. Paul. But Dante's not on their level, he tells Virgil. Virgil diagnoses Dante's problem as cowardice, and tells him the story of the blessed and beautiful lady, Beatrice, who came to Virgil in Limbo, the outermost part of Hell where he inhabits, to urge him to save Dante. She came from Heaven, through the grace of the Virgin Mary and St. Lucy, Dante's favorite saint, and if three such ladies want to save Dante, how can he hesitate? And indeed Dante feels new courage spread through his whole being and tells Virgil he is really ready to follow him now.
	Analysis
	In some allegories, the characters are not real people but personified abstractions, as in the pictures of Justice as a blind woman holding scales, or the Statue of Liberty holding up her torch in New York's harbor. In Dante's allegory, almost all the characters are real people. (The three beasts of the first canto are an exception.) They are themselves, and they stand for something more, in part for some inner quality that in life they really did embody, at least in Dante's opinion. In life, Beatrice was a young woman who grew up, as Dante did, in Florence, in the late thirteenth century, and died young. When she was eight and Dante was nine, he saw her for the first time at a May celebration. So powerful was her effect on him, then and later, that he came to see her as a revelation of the glory of God, sent to draw him to God. For him, she embodied Divine Grace and all the power of Revelation, which reveals God's love to us in a way human reason on its own could never reach. So one can see this canto as saying, ""Human reason can show us how futile it is to seek happiness in the wrong direction and how joyful to seek it through real growth, but it can never grasp the bliss that is waiting for us when our wills are completely guided by universal love."" Many who do not share Dante's theology, especially the doctrine that some souls will stay trapped in the misery they have created for themselves on earth forever in Hell, have still found much real insight in his psychology. For some, the Inferno is above all a study of the hell of addiction, as it is experienced in this life.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 3,"Summary
	The dire words inscribed over the gate of Hell, which end with the famous words, ""Abandon hope, all ye who enter here"" (line 9), again frighten Dante, and Virgil has to comfort him again, telling him he must give up fear-the words only apply to those who, being dead, are no longer able to choose to turn to God. Once inside the gate he hears the groans of those who, while they were alive, refused to risk choosing either good or evil. They are in a large and undefined area, sometimes called the Vestibule, or Fore-Hell. As Virgil explains, they don't belong in Hell because they lacked the courage to choose evil; if they were in Hell, even the damned would look down on them. They endlessly follow a banner that never takes a stand anywhere, and Dante is amazed how many there are: ""I could never have believed that death had undone so many"" (lines 56-57). Then Dante and Virgil come to the river Acheron, where a great crowd of people wait to cross. Charon, the boatman, at first says that Dante, being alive, cannot cross, but Virgil tells him that Dante's journey is willed by God, and Charon accepts that. The souls who are waiting to cross curse God and their parents and all the circumstances of their lives. Dante is then deprived of consciousness by a sudden movement of the earth and an intense red flash.
	Analysis
	Here for the first time the outer state of a group of souls after death is described in a way that reveals something about the nature of their inner state; in the same way, all the punishments of Hell, described in such graphic detail, are intended to help the reader see the real nature of the choices the souls have made, the truth about what those choices have done to them, or, to put it in other terms, the essence of their sin, which is now their punishment. Seeing the downward way clearly, as it is, is intended to give the reader, like Dante, the courage to choose the upward way. The suffering of the souls in this Fore-Hell reveal what it does to human beings to refuse to make real choices, to lack the courage to try to be happy, even by choosing to do harm to themselves and others. They follow meaningless causes with no real commitment, and their lives are utterly forgotten. Dante sees among these souls someone who is probably meant to be Celestine V, a pope who refused the risk of staying in office and turned over the papacy to Boniface VIII. Dante blamed Boniface for much of the corruption he saw in the church, and for the disaster that had come on his own beloved city, Florence. Seeing the man whose cowardice put Boniface in office, Dante really understands it-to refuse to act is the worst choice of all.
	The souls who are waiting to cross Acheron made, while they were alive, the choice to turn their backs on God. They now blame everyone for that choice except themselves, something we will often see in the lower circles.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 4,"Summary
	Dante wakes up and finds himself ""on the brink of the abysmal valley of pain"" (lines 7-8). So pitiful are the wailings that rise from that dark valley that Virgil's face is pale with pity, and Dante takes it for fear and hesitates again. But Virgil explains, and they enter the First Circle, also called Limbo. Here there are only sighs, no wailing, and the only suffering, says Virgil, who dwells in this circle, is that ""without hope, we live in desire"" (line 42); all the souls here were virtuous, or at least free of sin, but they were never brought into the Christian Church through baptism, either because they lived before Christianity like Virgil, or because the teachings of Christianity never reached them, or because they died before they could be baptized. Dante is full of grief at hearing this. Has no one ever escaped this circle? Virgil answers that a great conqueror came here shortly after Virgil died and set free Adam, Noah, Moses, and many others.
	Virgil and Dante then come to an area full of light, where those dwell who have won honorable fame and are therefore favored by Heaven. Virgil is welcomed back to this place, which is his home, by the shades of Homer and three other great poets, and all five accept Dante as one of themselves. They walk on to a noble castle, inside of which is a fresh green meadow, and there Dante sees many men and women of Greece and Rome famous for their deeds, as well as the great Muslim leader Saladin, and then the great philosophers of the ancient world, as well as the two Muslim thinkers Avicenna and Averroes, who transmitted much ancient wisdom (including deeper insight into the philosophy of Aristotle) to western Europe.
	Finally Virgil and Dante leave, and he comes out of that quiet and bright place ""to a part where there is no light"" (line 141).
	Analysis
	It has seemed strange to many that the noble souls and the innocent infants in the First Circle must be imagined as having crossed Acheron, along with those sinners who blamed everyone else for their misery. In the Paradiso, Dante the pilgrim gets to ask some questions he's been brooding about, and one of them is how it can be right for virtuous people to be denied the chance to get to Heaven just because they lacked baptism. So we know the question troubled him, and perhaps that trouble is reflected here. One interpretation is that Dante believed it was possible to be virtuous without being able to conceive of God as Universal Love, and that in fact only Christ could reveal that truth. What we cannot know, we cannot choose, and in life after death as Dante conceived of it, people have what they chose while alive. And if we consider the allegorical meaning, the nature of Limbo makes clear that to live even a good and honorable life without knowledge of the true nature of ultimate reality as love and bliss is to live without joy, desiring something more but having no hope of getting it.
	The story Virgil tells of a mighty one carrying away souls from Hell reflects the medieval belief that when Christ ""descended into Hell,"" as the Apostle's Creed states, he ""harrowed"" Hell, defeating Satan and freeing all those who had believed in Christ before his birth.
	Clearly, Dante reverenced all those he here depicts as dwelling in the noble castle, and he is pictured here as honored to be treated as an equal by the five great classical poets. Dante saw himself as restoring poetry to the high level of the achievements of Greece and Rome, and he announces his role here.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 5,"Summary
	When he first enters the Second Circle, Dante sees Minos, a horrible, snarling demon to whom each soul confesses everything, receiving their sentence from him. Minos warns Dante to turn back, but Virgil again asserts that Dante's journey is divinely ordained.
	Now Dante hears wailing again, in a place where light is mute. A hellish storm drives the spirits ceaselessly through the air like a flock of birds, tormenting them; they have no hope of rest, no hope of less pain. One long line of spirits draws Dante's attention, and he asks Virgil who they are. Virgil tells him of more than a thousand, ""ladies of ancient times and warriors,"" all having died because of love, and Dante is bewildered by pity.
	Dante asks to speak to two who are borne on the wind together, and who ""seem so light on the wind."" Virgil tells him to ask them to come in the name of their love; they swoop down to him like doves borne to their nest by desire. The woman speaks, full of gratitude for Dante's kind interest, and says that all-powerful Love brought them together and holds them together still. Love led to their dying together, and the deepest pit of Hell is waiting for the man who killed them. Dante recognizes her as Francesca and knows the story of her husband finding her with his brother Paolo and killing them both, and he stands silent with head bowed, thinking of the power of the desire that has brought the two lovers here. Telling Francesca that her suffering makes him weep, he asks how she and Paolo first realized they were in love. She tells how they were reading together of Lancelot's love for Guinevere, and ""when we read that the smile so desired was kissed by so great a lover, this man, who will never be parted from me, kissed my mouth, all trembling. A Galeotto [pander, go-between] was that book and the man who wrote it; that day we read no more"" (lines 133-138). As Francesca speaks, Paolo weeps so bitterly that Dante faints from sheer pity.
	Analysis
	This canto is one of the most famous in Dante's Inferno, creating strong reactions in just about everyone who reads it. Paolo and Francesca had been killed only a few years before the year of Dante's journey through the worlds of the afterlife (which he set in 1300), and everyone in Italy at the time knew their story. Some later readers have felt that Dante is showing them as victorious over Hell, since they will be together forever. Others have felt that Dante is showing Francesca as self-deceiving and selfish. What is clear is that Dante is showing himself, at this stage in the journey, as deeply sympathetic with the lovers. We find out in the Purgatorio that he himself tended to be overmastered by desire, and certainly the romantic literature of his day, which he loved, tended to present romantic love as all-powerful and to excuse those who were led by it to break their marriage vows. At the same time, Dante the narrator makes the nature of the punishment reveal the essence of the sin, as so often in the poem: as all those who suffer in the Second Circle allowed themselves to be swept away by passion while they were alive, ignoring the harm they were doing to themselves and others, so now they are swept away forever by a black wind.
	At the same time, it is worth noting that those who give in to their passions and desires, who are, in that sense, incontinent-they cannot contain their impulses-are on the highest levels in Hell, the Circles of Incontinence. The giving in to lust seen in this Second Circle, which at least involves some kind of feeling for another person, is the least serious of all the sins-though it is still mortal. It can kill the soul if one does not realize that this kind of love cannot give real happiness, if one becomes addicted to it.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 6,"Summary
	During his swoon, Dante has somehow been transported to the Third Circle, where cold, dirty rain mixed with hail and snow pours down forever, and the soil stinks. There three-headed Cerberus barks at and tortures the souls, who lie in the mud. Virgil is able to silence him by throwing dirt in his mouth. As Virgil and Dante pass on, one soul sits up and asks Dante if he recognizes him. He is so disfigured that Dante doesn't, but the soul tells him he lived in Dante's city, Florence, so ruined by envy, was called Ciacco (Hog); all the souls in this circle were taken over by gluttony, as he was. Dante expresses his pity for Ciacco, then wants to know is what's going to happen in Florence. Ciacco tells him that the Whites will soon come to power and exile the Blacks, but not for long; the Blacks, with the help of Boniface VIII, will come back and banish the Whites, and stay in power for a long time. There are only two just men in the whole city, and no one listens to them; all the others are ruled by pride, envy, and greed. What about the good men who have held power in Florence in the past, Dante asks. Are they now in Heaven or Hell. You'll see them lower down in Hell, Ciacco answers. Then he makes his one request, that Dante should speak of him when he returns to ""the sweet world"" and so keep his memory alive; he sinks back into the mire with the others, to rise no more, Virgil says, till all souls are reunited with their bodies on Judgment Day. Dante wants to know what effect reuniting with their bodies will have on their suffering, and Virgil explains that it will make it worse. They continue their journey around the circle, until, at the point where the path heads down again, they encounter ""Plutus, the great enemy.""
	Analysis
	The true nature of gluttony is revealed by the lonely wallowing in the mud of the gluttonous souls, and Dante doesn't need to ask Virgil or the soul they meet about it. Rather for the first time, but not the last, the focus is on what is about to happen in Florence. Dante loved his city, then an independent republic, and he was recognized there as a poet and respected as a citizen, even elected to office in 1300. (The two parties that had earlier torn apart Florence with their battles earlier were the Guelphs and the Ghibellines; the Guelphs had triumphed decisively in 1267, and Dante's family was Guelph.) Beatrice had died young, and Dante was married to someone else and had four children. It was during this prosperous and successful time of his life that he chose to set his book, describing himself as beginning his escape from the Dark Wood by descending into Hell on Good Friday of 1300. By this time, the Guelphs had split into the Blacks and the Whites. In Dante's actual life, the banishment of the Whites that Ciacco predicts, which actually happened in 1301, was the beginning of his own exile, since he was a White. The Blacks accused him on trumped-up charges of graft and threatened him and other powerful Whites with death by burning if they ever returned to Florence.
	Exile from Florence was a horrible blow to Dante; its shadow hangs over the whole Divine Comedy. In a sense, the poem is the story of how he became the kind of man who could lose everything and yet give his whole life to serving God and saving his country from the turmoil and corruption he saw everywhere in Florence and in all of Italy. His way of serving was to create a supreme poem to call his fellow Italians back to the true way of gaining happiness, the way he had had to go through Hell to find. So the Divine Comedy is, in part, a poem about a poet becoming ready to write this poem. And Hell is in part a picture of the rottenness and corruption that led to Dante's exile-even the Florentines he admired most in real life, are, Ciacco tells Dante in this canto, utterly cut off from God in eternity, as they were in life. Dante depicts the souls in Hell as able to know the future, but unable to see what is happening in the present in the living world, and so he is able to put in the mouths of the souls in Hell clearer and clearer prophecies of the approaching disaster that will end in his banishment.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 7,"Summary
	Plutus (in ancient mythology the god of wealth) is a demonic ""cruel beast"" serving Satan, and he must be a horrible sight, since Virgil has to reassure a fearful Dante that Plutus cannot stop them from descending to the next circle. As he has before, Virgil tells Plutus that Dante's descent into Hell is willed in Heaven, and Plutus collapses. They descend to the Fourth Circle, and Dante sees two groups of souls endlessly rolling great stones at each other and taunting each other, one group yelling, ""Why do you hoard?"" and the other, ""Why do you squander?"" Both have given their whole attention to wealth, whether keeping it for themselves or spending it recklessly. Many of the hoarders are former popes and cardinals, Virgil tells Dante, and Dante says he ought to be able to recognize some of them. No, says Virgil, in life they couldn't distinguish what really matters, and now no one can distinguish who they are. Fortune rules who is wealthy and who is poor, but human beings waste their lives in their concern for wealth; not even the greatest wealth could bring them any rest now.
	Dante wants to know who Fortune is, and Virgil pictures her as an angelic intelligence ordained by God to regulate which nations have power and wealth, and for how long. Human beings curse her, but she does not hear them-she blissfully turns her wheel.
	At the edge of this circle they find a gloomy river, which flows into a marsh called Styx. There Dante sees people in rage attacking each other, hitting each other with their hands and bodies and tearing each other with their teeth. Virgil explains that these souls were completely taken over by anger against others while alive. If their anger was directed against themselves, that is, if they were sullen, they are trapped under water, where they say forever, ""We were sullen in the sweet air that rejoices in the sun, carrying within ourselves a sluggish smoke; now we are sullen in the black mire"" (lines 121-124). Virgil and Dante then go around the circle, beside the marsh, to the foot of a tower.
	Analysis
	The Fourth Circle is one of just three in all the circles of Hell in which Dante recognizes no one, so deeply did he feel that a life of concern with getting and spending destroys the soul. What he does recognize is how many leaders of the Church are in this circle; no wonder the world goes wrong, he says later in Purgatory, if those who are supposed to guide us all to the bliss of union with God are themselves obsessed with material things.
	One allegorical meaning that can be seen in the descending levels so far is a kind of psychological analysis of how one problem leads to another. Those who are set on gaining happiness by self-indulgence may begin by having some kind of concern for others, as in the Second Circle, but they are apt to sink into solitary self-indulgence, like the gluttonous in the Third Circle, and then to join together only in hostility, as the hoarders and spenders join to attack each other here in the Fourth Circle. Finally, like the wrathful and sullen in the Stygian marsh, which is also the Fifth Circle, they feel nothing but resentment and rage, whether directed at others or themselves.
	One of the touches that lightens the darkness of the Inferno is the reminder here of the beauty that the angry and sullen have turned their backs on: the beauty of ""the sweet air that rejoices in the sun.""
	Another such touch is the description given here of Fortune. Traditionally, she was pictured as a blind woman turning a wheel-random luck running, often ruining, human lives. Dante had thought that way himself, his life having been, as he felt, so unjustly ruined. But here Fortune is not blind, but a serene and blessed angelic intelligence carrying out God's will on earth.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 8,"Summary
	When Dante and Virgil come to the foot of the tower, they see two lights shining from it, and another light in the distance flashing in reply. Dante wants to know what's going on, and Virgil points out something coming toward them across the marsh. It's a little boat, and the demon who steers it, Phlegyas, gloats, thinking Dante is an evil soul that has come into his power, then swells with held-in rage when Virgil tells him they are only going to cross. Virgil gets in the boat first, but it is only when Dante gets in that the boat sinks lower in the water.
	As they cross, one of the spirits wallowing in the mire asks Dante who he is. Dante recognizes him and feels no pity: Filippo Argenti is where he belongs. Filippo reaches out toward the boat, but Virgil pushes him away, and blesses Dante for his indignation, saying that this man was utterly arrogant while he lived and is now furious because no good is remembered of him. Many now living who think they are great kings will meet the same fate. Dante wants to see Filippo thrust deeper into the mire, and his wish is fulfilled when the whole crowd of angry souls attack Filippo, and he even attacks himself.
	Now Dante hears more sounds of grief and gazes intently forward. Virgil tells him that they are approaching the mighty city of Dis. Dante sees its mosques, lit by the glow of the eternal fire within. They come to the gates of Dis and get out of the boat, and above the gates they see a host of fallen angels, who say that no living man may enter here. They invite Virgil to come, and tell Dante he must go back alone, if he can. Now Dante is really scared, and he begs Virgil not to go, but Virgil says their entering can't be stopped, and promises not to forsake Dante. He goes to talk to the fallen angels, now devils; Dante can't hear what they're saying, but he sees them slam the gates shut in Virgil's face. Virgil comes back with all his self-confidence gone, but he assures Dante that even now someone is on the way down the steps of Hell to open the gates of the city.
	Analysis
	The way Dante weighs down the boat reminds us-he is a living human being, still in his body, while the others are bodiless shades. He can still choose; he is not stuck. It's interesting that, even in traditions where there's a belief in reincarnation, being in a human body is thought of as giving a unique opportunity for spiritual growth.
	The scene with Filippo Argenti has horrified many readers. What kind of Christianity is this? Could it be, some ask, that Dante the pilgrim is being shown as affected by Hell, taking on the sins he condemns? One answer that has been given is that on the literal level, all the pilgrim's reactions to the souls in Hell are reflections of their own state, as though to underline that they can only have what they chose while they were alive. Allegorically, it's easier-Dante for the first time sees his own tendency to violent, destructive anger and summons up the energy of righteous anger to reject it. As for the political meaning, Filippo was a Florentine, and he was typical of the arrogant and violent aristocrats who were doing Florence so much damage.
	The city of Dis consists of all the rest of Hell: the walls of Dis go all the way around the pit. Only within these walls does the fire of Hell burn. Allegorically, on the personal level, this is the point where Dante must begin to confront, not just his tendencies to give in to lust or anger and so on, but his actual, willed choice to do harm to others and himself, turning his back on the love that he believes has been revealed to him through Christ-and Beatrice. Virgil's help is not enough, when it comes to facing this truth about himself.
	Dante sees the ""mosques"" of the city of Dis. We saw earlier that Dante could revere the valor and wisdom of three great Muslims, Saladin, Avicenna, and Averroes, but here we see that he shared the belief that prevailed in his day, that Islam was a willed, deliberate turning away from the love revealed in Christ, a ""heresy."" From that point of view, mosques are what one would expect to find in the city of Dis.

	Seeing Dante's fear, Virgil tries to appear confident, and he listens attentively for some indication that the promised help is near. He still seems worried-the help seems so long in coming! And if it doesn't . . . . Dante imagines the worst, and asks whether anyone from the First Circle, where Virgil dwells, has ever come down this far. Virgil answers that he himself was once conjured by a witch to go down to the very depth of Hell and bring back a shade, so he does indeed know the way, and Dante shouldn't worry.
	But now Dante sees on the tower before them the three Furies, in the shape of women with snakes for hair, raging and threatening to bring out the gorgon Medusa, whose gaze would turn Dante to stone. Virgil orders Dante to turn around and covers Dante's eyes with his hands, since if Dante were once to see Medusa, he would never return to the light of day.
	Then over the waves comes a fearful sound, as of a mighty wind striking a forest, and Virgil drops his hands and urges Dante to look. Indignant, yet calm and untouched, an angel is crossing the marsh, and he opens the gate easily and reproaches the fallen angels with vainly resisting God's will. Then he goes on his way, and Dante and Virgil enter secure.
	Once inside the gates, Dante sees a great plain covered with tombs, and the tombs are made red hot by the flames that surround them. The lids of the tombs are open, and Dante hears the groans of those within. Virgil explains that they are all heretics.
	Analysis
	Medusa the gorgon is a symbol of despair, and despair can easily seize on those who first realize they have chosen their own misery. A realization of a deeper force that wills growth and joy is needed here.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 10,"Summary
	Dante wants to know whether it's possible to speak to the souls in the tombs, and Virgil explains that they are now in the section of the Sixth Circle where lie those heretics who believed that the soul dies with the body, and soon his wish will be granted. Farinata, a Florentine of earlier times whom Dante greatly respected, even though he was of a different party, a Ghibelline, rises erect in his tomb, seeming to scorn Hell, and speaks to Dante, asking who his ancestors were. Hearing their names, he says they were his and his party's enemies, and he drove them out twice. Yes, says Dante, but they came back; the Ghibellines haven't learned that art. Just then, the shade beside Farinata rises up, having recognized Dante. If you're allowed to come here because you're such a good poet, why isn't my son Guido Cavalcanti with you? Perhaps your Guido scorned the blessed lady I'm being led toward, answers Dante. Isn't my son still alive, the father cries, and when Dante doesn't immediately answer, he falls back in despair. Farinata ignores him and goes on where they were interrupted. The pain of hearing that the Ghibellines haven't been able to return is, he says, worse than the pain of Hell. But soon Dante will learn how hard it is to learn the art of returning after being banished. After asking Farinata to tell Guido's father that his son is still alive, Dante goes on with Virgil brooding about Farinata's ominous words, and Virgil assures him Beatrice will tell him all his fate. Then they come to the brink of the next level, and a foul stench rises up from it.
	Analysis
	The heretics have all rejected truths Dante believed they really knew deserved to be believed. The example here, of those who deny the immortality of the soul, is a good one-as far as Dante knew, everyone with any claim to wisdom, whether pagan or Christian, had always been sure of the immortality of the soul. The best analogy would be someone who refuses to believe that pollution is a problem, even though he lives in a city where the air is so bad that his asthma tortures him. He's not going to be swept along, just because everyone else believes something.
	Some have thought that Dante really, even if unconsciously, wants us to admire Farinata, to see him as so strong he can scorn Hell. Others point out that he is so ""strong,"" he feels no compassion for the man beside him in the tomb.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 11,"Summary
	The stench of the next circle is so bad that Dante and Virgil have to wait until they get used to it before they can go on. Virgil uses the time to explain to Dante the plan of the rest of Hell, so that he won't need each circle explained to him-he'll see the souls and their sufferings, and he'll understand. After Virgil has explained, Dante asks how the people outside the wall fit in, and Virgil reproaches him for not remembering his Aristotle (the great authority in philosophy in the Middle Ages) any better than that. Weakness of will is of course a less serious offense than deliberate wrongdoing, but it still offends God.
	Analysis
	The easiest way to get the plan of Hell straight is to make yourself a map that you can keep in front of you, or to consult the maps in one of the editions of Dante. In Outer Hell, as we discussed before, are first the righteous unbaptized, and then those who simply gave in to their impulses, the incontinent. There are five circles in all in Outer Hell: the Second Circle for the lustful, the Third for the gluttonous, the Fourth for the hoarders and spendthrifts, and the Fifth for the wrathful. Within the walls of the city of Dis, which can be seen as symbolizing the hardened will that deliberately chooses to go wrong, are four circles. The Sixth Circle holds the heretics. The Seventh holds those who used violence to do wrong, the Eighth, those who used the divine gift of reason to practice fraud against other human beings in general, and the Ninth, those who used fraud against those they were especially bound to, in other words, the traitors. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Circles are all subdivided. The first round of the Seventh Circle holds those who used violence against the lives and property of other human beings, the second, those who used violence against themselves, whether by suicide or by destroying their own property (felt at that time to be an extension of oneself), and the third, those who used violence against God, whether directly, by blaspheming God, or by using violence against God's creation, against the natural order of things, by engaging in usury or sodomy. Each kind of simple fraud, which simply violates the bond of love that naturally unites all human beings, has its own place in the Eighth Circle. In the Ninth Circle, those who violate the special bonds that create a special trust are separated according to the bond they trampled on by their treachery.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 12,"Summary
	A sheer mountainside leads down to the Seventh Circle; they can only get down it where a landslide has shattered the rocks, but just there stands the Minotaur, half man, half bull. Virgil enrages him by taunting him with his defeat at the hands of Theseus, and they slip by while he writhes in rage. At the foot of the cliff is a river of boiling blood, in which all those who shed the blood of others suffer. Centaurs, half man, half horse, guard the banks, and they courteously help Virgil and Dante. The centaur who goes with them carries Dante on his back, so that he can get across the river, and points out the famous sinners who boil there. Deepest in the river are the tyrants and conquerors, such as Alexander and Attila, and recent tyrants of cities in Italy who had been notorious for their violence.
	Analysis
	Dante does not speak of Alexander as Alexander the Great; the ""glory"" Alexander and his fellow tyrants won is lost in a river of blood, and they are distinguished from murderers and burglars by being plunged deeper in the river. As for the courteous centaurs, it has been suggested that many who at that time made Italy miserable by their violence seemed courteous and noble in person, but in Dante's eyes their violence made them less than human.

	The centaur leaves them on the farther shore of the river of boiling blood, and they set out through a strange, barren woods of trees with dingy leaves and poisonous thorns, where Harpies, half human, half bird, lament. This is the second round, Virgil tells Dante. Dante hears wailing but sees no one and is bewildered. Virgil tells him to break off a twig from one of the trees; immediately blood and a voice come out of the wound, asking why Dante is adding to his torment. The speaker turns out to be a famous statesman and poet named Pier delle Vigne, who had served an emperor and been imprisoned on charges of treachery. He killed himself in despair. Now he explains that he had never betrayed his master, and is glad to think that Dante will tell the truth about him when he returns to the world of living souls. He tells how those who have been violent against their own bodies here become thorn trees, and even at the Last Judgment will not again enter their bodies-only each dead body will be hung on the tree of the soul who threw it away. Then crashing through the woods, wounding all the trees on their way, come two of those here punished for wantonly throwing away all their own goods and destroying their lives that way, pursued by great black hounds who tear them apart.
	Analysis
	Those in this strange and eerie wood re-suffer the violence they inflicted on themselves forever. Much as Dante admired and pitied Pier delle Vigne, he did not feel he could show him as being spared the fate he had chosen when he killed himself, so the story goes, by dashing his head against the wall of his cell.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 14-15,"Summary
	Dante and Virgil emerge from the wood to see a plain of dry and barren sand, where souls, some lying, some sitting, some continually moving, try in vain to escape an endless rain of flakes of fire. First they hear the proud Capaneus boasting as he lies in torment on the sand that he does not weep to show that Jove cannot subdue him. Virgil tells Capaneus that his pride is in fact the worst part of his punishment. Then they see a great stream coming out of the wood, and Virgil explains that its source is the weeping of a giant Old Man who stands in a mountain in Crete. His head is gold, his chest and arms are silver, the rest of his torso is brass, and his legs are iron, except that one foot is clay. Below the head a crack begins that drips tears, and from those tears come all the rivers that torment the souls in Hell. Dante and Virgil are able to cross the burning sands by staying close to the stream.
	On the way they meet a band of those who are continually moving, among them one Dante knows, Brunetto Latini. Dante greets him with reverence. Brunetto obscurely foretells the perils that are waiting for Dante, and encourages him to scorn those who attack him. Dante speaks of his gratitude to Brunetto for teaching him the way to immortal fame. Brunetto must leave to rejoin the group he is with, and Dante sees him run ahead, and thinks he looks like a winning runner.
	Analysis
	One blasphemer speaks for all, in Capaneus. To reject and defy the supreme power in the universe, however one conceives of it, may sound impressive, but it is absurd. The Old Man of Crete embodies the tragedy of human history, his head of gold symbolizing the world before the Fall, his foot of clay the corrupt papacy of Dante's own day. Those who move around on the sand are the sodomites, and here again Dante the narrator shows Dante the pilgrim respecting deeply someone whose corruption is indicated by his place in Hell. Dante shares the beliefs of his age about the order of nature as created by God and sinned against by those who engage in a kind of sexuality that cannot lead to the conception of a child. The sterility of all kinds of violence against God and nature is imaged in the burning sand.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 16-17,"Summary
	Three Florentines call out to Dante to wait until they can catch up with him, and Virgil says he must be courteous to them. And indeed, once Dante learns their names, he wishes he could come down where they are and embrace them. Only his fear of being burned and baked stops him. They fear he will despise them, but Dante says he feels only grief for them, and that all his life he has admired them for their good deeds in Florence. They want to know if there is any courtesy and valor left in Florence, and Dante cries out that the recent new wealth in Florence has created such arrogance, such excess, that Florence is already weeping. They leave, asking only that he should speak of them when he ""returns to see the beautiful stars"" (line 83), and Virgil and Dante go on to another precipice, down which a might river pours. Dante is wearing a cord, with which he had once hoped to catch the Leopard (of Canto 1), and Virgil throws it down into the abyss. Dante warns us he's about to tell us something incredible: He sees through the murky air a strange and terrifying figure come swimming up.
	Virgil announces him as Fraud, the beast that corrupts the world. His face looks an honest man's, he has the body of a serpent, and at the end of his tail is a poisonous sting. As they go toward the beast, whose name is Geryon, Dante sees a group of people sitting on the sand, and Virgil sends him to look at them while Virgil talks to Geryon, so that he will carry them down into the abyss. The usurers sit there on the burning sand, trying to brush away the falling flakes of flame. Dante does not recognize their faces, but each one has a purse hung round his neck at which he is staring, and on each purse is the coat of arms of a well-known Florentine family. Dante speaks to no one. When he comes back, Virgil is already mounted on Geryon. Dante trembles all over when told to climb on, but for shame he does so, though he is too scared to bring out the words to ask Virgil to hang onto him well. But Virgil does hold onto him, as he has before, and orders Geryon to fly down slowly, with this unusual burden on him. Down circling and circling through the dark air they go, until finally Dante sees such fires and hears such wailing that he shrinks back in fear. Geryon sets them down and quickly flies out of sight.
	Analysis
	Dante clearly despises most those who care only for money and who exploit others to get it, especially when, as aristocrats, they should be noble leaders. They are very near the abyss of fraud. Still, theirs is still basically a sin of violence, in this case against the natural order that rewards real work with money. They simply manipulate money to make money, and the teaching of the Church in Dante's day was that that was a sin. Deliberate, willed fraud is far, far lower than any of the sins of violence. That depth is perfectly conveyed in the long, slow, wheeling flight of Geryon down into the abyss.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 18,"Summary
	Dante tells us the shape of the Eighth Circle; he calls it Malebolge, evil pouches. Each ""pouch,"" or bolgia, goes all the way around the yet deeper pit that yawns in the center, and each one holds a different kind of sinner. Dante and Virgil cross each bolgia by a spur of rock that forms a bridge over it. Around the bottom of the First Pouch, lashed by horned demons, go the panders and seducers. Among the panders in the First Bolgia is someone Dante recognizes who confesses that is true that he made his sister sleep with a powerful nobleman, and among the seducers is Jason, the ""hero"" who brought back the Golden Fleece to Greece, using and leaving several women in the process. In the Second Bolgia, plunged in what looks and smells like excrement from human outhouses, are the flatterers.
	Analysis
	No one in either of these bolgias asks to be remembered when Dante returns to the world; their sins, which involve either betraying innocent women or using the uniquely human gift of speech to manipulate rather than to tell the truth, are too vile. Dante and Virgil do not linger.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 19,"Summary
	Dante begins by an outburst against Simon Magus and those who imitate him, buying or selling holy things. Their place is in the Third Bolgia, where they are planted upside down in fiery holes, with only their lower legs and feet, whose soles are licked by flame, sticking out. Dante delights in the perfection of this punishment. He speaks to one of the souls, and it answers, ""Boniface, are you already here?"" Dante quickly denies that he is Boniface, and the shade tells its story. In life, he was a pope who cared only to make money out of his office, and Boniface is going to be thrust into this hole on top of him, driving him deeper down, and then not long after another pope will arrive who has been even worse. Dante speaks with bitter sarcasm-how much money did Christ ask from St. Peter before he gave him the keys? And he tells the pope he would speak even more harshly if he did not reverence the office of pope, since the avarice of the popes and other churchmen who worship gold and silver rather than God has filled the whole world with evil. Virgil looks pleased with Dante for speaking the truth.
	Analysis
	This sin, called simony from Simon Magus, the magician who tried to buy spiritual power from Peter, according to the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament, demands Dante's full attention, his full indignation. These men, who should be leading others to Heaven, have put earth above Heaven; no wonder they are upside down.
	This is the only time Boniface VIII's name is actually mentioned in Hell; it's a perfect touch that it is spoken by one of the damned, with a clear prophecy that Boniface will soon be arriving.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 20,"Summary
	In the Fourth Bolgia, Dante sees those who used magic arts, especially the diviners, who foretold the future, moving endlessly around weeping with their heads set backwards on their bodies. Dante weeps for pity to see the human form so distorted, but Virgil rebukes him for grieving at the carrying out of God's justice, and urges him to look, as he points out all the famous prophets from classical myth and history-they tried to look too far ahead, and now they must look only behind. One of the ancient diviners is the woman for whom Mantua, Virgil's native city, was named, and Virgil tells the true story of her role in its founding. Virgil ends by pointing out some famous medieval wizards and fortune-tellers, as well as a crowd of ordinary women who cast spells and told fortunes.
	Analysis
	In her edition of the Inferno, Dorothy Sayers interprets the basic sin described in this canto as trying to manipulate the material world in the service of the ego. Another way of seeing it is as an obsession with trying to know the future as a way of giving the ego an illusion of knowledge and control. Other interpreters point out how much deception and trickery was involved in the kinds of attempts to know the future that were popular in Dante's time-and perhaps not only then?

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 21-22,"Summary
	In the Fifth Bolgia, Dante sees boiling pitch. Dante looks at it so intently that he doesn't see the black devil coming toward them, and Virgil has to call a warning and pull Dante toward him. The devil is carrying a town official from Lucca, and calls out to another devil to throw the official into the pitch, while he goes back for more: they are all grafters there. Virgil tells Dante to hide, and goes out across the bridge to deal with the demons. They want to attack, but when the leader hears that his and Dante's journey is divinely willed, he orders the rest to let them pass. Virgil calls out to Dante to come, telling him he's safe, but Dante has his doubts. For good reason. They all have hooks, which they use to catch sinners and plunge them deeper into the pitch, and as Dante goes by, one wants to give Dante a little jab on his butt, and another cheers him on. The leader restrains them, and tells Virgil that here the bridge over the next bolgia is broken, but there's another unbroken bridge, and he'll send an escort of devils along to take them to it. Dante begs Virgil not to accept the escort-he'd feel much safer with just Virgil, given the way the devils are looking at him, but Virgil tells him they're just glaring at the souls in the pitch, and he should have no fear. So the group sets out, each devil saluting the captain by sticking out his tongue; he acknowledges their salutes by making a trumpet of his ass.
	Dante has seen many military maneuvers, he tells us, and heard all sorts of signals, but never from a trumpet like that! As they move on with their strange escort, Dante keeps his eyes on the pitch. Occasionally he sees the back of a sinner who has jumped out of the pitch like a dolphin for some relief from the pitch, and then he sees a group of sinners lying half out with their heads on the bank. One doesn't get back in quickly enough and is caught by one of the devils. They are about to rip him apart, but they allow Virgil to question him first, to satisfy Dante's curiosity about who he is and who his companions are. He answers at great length, naming several famous grafters in high position. He then offers to bring some Florentines for Dante to talk to. If the devils will just draw back out of sight, he'll whistle, the signal the souls here use to let each other know when the coast is clear. The devils are suspicious, but he convinces them he just wants to have the fun of getting his friends in trouble, and they withdraw. Instantly he dives, pursued in vain by the devil who decided for trusting him, and then another devil in rage flies after the first, attacks him, and they both end up in the pitch. While the others are trying to get them out, Dante and Virgil move on.
	Analysis
	Since Dante was accused of graft (or barratry, to use the more technical term) by the Blacks who took over Florence, condemning him to banishment on pain of death when he did not come back to stand trial, these cantos are generally interpreted as a farcical account of the way Dante's accusers tried to destroy him by getting him to come back to Florence and stand trial, and then tried to destroy his good name. Certainly these two cantos are grimly humorous, and they suggest Dante's contempt for those who go in for subsurface dealings. Also, if Virgil on one level stands for Dante's conscience, then it makes sense that Virgil would have been convinced that Dante was in no danger-after all, he was innocent-but a clear conscience isn't always enough. Sometimes one has to run.

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 23,"Summary
	At first Dante and Virgil go on quietly, presumably hoping to get to the bridge over the next bolgia (the sixth) that the chief devil had told them was unbroken. But then Dante starts thinking about how the devils are going to be feeling after being fooled and humiliated, and suggests they hide. Virgil has already seen what he's thinking and totally agrees, but before they can do anything, they see the devils flying after them. Then, as a mother wakes up to see flames threatening and picks up her child and runs, not waiting to put on any clothes, so Virgil picks up Dante and slides down the bank into the next bolgia. There they are safe, since no devil can leave the bolgia to which it has been assigned. In this ditch they find people walking around the circle very slowly, wearing cloaks and hoods of the kinds monks wear. These garments are gilded and bright on the outside, but made of lead and unbearably heavy. ""O weary mantle for eternity!"" (line 68). The sinners Dante talks to tell him that all these souls were hypocrites; they themselves had been appointed joint rulers of Florence to bring about peace, but had actually been corrupt and caused destruction. Stretched across the path of the hypocrites (so that each must walk on him) and crucified with three stakes is Caiaphas, the high priest who contributed to the crucifixion of Christ by arguing that it was expedient for one man to be executed for the sake of the people.
	Virgil asks if there is any place where it's easy to climb out of the ditch, and is told that the next bridge is broken in such a way that they can climb up on its ruins. That is the bridge that the chief of the devils had said they could cross by, and Virgil is so upset at finding out he's been lied to he moves ahead quickly, and Dante follows, in the track of ""the print of the dear feet"" (line 148).
	Analysis
	Virgil is usually so dignified, but here he puts all his dignity aside to save Dante. Some see here how completely Dante had to commit himself to his conscience to escape the charge against him; others emphasize that this touch that brings out Virgil's full humanity. The human beings in Dante's work may stand for something more than themselves, but part of what makes the Inferno a great poem is the full human relationship between Dante and Virgil, so different from the ""relationships"" between the souls they meet.
	If you have ever deliberately tried to appear to be something you weren't for a prolonged period of time in order to get what you wanted, you may have some idea how perfectly this punishment reveals not only the essence of the sin, but at least one aspect of the price one pays for it. What a burden!

Summary
	Dante is deeply discouraged by seeing Virgil so upset, but Virgil recovers as soon as they reach the place where they have to climb, and turns to Dante ""with that sweet look that I first saw at the foot of the mountain"" (lines 20-21), back in the Dark Wood. Once again he picks Dante up and lifts him high enough that he can climb on his own, with Virgil's help. It's the hardest climb they've had yet, and Dante sits down exhausted at the top, but Virgil urges him on. Sloth won't win him fame. And Dante pulls himself together and goes on.
	They go over the next high, narrow bridge, but can only see the souls down in the ditch (the Seventh Bolgia) when they come to the other side. There they see shades tormented by serpents. As they watch, one soul is bitten by a serpent, dissolves into ash, and then re-forms. It turns out to be a notorious plunderer and thief named Vanni Fucci, who is so ashamed to have Dante see him here that he foretells the coming victory of the Blacks in Florence, just to wound Dante.
	When he has finished speaking, the thief lifts up both his hands in the obscene gesture called the fig (the fingers in a fist, the thumb thrust through between the index and second finger), defying God. Two serpents choke him and bind his hands, and he goes off. A centaur named Cacus, known for his thievery, pursues him. Three more spirits come in sight, and Dante and Virgil watch as they change shapes with each other, one becoming a serpent.
	Analysis
	Subtle thieves, who operate by deception, are worse in Dante's scheme of things that open robbers, and they are aptly tormented by creeping serpents. As they did not allow others to call their property their own, so now they cannot call their bodies their own.
	The absurdity of the pride that resists and defies God, who is Reality itself, becomes more and more obvious. Farinata one can see as noble; Capaneus is, as Virgil points out, torturing himself with his defiance; and what could be more ludicrous than making an obscene gesture at God?

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 26,"Canto 26
Summary
	Dante the narrator begins the canto by making a little speech to Florence, telling her to rejoice, since no less than five of the thieves he has just met are prominent Florentines. But great disaster is coming toward her, and he hopes it will come soon, since it must come, because it will only bring him more pain later.
	Dante and Virgil move on, Virgil helping Dante with the hard ascent of the next bridge. Remembering what he saw then (in the Eighth Bolgia), Dante the narrator says he still grieves over it, and feels fresh resolve not to misuse the powers he has been given. What Dante see are tongues of flame, as many as fireflies on a summer night, and Virgil tells him that within each is a tormented spirit, and within one flame whose top is split are two spirits, Ulysses (Odysseus) and Diomedes, who advised the Greeks to deceive the Trojans with the Trojan Horse. At Dante's urgent request, Virgil conjures Ulysses to speak and tell where he went on his last voyage and how he died. Ulysses tells how, hungry always for new experience, he did not go back to his wife and son and kingdom after he left Circe but on to the Pillars of Hercules. There he persuaded his men to sail on into the open Atlantic, telling them ""You were not born to live like beasts, but to follow virtue and knowledge"" (lines 119-120), and to have as full an experience of the world as possible before your brief life ends. Ulysses goes on to tell how they sailed on their crazy journey for many days, until finally they saw a mountain rising out of the sea. From that mountain a storm rose and sank their ship.
	Analysis
	In the Eighth Bolgia are those who used their high gifts of intelligence and eloquence to persuade other to commit fraud, stealing their integrity as here the flame steals the form of the sinner. Ulysses was not nearly as much of a hero in medieval versions of the story of Troy as he was in Homer, whom Dante could not read, knowing no Greek. Nevertheless, many have felt that he is presented as truly heroic here, in a version of his story that is Dante's original creation. Certainly the speech Ulysses makes is one of the best-known passages of the poem. Those who see Ulysses as heroic believe that Dante sympathized with his aspiration for full experience and knowledge, even though, given the theology of Dante's day, Ulysses had to be condemned. Others have argued that, splendid as the rhetoric of the speech may be, Ulysses himself calls his journey crazy, and to make it he has to turn his back on all his human ties.

Summary
	Recognizing him as Italian, a soul, by moving the tip of its tongue of flame asks Dante to tell him the state of things in Romagna, from which he comes. Dante tells him of endless warfare between the nobles there, and begs to know his name. The soul answers, ""If I believed my answer were to someone who would ever return to the world, this flame would remain still. But since never from this depth has anyone returned alive, if I hear true, without fear of infamy I answer you"" (lines 61-66). Still, he does not say his name (Guido da Montefeltro), but simply tells his story. While he was young, he played the fox, and was famous for his knowledge of all the tricks and deceptions that are effective in the world. As he got older, he repented and became a Franciscan friar, and that would have meant his salvation, if Pope Boniface VIII hadn't sent for him to ask his advice on how to get the best of an Italian family he was feuding with. When Guido didn't answer, Boniface absolved him ahead of time for any sin, boasting of his power as pope to control who would get into Heaven. Guido advised him to promise and then break his promise. When Guido died, St. Francis came for him, but a devil got in first and claimed him, pointing out that absolution does no good without repentance first, and it's obvious one hasn't repented if one goes ahead and does the deed.
	Analysis
	The passage quoted above was used by T.S. Eliot as the epigraph for The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock. It illustrates here how deep the infamy of these souls is. ""Politics as usual"" was no excuse in Dante's eyes for this misuse of human intelligence. The advice Guido da Montefeltro gave was that the pope should promise to spare the city he was fighting if they surrendered, and then should go ahead and destroy the city. Boniface did just that.

Summary
	In the Ninth Bolgia, Dante is horrified to see more blood and wounds than were ever created by the worst slaughter of ancient or recent times. The first of the souls who suffer there is Mahomet (Mohammed), whose whole body is sliced almost in two; he explains that all the souls here in their lives created divisions, and so here they are wounded by a devil. The wounds have closed by the time they get around the circle again, and the devil wounds them again. Two of the souls he speaks to here tells of someone living who will soon be here. One with his hands cut off confesses himself to be the man who urged on the murder that started the feuding of Guelph and Ghibelline in Florence. Finally, most unbelievable horror, the poet who encouraged a young prince to rebel against his father walks carrying his own head like a lantern. He holds his head up to speak to them, confessing his deed and the appropriateness of his suffering.
	Analysis
	Mohammed was believed by medieval Christians to have been Christian himself and then to have turned against the Church, leading to all the warfare of the Muslim conquest of North Africa and Spain, and then of the Crusades, just ending in complete defeat for the Christian side in Dante's day. These are the sowers of discord where there should have been harmony and unity; they have used their (often great) gifts of intelligence and persuasion in a way that has disrupted the natural (and therefore divine) order of things and led to endless wounds and blood.

Summary
	Dante is so overwhelmed by the evil here that he just wants to stay and weep, but Virgil urges him on-they must finish their journey through Hell this day. Dante explains that he is lingering because he thinks he sees one of his kinsmen, but Virgil urges him to forget the man-he is here, and he is here justly, and he feels only anger at Dante (who explains that his kinsman is angry because his murder has not been avenged). Dante and Virgil go on to the Tenth (and last) Bolgia, which is full of people suffering from loathsome diseases such as leprosy and of the smell of rotting flesh. Here the counterfeiters, or falsifiers, of every kind suffer. Dante speaks to two Italians who were alchemists; they confess their systematic deception of those who believed they could turn other metals into gold because they knew so well how to counterfeit gold.
	Analysis
	For Dante to linger here would be to risk becoming part of the problem, if he accepted the hideous custom that created so much strife in Italy of private vengeance and endless feud. Think of the Montagues and the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet. On a more universal level, to linger over evil and be devastated by it serves no purpose. As Virgil always urges Dante, see each sin for what it is and move on!
	In the Tenth Bolgia is an image of a completely sick society, where people who think only of gain create imitations of reality in order to deceive, rather than creating anything real. One commentator has wondered what Dante would have thought of the advertising business.

Summary
	Still in the Tenth Bolgia, Dante sees two shades running among the others and biting them cruelly. One in Dante's own day impersonated a dead man and made a will favorable to the man's son, and himself. The other, according to the story in Ovid, was overwhelmed by a passion for her own father, and impersonated another woman in order to sleep with him. The only person Dante speaks to here is Master Adam, who lies helpless and swollen with dropsy, yearning for just one drop of water-but yearning even more to torment those who persuaded him to take up counterfeiting the currency of Florence. Master Adam tells Dante the names of those who lie silently burning in fever near him, and one of them strikes him. Master Adam strikes back, and each one taunts the other with his crimes, while Dante listens, fascinated. Then Virgil reproaches him, and he is filled with such shame that Virgil instantly forgives him, urging him to remember that Virgil is with him if he should ever again be tempted to listen, fascinated, to such quarreling.
	Analysis
	One canto is not enough to portray this sickness, which completes the picture of the moral destruction of an individual or a society guilty of the kind of fraud that violates the bond of love that naturally unites all human beings. With this canto, the Eighth Circle ends. Here Dante the narrator portrays those who have betrayed the trust of others by falsifying and finding their only satisfaction in attacking each other. Here again Dante lingers, but this time Virgil is angry. To take delight in hearing people attack each other is very close to joining in the attack oneself. One can see from this canto why some commentators speak of Virgil as symbolizing Dante's conscience.

Summary
	Healed by Virgil's forgiveness, Dante moves on with him, moving up the bank out of the Tenth Bolgia and on into the darkness. Dante can see little, but he hears the blast of a horn and, looking toward its source, thinks he sees towers. Virgil warns him that these shapes are not towers but giants, each standing around the edge of the deepest pit of Hell, but so huge that they tower up out of the pit. As Dante sees them more clearly, he is filled with fear, but in fact they are no threat to him. The first is Nimrod, who (according to the Book of Genesis) built the Tower of Babel in a proud and defiant attempt to reach Heaven and so caused the one language human beings had spoken up to that time to be lost. He can only babble meaninglessly. Next comes one of the giants who tried to unseat Jove, and he is bound. Finally they come to Antaeus, an old antagonist of Hercules, who can speak and is not bound, and he is easily flattered into setting them down at the bottom of the pit. Virgil holds Dante fast, but Dante is still pretty terrified when he sees Antaeus bend his vast shape toward them-Dante would have preferred another road. But Antaeus sets them down safely.
	Analysis
	This canto is almost comic relief, after the ugliness of the ten bolgias of Malebolge, the Eighth Circle. Yet the likeness of the giants to towers was perhaps meant to suggest the towers from which so many aristocrats afflicted the countryside in Italy, towers that were to Dante emblems of humanity destroyed by pride and violence and brute force ruling. Certainly they could be seen as symbols of the forces that run the world when the bond of love that by nature should rule in human hearts is destroyed.

Summary
	Dante has no rhymes harsh and grating enough to speak of the bottom of the universe, the place where the two poets find themselves now. It is a completely frozen lake, and as they cross it they see the heads of those most famous for betraying their kin. They are frozen in the ice forever, and their only desire is to make others suffer. This first part of the frozen lake is called Caina, after Cain, who slew his brother. Shivering in the eternal cold, they move on into the second part, Antenora, named for the Trojan believed in the Middle Ages to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks. In the darkness, Dante accidentally kicks the face of one of the sinners, and when the man refuses to tell his name, Dante seizes him by the hair and pulls out clumps, until someone nearby says the man's name, and Dante has his suspicion confirmed that this is the man who betrayed the Guelphs at a great battle. Next Dante sees two souls packed in one hole. One of them is gnawing the other's head. Dante asks to hear their story, promising to make the deed for which the gnawer seeks revenge known in the world above.
	Having ""lifted his mouth from his savage meal"" (line 1), the sinner consents to relive the horror of what happened by telling it, for the sake of revenge. He was Count Ugolino, and his victim is Archbishop Ruggieri. Ugolino trusted Ruggieri, and, together with his sons, was captured by him. That part of the story Ugolino doesn't need to dwell on. It had happened recently, and Dante and his audience knew it well. But exactly how he died he will tell. He and his sons were shut in a tower, and one morning after an ominous dream they heard, at the time when food had usually been brought to them, the door of the tower being nailed up. He couldn't weep, but his children did. After two days, he bit his hands for grief, and the youngest son, ""my little Anselm"" (line 50), thinking he was biting his hands for hunger, urged him to eat them. He kept himself calm after that, so as not to add to their grief, and all stayed silent for two more days. Then the first son, asking his father why he couldn't help him, died, and so, one by one, did the others. He, now blind, for two days called their names. ""Then, more than sorrow, hunger had power"" (line 75). Having told his story, Ugolino goes back to gnawing his enemy's skull. Dante the narrator, having recorded the story, bursts forth in reproaches on Pisa, the city that allowed Rugierri to punish innocent children so cruelly.
	The poets move on to the region where those who betray guests lie with faces turned up. Because the tears they weep form pools and freeze over their eyes, they become unable to either weep or see. Dante's face is so numb he can hardly feel, but he does feel a wind, and asks what can possibly be causing it, down here where there are no variations of heat and cold. Virgil replies that he will soon see the cause.
	One of the traitors in this area asks Dante to remove the ice from his eyes, so that he can give some vent to his misery. Dante replies that the sinner must tell Dante his name, and then may Dante have to go to the bottom of the ice if he doesn't help him. Dante is surprised to hear someone named he had thought was still alive, a friar named Alberigo, who had invited his brother and the brother's son to a feast and then murdered them. Alberigo tells him that this area, called Ptolomea (from a Ptolemy who invited his father-in-law to a banquet and then murdered him), has the unique privilege of receiving souls whose bodies are still alive. Such a soul, as soon as it has committed its treachery, falls straight into the ice, and a devil takes its place in the living body.
	Having answered all Dante's questions, Alberigo asks to have his eyes opened. Dante does not keep his promise, ""and it was courtesy to be rude to him"" (line 150).
	Analysis
	No one before Dante had given such a detailed description of Hell, so full of meaning; perhaps his most brilliant stroke was to make the bottom of Hell ice instead of fire. In many ways all along he has been telling us that choosing to try to be happy by going against the divine order of the universe and hurting oneself and others actually means moving away from life and love, from everything that really makes us happy. Ice is a perfect symbol for the hardening that comes with the complete rejection of life and love seen when people betray those they are most closely bound to, whether by the ties of kinship and country, into which they are born, or by offering them hospitality. Guests are seen as sacred in every traditional society. And how horrible to think that treachery as deep as that to a guest could even have such a profound effect on the soul that one would no longer be able to repent. All the sinners seen up till now could, according to the teaching of the Church accepted by Dante, have repented and turned to God, even at the last second of their lives, and no matter how horrible their sins, they would have been forgiven. They would have had some work to do in Purgatory to get rid of the effects of their sins on their souls, but in the end they would have entered Heaven. But here Dante suggests that it is possible to lose the ability to repent. Whether we accept Dante's theology or not, perhaps we can think of people so lost in egotism and hate, so unable to feel for anyone else, that they seem utterly frozen and cut off from ordinary human life.
	The two instances of Dante's cruelty to sinners in these two cantos has led once again to the question of whether he is being shown as affected by the sins he condemns. In this case, has he been frozen by the winds of Hell and lost the ability to pity these souls so completely that he even adds to their suffering? And again, the answer that has been given is that those who have rejected life and love cannot in any meaningful way be treated kindly-from Dante, as from the universe, they get what they have chosen.
	Certainly the story of Ugolino shows how deep was Dante's pity for the suffering of the innocent. It is the longest story in the Inferno, and it is the saddest, whether one interprets its last line, ""Then, more than sorrow, hunger had power"" (line 75), as meaning that Ugolino died too or that he ate the bodies of his children. Dante tells the story in a way that seems to be deliberately meant to make us remember the story of Paolo and Francesca in Canto 5, and it is fascinating to see the similarities and differences between the two stories. Just to take the most striking contrast, instead of the ""love"" that unites Paolo and Francesca, here Ugolino and Ruggiero are united by hatred, so closely that the one gnaws on the other.

Summary
	Now in the deepest depth of Hell, the lowest point in the whole universe, Virgil announces to Dante that he is about to see the being who is the king of Hell. Dante looks through the gloom and sees something that looks like a huge windmill in the distance. Certainly the wind is strong, and he has to shelter himself behind Virgil. In the icy plain beneath them the souls are now completely buried in the ice, through which he sees them. When they get closer, Virgil makes Dante come out from behind him and stop and look at Satan. Dante is so frozen and weak he feels neither dead nor alive, but he looks. There stands the being who was once the fairest angel in Heaven, Lucifer, who rebelled against the Creator who had made him so fair. Utterly ugly now, he is as much bigger than the giants Dante saw at the outer edge of the deepest pits as those giants were bigger than Dante. His head has three faces, one red, one white and yellow, one black. Two great bat wings sprout under each face, and it is the flapping of those wings that freezes the ice of Cocytus. He weeps tears and blood from each of his six eyes, and in each mouth he chews on a sinner. Virgil explains that the one suffering most is Judas Iscariot, and the other two are Brutus and Cassius. Now, having seen everything, they must go.
	Dante holds tight to Virgil, with his arms around Virgil's neck, and Virgil goes right up to Satan and takes hold of his flanks, which are covered with tufts of hair. From tuft to tuft he descends to the midpoint of Satan's body, and then manages to turn himself upside down and start climbing. They reach a cleft in the rock and there Virgil puts Dante down on the edge. Dante looks back, and there are Lucifer's legs upside down. Dante is utterly bewildered. Virgil explains that the midpoint of Satan's body is the center of gravity of the earth, and so at that point Virgil had to turn himself around and start climbing. Now they have a long climb to make through a hollow in the rock made by a river. It takes them a whole day; in the end, Dante says, ""We came out from there to see again the stars"" (line 139).
	Analysis
	No one else has ever shown Satan like this-not full of energy and wit and power, but trapped forever in the negation of life that results from turning against the source of life. Every detail of the description is full of meaning. The hardest part for a modern reader is the suffering of Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar. Influenced by Shakespeare and by modern democratic ideals, we tend to see at least Brutus as a hero, but Dante saw him, not only as a man who treacherously turned on his friend and leader instead of opposing him openly, but as having betrayed, in Caesar, the man who was in effect the first ruler of the Roman Empire, which Dante believed was ordained by God to bring peace to the earth.
	The way Dante and Virgil get out of Hell has a much more universal meaning, one that seems brilliant, even to those who share none of Dante's beliefs. In a way it sums up the whole of the poem. The only sure way out of Hell is by seeing Hell for what it is. To escape from the negation of life represented by Satan, we must use Satan. And once we have finally and completely gotten over the idea that there is anything appealing about the kind of turning against life and love that Satan embodies, we also see how powerless, meaningless, even absurd that rejection is. The last view of Satan is of two hairy legs upside down in the darkness.
	The last line of the Inferno, ""We came out from there to see again the stars,"" beautiful as it is in itself, after the dark stench and paralysis of Hell, is even more full of meaning for Dante than it can be for us. The earth is the center of Dante's universe, and that means that it is the lowest point. Only here does sin have any power. Beyond the circle that the moon makes around the earth, all is order and beauty, and the stars are obviously and always moving in an ordered dance. The Purgatorio ends with the line, ""Pure and prepared to leap up to the stars,"" and the Paradiso ends with the will of the pilgrim Dante completely one with ""The love that moves the sun and the other stars.""

Summary
	The play opens in a room at the court of King Henry VIII, in London. The Duke of Norfolk meets the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Abergavenny. Buckingham asks Norfolk how he has been since they last met in France. Norfolk replies that he is well, and still admires what he saw there. They had accompanied the king to a great display of wealth and military prowess by England and France, which took place in a field in France. Norfolk describes the impressive scene to Buckingham, who had missed everything through illness.
	Buckingham asks who organized the event, and Norfolk says it was Cardinal Wolsey, the king's chief advisor. Buckingham voices his contempt and dislike for Wolsey as an ambitious, meddling self-seeker, and condemns the event in France as ""vanities."" Norfolk is more conciliatory, pointing out that Wolsey lacks the example lent by noble ancestors and experienced assistants; he is a self-made man and has only his own resources to rely on.
	Abergavenny joins in with Buckingham's condemnation of Wolsey, criticising his pride, which he says is ""from hell."" Buckingham adds that Wolsey did not seek the king's permission when deciding who should go to France. Wolsey made the nobles pay for the event, yet he gave least honor to those who paid most. Abergavenny confirms that several of his relatives funded the event by selling part of their estates, which would never recover. Buckingham says the event resulted only in a massive waste of money and empty talk. Norfolk agrees that the peace between England and France does not justify such a cost. In any case, France has broken the agreement by seizing British merchants' goods at Bordeaux. But he warns Buckingham to be careful, since Wolsey is a powerful and vengeful man.
	They are interrupted by the arrival of Wolsey with his guards and secretaries. Wolsey and Buckingham glare at each other. Wolsey asks a secretary if Buckingham's former Surveyor (estate overseer), who has come to give evidence against him, has arrived. The secretary says he has, and Wolsey leaves with his party.
	Buckingham fears that Wolsey is plotting against him. He thinks he is on his way to the king to stir up trouble for him, and decides to follow him. But Norfolk warns Buckingham against this, advising him to calm down and show restraint. Buckingham takes his advice, though he says he has proof that Wolsey is corrupt and treasonous. Norfolk is shocked by the accusation of treason, but Buckingham insists that he will say as much to the king, and provide proof. Buckingham enumerates Wolsey's faults: he is greedy, cunning, and given to mischief; he organized the French event simply to show off his high status in France as well as England; and he drew up the France-England treaty that was agreed there to suit his own ends. He also deals with Queen Katherine's nephew, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, behind King Henry's back. Charles had been worried at the prospect of England forming an alliance with France, as it would threaten Spain's interests. Wolsey, says Buckingham, buys and sells the king's honor for his own advantage.
	At that moment, Brandon, the sergeant-at-arms, comes in with the Guard, and arrests Buckingham in the name of the king, on the charge of high treason. Buckingham is certain that Wolsey has arranged this. He says goodbye to Abergavenny, but Brandon says he has come to arrest him too, along with others among their friends. Buckingham says that Wolsey must have bribed the Surveyor to incriminate him. As the prisoners are taken to be locked up in the Tower of London, Buckingham believes his life is over.
	Analysis
	The Prologue sets the scene for the play, making clear that its purpose is to present historical truth and arouse pity for those powerful people who have fallen. The play covers some years of the reign of King Henry VIII up to the birth of his daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth I, by his second wife, Anne Boleyn.
	The first scene establishes the character of Wolsey as seen from the point of view of his enemy, Buckingham. We do not yet know how objectively true Buckingham's opinion is. Certain aspects of his tirade against Wolsey betray the prejudice of the noble (Buckingham) for the self-made humbly born man (Wolsey). Wolsey was reported to be the son of a butcher, so Buckingham calls him a ""butcher's cur"" (line 120) and invokes the traditional distinction of rank to ""cry down"" ""This Ipswich fellow's insolence"" (lines 137-8). His attitude reflects the widespread alarm among the nobility in Tudor times at the rise of a wealthy merchant middle-class and a more flexible class and education system that allowed low-class men like Wolsey to attain high office.
	However, Buckingham's accusations of ruthlessness and cunning are backed up by Wolsey's hostile attitude to him during his brief appearance, along with the arrrest of Buckingham at the end of the scene. It is significant too that at his arrest, Buckingham is accused of exactly the same crime of which he had previously accused Wolsey. The impression given is that Wolsey has both spied upon and plotted against Buckingham. Also striking is the fact that Buckingham claims he has proof of Wolsey's treason, yet Wolsey has as yet presented no evidence of Buckingham's treason - but Wolsey is nevertheless able to have Buckingham arrested for treason. This shows that the power lies with Wolsey, not with the likes of Buckingham and those nobly born friends of his who are also arrested.
	The Prologue had warned that the play would show us ""How soon this mightiness meets misery,"" or the fall of powerful people. Buckingham is the first to fall, through the intervention of Wolsey.
	The display of military achievement by the royal courts of France and England referred to in this scene is known to historians as the Field of the Cloth of Gold, after the rich materials of the tents set up to accommodate the royals and nobles who attended. The event took place in 1520 against the background of a triangular power struggle in Europe between the great powers of the time - France (ruled by King Francis I), Spain (ruled by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, also the nephew of King Henry VIII's wife Katherine), and the newcomer, England. France and Spain vied with each other for an alliance with England to swing the balance of power in their favor. Wolsey favored an allliance with France, but Katherine favored an alliance with her home country of Spain. The Field of the Cloth of Gold, where King Henry VIII of England and King Francis I of France agreed in principle to an alliance, appeared to be a victory for Wolsey, but it was somewhat tainted and short-lived. The event severely strained the finances of both countries and the results were negligible. Shortly after, Henry met Charles V in England and signed a treaty with the Empire. Over the next few years, treaties between the three countries were signed and broken with wearisome regularity, with the result that no one power gained ascendancy.

Summary
	The king, leaning on Wolsey's shoulder, thanks him for foiling Buckingham's treasonous plot. He asks for Buckingham's Surveyor, who had testified against his master, to be brought before him so that he can hear his evidence.
	Queen Katherine enters, with the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and kneels before the king. The king greets her and bids her rise, but she insists on remaining on her knees, since she is going to make a request of him. She explains that she has been asked to intercede with the king by his subjects, who are upset at the levying of new taxes. The people especially blame Wolsey, who originated the taxes, but their anger is also directed at the king, who is ultimately responsible. She fears that rebellion will break out. Norfolk backs up her argument, saying that employers have had to lay off their employees in order to pay the taxes, creating a desperate class of unemployed and starving people.
	The king says he is unaware of the new tax. Katherine explains that each subject is being asked to pay one sixth of his worth to pay for the king's wars in France, and that this is turning formerly loyal subjects hostile. The king says he is unhappy about the tax. Wolsey protests that the tax was levied unanimously by the entire king's Council and approved by the judges; his was only ""a single voice"" in the decision. He says that we should not refrain from doing necessary actions out of fear of malicious critics. He adds that our best actions are often the most criticised, and our worst, the most praised. The king replies that things that are carefully thought out do not create fear in the people. Believing that the tax is far too harsh, he tells Wolsey to revoke it and send letters to each county issuing a free pardon for any man who has refused to pay. Wolsey passes this order on to his secretary, but tells him to start a rumor that it is at Wolsey's request that the king revoked the tax.
	Buckingham's former Surveyor comes in. Katherine tells the king that she regrets that he is displeased with Buckingham. The king praises Buckingham's noble qualities, but says that he has become corrupted. He asks the Surveyor to repeat his evidence so that Katherine can hear it. The Surveyor says that Buckingham told his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny, that if the king died without a male heir, he himself would claim the throne. A friar, Nicholas Henton, had encouraged Buckingham to believe that he could be king.
	Katherine points out that Buckingham had fired the Surveyor when his tenants complained about him. She warns that the Surveyor could be giving false evidence to gain revenge on his former master. But the king asks the Surveyor to continue. The Surveyor vows that he is telling the truth. He goes on to say that Buckingham had said that if the king died, he (Buckingham) would have Wolsey and Sir Thomas Lovell executed in order to clear his path to the throne. The Surveyor also claims that Buckingham had told a story about his father, who had planned to kill Richard III to prevent him from usurping the throne, but had been foiled when he could not gain admittance to Richard. Buckingham, the Surveyor says, had vowed to outdo his father and kill King Henry VIII. The king is convinced that Buckingham is a traitor and orders that he be brought to trial immediately.
	Analysis
	By far the wisest character in this scene (arguably, in the whole play) is Queen Katherine. She has the ability to look beyond the surface of things and see their root causes. She warns the king of imminent rebellion if he does not repeal Wolsey's new tax. She also warns the king of the unreliability of the Surveyor's evidence against Buckingham, on the grounds that he might be motivated by a grudge against his former master, who had fired him.
	The king, while motivated by integrity and generosity, lacks his wife's insight. Though he takes Katherine's advice regarding the tax and repeals it, by his inattention, he allows Wolsey, who originated the tax, to continue to operate in pursuit of his own ends. This confirms Buckingham's charge in the previous scene that Wolsey has taken on some of the king's authority. The king also shows poor judgement in failing to listen to Katherine when she warns that the Surveyor may not be an impartial witness. Naively, he is more ready to trust Wolsey in his view of Buckingham as a traitor.
	The Surveyor's reference to Richard III refers to Shakespeare's play of that name. The play tells how Buckingham's father, also called the Duke of Buckingham, supported Richard in his struggle to be crowned king. He helped Richard get rid of those family members who stood between him and the throne. Eventually, Buckingham Senior had begun to doubt Richard and refused to carry out his order to murder two young princes who preceded Richard in line to the throne. When Richard became king, Buckingham Senior asked for the reward of land that Richard had promised him. Richard, however, suspected that he could no longer rely on Buckingham Senior's loyalty, and had him executed. In Henry VIII, the Surveyor says that Buckingham Junior was planning to go further than his father, and to kill King Henry.

Summary
	The Lord Chamberlain and Lord Sands are making fun of the odd fashions that have been brought back to the English court by nobles who went to France. Sir Thomas Lovell enters with the news that a proclamation has been issued at the court urging people to abandon the French fashions. The three men agree that this is a good idea.
	Lovell says that he is going to Wolsey's house for a lavish supper, and that the Lord Chamberlain and Sands are also invited. They agree that Wolsey is generous, and set out for Wolsey's house, St James's Palace.
	At St James's Palace, Sir Henry Guilford greets the guests on behalf of Wolsey. Among the guests is Anne Bullen (Boleyn), who will become King Henry's second wife. Sands flirts with Anne.
	Wolsey enters and sits on the chair of state. A group of strangers is shown in by a Servant. Their faces are covered with masks and they are pretending to be foreign shepherds, seemingly from France. In reality, this is the king and some of his courtiers in disguise. The strangers greet Wolsey. The Lord Chamberlain explains to him that they speak no English, but that they have heard impressive tales of Wolsey's party and could not fail to attend. Wolsey welcomes them.
	The disguised king meets Anne and is struck by her beauty. He dances with Anne, and the rest of his party dance with other ladies. After the dance ends, Wolsey asks the Lord Chamberlain to tell the strangers that there is one among them who is more worthy of his chair of state than he is himself. If that person would make himself known, he would surrender it to him. The Lord Chamberlain conveys this suggestion to the strangers and they reply, saying that there is such a person, and that Wolsey must guess which is he. Wolsey correctly identifies the king, who takes off his mask.
	The king compliments Wolsey on the large number of beautiful women present, warning that if he were not a churchman (and therefore, in theory, above reproach), he would judge him unfavorably. The king asks Wolsey the identity of the beautiful woman he just met, and Wolsey replies that it was Anne Bullen, daughter of Sir Thomas Bullen and lady-in-waiting to Queen Katherine. The king tells Anne that it was bad manners on his part to dance with her and not kiss her, which he does now. He is reluctant to part with her and orders the music to strike up for another dance.
	Analysis
	These scenes have two main functions, serving to show the almost royal status that Wolsey has built up for himself, and to introduce King Henry to his future wife and the future mother of Queen Elizabeth I, Anne Bullen.
	The two themes inter-relate because we later find out that Wolsey is scheming for Henry to marry the sister of the French king, in order to cement the alliance agreed at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. Thus, Wolsey does not support the marriage between Henry and Anne. In terms of the grand purpose of this play, which is to celebrate the birth of Queen Elizabeth I, Wolsey is on the 'wrong' side and so is doomed to fall. This is reinforced by the lengthy gibe at outlandish French fashions at the beginning of scene 3. Queen Elizabeth I always boasted that (unlike her half-sister, Mary I, the daughter of the Spanish Queen Katherine) she was thoroughly English-bred. Here, Shakespeare has the nobles put forward an anti-French and nationalistic point of view. However, it cannot be assumed that this was Shakespeare's own view, since most of his plays show a truly cosmopolitan fascination with the fashions, culture, geography and mores of continental Europe. Even in this scene from Henry VIII, the nobles' mockery of French fashions is good-natured and displays a detailed interest in, and knowledge of, the subject.
	It is implicit in these scenes that Wolsey, a churchman, has over-reached himself in status and has become unfittingly worldly. Churchmen (especially after Henry VIII made himself head of the Church of England, independent of the Catholic Church and the Pope, in 1535) were expected to be humble, abstemious and plain-living people, known for their wisdom and holiness. Shakespeare's Wolsey, on the other hand, is known primarily for throwing lavish parties with rich food, drink, dancing and beautiful women. Like the king, Wolsey lives in a palace, and also like the king (in Act 1, scene 2), he sits on a throne of state. The fact that we have already seen the king sitting on his throne, and now we have seen Wolsey sitting in his, plants a suggestion in our minds that Wolsey aspires to royal status. In a low-born ""butcher's cur,"" people of Shakespeare's time would have seen such raw ambition as a violation of the laws of nature - kings were determined by ancient royal bloodlines and appointed by God himself - as well as potentially treasonous. Significantly, at his party, Wolsey is careful to surrender his own chair of state to the king, but there is a foreshadowing of danger in the possibility that Wolsey will not recognise the disguised king.
	Shakespeare introduces subtle pointers to the inherent wrongness of the spiritual leader of a nation becoming famous for his worldly qualities and trappings. In Act 1, scene 3, line 60, Sands, talking of Wolsey's great wealth, notes that if he were mean with his hospitality, this would be ""a worse sin than ill doctrine."" The sin of a man of the church would indeed be ""ill doctrine"" - incorrect theological beliefs - but Wolsey has crossed over into being a rich man of the world, in which case the only sin he could be guilty of is meanness. In scene 4, Sands' suggestive banter about the attractive women present would suit the worldly atmosphere of the court, but would be inappropriate in the house of a deeply spiritual churchman - which Wolsey clearly is not. Wolsey's invitation to his guests to ""take their pleasures"" would almost fit in the mouth of a brothel-keeper.
	The most overt condemnation of Wolsey's lifestyle is the king's barbed comment, ""You are a churchman, or I'll tell you cardinal, / I should judge now most unhappily."" The genial surface meaning of the king's comment is that Wolsey's status as a churchman means that he is above reproach, even while he holds a party stuffed with beautiful women. The more threatening underlying meaning, of which the king may or may not be aware, is that Wolsey is not a true man of the church and deserves to be judged unfavorably for betraying his sacred office.

Summary
	Two Gentlemen meet in the street. The Second Gentleman is on his way to see the trial of the Duke of Buckingham. The First Gentleman says that he is too late: it is over. Buckingham pleaded not guilty and spoke eloquently in his defense, but he was found guilty of treason. Those who testified against him included his Surveyor; Sir Gilbert Perk, his chancellor (secretary); John Car, his confessor; and the friar, Nicholas Hopkins (earlier in the play called Henton), who encouraged Buckingham to believe he should be king.
	The Second Gentleman says that Wolsey is responsible for all this. Wolsey has also been sending nobles favored by the king to distant parts. The Second Gentleman says that the people's representatives in Parliament (""the commons"") hate Wolsey, and ""wish him ten faddom deep,"" that is, at the bottom of the sea. On the other hand, they adore Buckingham.
	They are interrupted by the entrance of Buckingham, surrounded by an armed guard and accompanied by Lovell, Vaux, Sands, and common people. Buckingham makes a speech, in which he swears his loyalty to the king and says he does not criticise the law, but ""those that sought it I could wish more Christians"" - a reference to Wolsey. He forgives them, but warns them not to indulge in mischief or use the deaths of more noblemen for their own ends. Lovell asks Buckingham to forgive him, which he does. Buckingham invokes blessings on the king and says he will pray for his long life.
	Vaux wants to make the barge that is to carry Buckingham to his execution fit for a Duke, but Buckingham refuses, saying that his high status is now meaningless. He criticises his ""base accusers,"" who ""never knew what truth meant."" He speaks of his father, who had loyally served Richard III but was betrayed by him. Richard had been succeeded by King Henry VII, who had restored the Buckingham family honors. But now Henry VII's son, Henry VIII, had taken everything from him once again. Buckingham counsels those present to be careful with their friendship and asks them to pray for him. Then he is led away.
	The two Gentlemen comment that if Buckingham is innocent, his accusers will suffer ""curses on their heads."" The Second Gentleman says that evil greater than this is already on the horizon. He has heard a rumor that the king plans to separate from Katherine. He says that Wolsey, out of malice to Katherine, has introduced doubts into the king's mind that threaten to ruin her. Cardinal Campeius, an envoy from the Pope, has arrived to discuss the matter.
	The First Gentleman says that Wolsey is doing this to avenge himself on the Holy Roman Emperor and Katherine's nephew, Charles V, for refusing to make him archbishop of Toledo. The two Gentlemen express sympathy for Katherine and leave to talk in private.
	Analysis
	It is not clear whether Buckingham is genuinely guilty of treason, but the trumped-up nature of his trial is evident from the dubious integrity of most of the witnesses against him. The Surveyor is his former employee, whom he fired and who therefore holds a grudge against him; Car, his confessor, is breaking the sacred trust of the confessional in testifying; and the friar, Hopkins/Henton, fed Buckingham with prophecies that he would be king and must therefore share in his guilt. Because Hopkins/Henton is guilty of inciting treason, he will probably have bought his freedom in exchange for testifying against Buckingham, or perhaps he was tortured into giving evidence. Either way, Hopkins/Henton's testimony is suspect.
	While Buckingham refuses to name names, his comment that he ""could wish more Christians"" those who sought his downfall is a severe indictment of Wolsey, who occupies the position of highest spiritual authority in the land. Buckingham also says that his accusers ""never knew what truth meant"" - again, if true, this is a terrible sin in a senior churchman. Buckingham's accusations of Wolsey carry particular weight because now that he is about to die, he has nothing to gain from lying and to do so would put his soul in peril of damnation. As if to drive home the guilt of Wolsey and his accomplices, after Buckingham exits, the two Gentlemen remark that if he is innocent, then his accusers will suffer ""curses on their heads.""
	Buckingham's invocation of the story of his father, who died for his loyalty to King Richard III, as a direct parallel to his own story, suggests that like his father, he is indeed loyal. This is backed up by the judgment of the common people and the nobility of his final speeches, which emphasize forgiveness of others and a spiritual readiness to die: ""Commend me to his grace, / And if he speaks of Buckingham, pray tell him / You met him half in heaven."" (lines 86-8).

	The Lord Chamberlain is reading a letter from one of his employees. The letter tells how Wolsey's man stole some horses from him that he had purchased on the Lord Chamberlain's behalf, declaring that his master (Wolsey) should have them, rather than a mere subject, or even the king himself. The Lord Chamberlain believes that Wolsey will take everything from the nobles to enrich himself.
	The Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk enter. Suffolk asks after the king, and the Lord Chamberlain says he is troubled in his conscience because he married his brother's wife (Katherine had been married to Henry's older brother Arthur until Arthur died, when she married Henry). Suffolk privately thinks that it is less a matter of conscience than the king's attraction to another woman (Anne Bullen). Norfolk says this is Wolsey's doing. He is amazed that Wolsey has so efficiently managed to break the alliance between Charles V and King Henry, and to make the King doubt the legality of his marriage of twenty years to his loving and virtuous wife, Katherine.
	The Lord Chamberlain says that people everywhere are talking of this, and that they are sad at the news. He says that Wolsey has engineered the situation in order to arrange a marriage between King Henry and the French king's sister. He predicts that one day, God will open the king's eyes so that he can see Wolsey for who he is. Norfolk and Suffolk agree that Wolsey is too proud.
	Norfolk and Suffolk visit the king, with the aim of distracting him from his sad thoughts. When they find him, he is angry at being disturbed. Then Wolsey comes in with Campeius. The king welcomes Wolsey as ""The quiet of my wounded conscience"" (line 74). Wolsey asks the king to give him and Campeius an hour of private conference. The king abruptly dismisses Norfolk and Suffolk. As they leave, they mutter threateningly about Wolsey.
	Wolsey tells the king that no one could object to his separating from Katherine because the king has consulted all the learned clergy of Christendom, including the Pope, who has sent Campeius as his envoy. The king agrees that Katherine should have the best scholars to argue for her. He asks for Gardiner, his new secretary, who was previously employed by Wolsey, to be sent in. As Gardiner enters, he assures Wolsey, in an aside, that his loyalty is still to him.
	Campeius asks Wolsey about Dr Pace, the man who occupied Gardiner's position before him. Campeius tells Wolsey that there are rumors that Wolsey was envious of him and kept him in foreign posts until he went mad with grief and died. Wolsey dismisses Pace as a virtuous fool.
	The king says that he will go to Blackfriars to announce his decision to leave Katherine. He is sorry to leave ""so sweet a bedfellow,"" but his conscience demands it.
	Analysis
	Wolsey's unscrupulous character is further built on in this scene. The episode where Wolsey is reported to have stolen the Lord Chamberlain's horses reinforces what we have learned about his greed and lack of scruple. There was never anything noble or worthy about a horse-thief. In addition, Campeius's account of Wolsey's keeping the previous royal secretary in foreign posts due to envy backs up Wolsey's reputation as a self-promoting schemer. Even Norfolk, who previously had taken a conciliatory attitude towards Wolsey, has now lost patience with him.
	The king is revealed as deluded. He rudely dismisses Norfolk and Suffolk, who are genuinely interested in his welfare, yet welcomes Wolsey as ""The quiet of my wounded conscience"" and ""a cure fit for a king"" (lines 74-5). This praise of Wolsey has dramatic irony (i.e. the audience/reader spots the irony, but the character who utters it is blind to it) in that we know that it was Wolsey who, for his own ends, first introduced doubts into the king's mind about the legality of his marriage to Katherine.
	In Shakespeare's plays, the question, ""Who am I?"" always has deep significance. When the king utters it (line 66), superficially, he is asking Norfolk and Suffolk how they dare disturb a king, but the question has resonance beyond this. He has wrongly allowed his supreme and God-given authority as king to be encroached upon by Wolsey, who ultimately cares only about himself. At the same time, he dismisses his loyal friends, Suffolk and Norfolk. Thus he has lost sight of who he is.
	Though Campeius has brought the Pope's decision on what Henry can or should do about his marriage, it plays little part in what follows. Henry has already made his decision to divorce Katherine, as is made clear by his speech at the end of the scene.

Summary
	Anne Bullen tells the Old Lady how sad it is to think of so good a lady as Katherine being put aside after so many years as queen. She thinks it is better to be low-born and never to have known power than to lose it in this way. She says that she would not want to be a queen. The Old Lady says she is being hypocritical, as it is natural to enjoy wealth and power. While Anne insists that she would not be queen ""for all the riches under heaven,"" the Old Lady says she herself would be queen for a few pennies.
	The Old Lady asks Anne if she would be strong enough to be a duchess. Anne says no. The Old Lady teases her by saying that in that case, she would not be strong enough to bear a male child.
	The Lord Chamberlain comes in and tells Anne that the king's high opinion of her has led him to make her Marchioness of Pembroke and give her a thousand pounds a year. Anne says that she can only offer her thanks in return, and that she prays for the king. As the Lord Chamberlain is leaving, he notes Anne's beauty and honor in an aside to the audience, and says that she may produce an heir for the king.
	The Old Lady says that she has been at court for sixteen years and never gained any advantage from it, whereas Anne has been given all she could wish for without having to try. The Old Lady reminds Anne that she did not want to be a queen. She is incredulous that the king is honoring Anne so highly just out of respect, and wonders if any other obligation is involved. She thinks that perhaps Anne feels strong enough now to be a duchess.
	Anne wonders what will happen next. She asks the Old Lady not to tell Katherine about her new title, and goes off to comfort her.
	Analysis
	The Old Lady's teasing remark that if Anne does not have the strength to be a duchess, she would not have the strength to bear a male child, would have produced wry laughter in an audience of Shakespeare's day. The Old Lady's remark is an arch reference to the fact that Anne was the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, whose birth is the climax of this play. Henry VIII had been gravely disappointed that Anne gave birth to a girl instead of a male heir (Shakespeare reverses the historical truth and has Henry laud Elizabeth's birth as the triumph of his reign). And during the early part of her reign, Elizabeth was plagued by advisors who doubted that a woman could govern a nation successfully. But Elizabeth's great success as a ruler would have given ironic weight to the Old Lady's prediction.
	This is the last time that Anne appears in this play. We learn little about her except that at the beginning of the scene she claims she would not want to be queen, or even a duchess, and yet by the end of the scene has accepted the title Marchioness of Pembroke. Later in the play, she becomes queen. We are not told why she changes her mind, but perhaps it is as the Old Lady suggests - all women like wealth and power. The Old Lady is the voice of experience, set against Anne's voice of innocence.
	Anne's first and last speeches voice her concern about Katherine. On the surface, this shows her compassion. But it also has a deeper resonance for an audience aware of the historical Anne's fate: like Katherine, she too will be discarded by Henry, though Shakespeare does not show this in his play.

Summary
	At Blackfriars, various bishops and officials have convened to decide the question of the king's marriage to Katherine. Wolsey asks for the decision from Rome to be read out, but the king says there is no need as it has already been read, and there is no need to do it again.
	Katherine goes directly to the king and kneels at his feet. She asks for justice and pity, as she is a woman and a foreigner and therefore fears that there is no impartial judge in England. She asks the king how she has offended him, as she has been a true and obedient wife to him. She has been married to him for twenty years, and they have had many children together. If anyone can prove that she has been unfaithful or has failed in her love and duty to the king, then she accepts that she should be turned away. She adds that Henry's father and her father were wise men and judged their marriage to be lawful. She asks that any decision be delayed until she can seek advice from friends in Spain.
	The king does not answer her, but Wolsey tells her that many learned men have come to plead her cause and that delay would be pointless and unsettling to her and the king. Campeius agrees that the proceedings should go ahead immediately.
	Then Katherine addresses Wolsey, telling him that she believes him to be her enemy and so she does not want him to be her judge. She says that he is responsible for stirring up trouble between her and the king. Wolsey says that her comments are out of character for her, as she is known for her gentleness and charity. He denies that he is her enemy and claims that he only acted under the authority of Rome. He also denies that he is responsible for the king's doubts about his marriage, and he hopes that the king will back him up in this.
	Katherine says she is a simple woman and unfitted to oppose Wolsey's cunning. She says that though Wolsey pretends to be humble, he is full of pride and has risen so far above his office (as Cardinal) that many who used to be powerful now act as his servants. She tells him that he cares more about his own status than his spiritual calling. She repeats that she refuses to let him judge her, curtsies to the king, and tries to leave. The king orders that she be brought back into court, but she insists that she will never again appear in court to discuss this matter, and leaves.
	The king allows her to go, and reflects that no man had a better wife. He praises her nobility and obedience. Wolsey asks the king whether he had, as Katherine alleged, induced the king to doubt his marriage. The king excuses Wolsey from Katherine's accusations and goes on to explain how he came to doubt the legality of his marriage. The French ambassador, the Bishop of Bayonne, had come to negotiate a marriage between Mary, the daughter of King Henry and Katherine, and the Duke of Orleans. The ambassador had asked whether Mary were legitimate, given that Katherine had previously been married to Henry's brother (the Bible forbids a man to marry his dead brother's wife). The question had awakened doubts in the king. He had reflected that Katherine had given birth to sons, but they had been born dead or died shortly afterwards. He felt that this was a judgment on him for contracting a marriage that was unlawful in God's eyes. He then thought about the danger to his kingdom if it were left without an heir. After a great struggle, his conscience had driven him to the solution of divorcing Katherine.
	The king had then consulted with the Bishop of Lincoln, whom he now asks to speak. The Bishop of Lincoln confirms that he advised the king to divorce Katherine. The king says he had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to decide the case in court, which the Archbishop had granted. The king insists that it is not out of dislike for Katherine that he has come to this, but out of conscience. If his marriage were proven lawful, he would be happy to remain married to her.
	Campeius says that the court must adjourn until Katherine can be persuaded to return. He also says that Katherine must not appeal to the Pope. The king suspects that the cardinals are just using delaying tactics. He looks forward to the return of Bishop Cranmer, his trusted advisor. The court breaks up.
	Analysis
	The trial to decide the legality of the marriage between Katherine and the king is as dubious as that convened to convict Buckingham. It is a mere formality. The king has already decided to divorce Katherine, as is revealed by his dismissal of Wolsey's request to have read out the papal decision that Campeius has brought from Rome.
	The fact that the king has already made his decision is reinforced by his failure to speak even a single word in reply to Katherine's impassioned plea. The cardinals Wolsey and Campeius speak for him. This also reveals the extent to which the king has ceded his authority to Wolsey.
	Katherine once again reveals herself to be the most clear-sighted person at court. She sees Wolsey's essence as the king cannot; he ignores her words about Wolsey. It is also worthy of note that Katherine's speech is as direct and clear as Wolsey's is convoluted and obscure. Wolsey is at his most mealy-mouthed when it comes to taking responsibility for his actions. While earlier, we saw Wolsey falsely claiming credit for the king's repeal of the tax, here we see him attempting to avoid censure for breaking up Katherine's marriage to the king. He shifts the responsibility onto all the cardinals of Christendom, right up to the Pope. Katherine knows that she is no match for Wolsey's cunning, and she can only withdraw from a court she knows to be partial and corrupt.
	In spite of Wolsey's appeal to the authority of the learned cardinals and the Pope, we never learn what the Pope says. This is because it is irrelevant. The divorce is a foregone conclusion, engineered by Wolsey and embraced by the king, who is impatient to replace Katherine. The king tries to convince himself and everybody else that he is pursuing the divorce because of the dictates of conscience and concern for the good of the kingdom. But this claim has already been brought into doubt by Suffolk in Act 2, scene 2, when he says that the king's attraction to Anne is the more pressing reason. Of course, both reasons may apply, but Shakespeare leaves it to the audience to decide which is paramount.
	Buckingham was the first to fall; Katherine is the second. Wolsey is behind both these events.

Summary
	Katherine is sewing with her ladies-in-waiting. She asks one of them to sing. The woman sings a song about the power of music to heal sorrow.
	A Gentleman enters and tells Katherine that the cardinals want to speak with her. As Katherine asks him to show them in, she worries about what they want with her. Wolsey and Campeius enter. Wolsey asks her if they can speak in a private room, but she says that her conscience is clear, so she is happy to speak here. Wolsey begins to speak to her in Latin, but she stops him, saying that it could make people think that there is something about her cause which must be hidden. She asks him to speak in English, for all to hear.
	Wolsey says that they have come not to accuse her, but to know her intentions in the matter of the divorce, and to give her advice and comfort. Campeius says that Wolsey, out of nobility of spirit, has forgiven Katherine for her false accusations against him, and has come to offer help. Katherine is not convinced, saying in an aside to the audience that they have come to betray her. She tells the cardinals that she needs more time to seek counsel before she can give an answer on such an important matter. She tells them she is ""a woman friendless, hopeless"" (line 80). Wolsey insists that she has both friends and hopes, but she points out that no Englishman would dare to help her, as to do so would be to oppose the king. Those friends she has, she says, are in Spain.
	Campeius and Wolsey advise her to place herself under the king's protection, since if the court's judgment goes against her, she risks being disgraced. Katherine tells them that they both wish her ruin, but that there is a higher judge that no king can corrupt - God. She says that she thought them holy men, but now sees that they are heartless and full of sin. She feels that they are enjoying seeing her misery, but warns them to be careful, lest her misfortune rebounds on them. She asks them why she should place her cause in the hands of the king, who hates her. He has banished her from his bed, and she lost his love long ago. She is old, she says, and her relationship with the king consists merely of her obedience. She has been a loving and constant wife, yet she is rewarded by being rejected. Nothing but death will separate her from her ""dignities"" - her royal title of queen and, presumably, her marriage to the king. Katherine wishes that she had never come to England. She worries about what will become of her and her ladies.
	Wolsey protests that he and Campeius mean well, and that she is wrong in her suspicions about them. He warns her that she may damage her cause with the king by her stubborn attitude. Campeius insists that the king loves her and that they only wish to do her service. Katherine tells them to do as they will, and sarcastically says that if she has misunderstood their intentions, it is because she is only a woman, lacking understanding. She says she still loves the king and prays for him.
	Analysis
	Katherine, unlike Buckingham, is not prepared to go quietly to her fate. She puts up a strong fight, accusing the cardinals of plotting to betray her and enjoying seeing her suffer. In fact, we do not know the real motives of the cardinals on this occasion or whether they are genuinely trying to help her, as they claim.
	Several times, Katherine contrasts the holy exteriors of the cardinals with their corrupt inner nature. At lines 103-4, she puns on the clergy title of ""cardinal,"" which Wolsey and Campeius both have, and the ""cardinal (meaning principal or chief) virtues"" and ""cardinal sins,"" as defined by the church. There are seven cardinal virtues: faith, hope, love, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance; and seven cardinal sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lust. While Wolsey and Campeius appear to be ""two reverend cardinal virtues,"" she fears that instead they are ""cardinal sins and hollow hearts."" Then, at line 117, she questions whether the two cardinals are ""anything but churchmen's habits"" - that is, whether they have only the external appearance of holiness and not the inner quality. At line 145, once again taking up this theme of external appearance and inner reality, she says, ""Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.""
	Katherine's fate is particularly harsh in the light of her having done nothing wrong. She has been a faultless wife and still loves Henry. He is getting rid of her because she has failed to give him a male heir, because he desires Anne, and because Wolsey is engineering the divorce. From the point of view of the play's grand purpose, however, Katherine's 'fault' is that she is not the mother of Elizabeth. Therefore she must make way for Anne.

Summary
	Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and the Lord Chamberlain are discussing the problem of Wolsey. Norfolk believes that if they all unite against Wolsey, he cannot survive. The alternative, he says, is more disgrace. The Lord Chamberlain says that they must bar Wolsey's access to the king if they want to make any sort of attack on him, since he has the king as if under his spell. Norfolk says that the king is already displeased with Wolsey, as he has evidence of his double-dealing in the divorce. Wolsey had written letters to the Pope asking him to delay his decision on the divorce until the king had got over his infatuation with Anne. Wolsey's letters were intercepted by the king.
	The Lord Chamberlain reveals that the king has already married Anne. Suffolk confirms that her coronation as queen has been arranged. Suffolk praises Anne and says that he believes she will bring blessings to England. He adds that Campeius has displeased the king by leaving for Rome without the king's permission and without having assisted in the divorce. He says that Cranmer is about to return from his tour of the famous colleges, where he has been collecting churchmen's opinions on the divorce. These opinions have supported the king. Soon, news of the king's marriage to Anne will be published. Katherine will lose her title of queen and will be called the princess dowager, and Prince Arthur's widow. Norfolk praises Cranmer for having taken such pains with the king's business. Suffolk predicts that Cranmer will be promoted to Archbishop.
	Wolsey enters with his servant, Cromwell. The Lords observe them, unseen by Wolsey. Wolsey asks Cromwell if his letters have been given to the king. Cromwell confirms that they have, and the king read them with a serious air. Cromwell leaves, and Wolsey muses that the king must marry the French king's sister, not Anne Bullen. Anne is a passionate Lutheran (and therefore a Protestant, as against Wolsey's Catholicism), and will obstruct Wolsey. Wolsey worries too about the growing influence of Cranmer, another Protestant, over the king.
	The king and Lovell enter. The king is reading a document that reveals the enormous wealth that Wolsey has accumulated. The king asks the Lords whether they have seen Wolsey. They say that they have been observing him, and that he seems very agitated. The king says this may be because an inventory of Wolsey's possessions has, probably mistakenly, been included in some state papers he had sent to the king. The king is amazed that a subject could accumulate such wealth. He suspects that Wolsey right now is musing on worldly, rather than spiritual, matters.
	Lovell summons Wolsey to the king. The king says to Wolsey that his mind must be so full of spiritual matters that he has no time to look after worldly responsibilities. Wolsey says that he allots some time to spiritual matters, some to affairs of state, and some to the demands of the body (sleep, eating, etc.). The king says that Wolsey speaks well. He goes on to say that his father, Henry VII, thought highly of Wolsey, and he himself has employed him as his closest aide. Wolsey, unnerved at where this conversation might be heading, points out that he has worked only for the good of the king and the state, and that the king's favor has been payment enough for his labors.
	The king says Wolsey has answered well, though it is clear that he doubts his integrity. The king says that a loyal subject is rewarded with honor, and a disloyal one with dishonor. Wolsey repeats that he has always worked for the king's good, not his own. Again, the king commends Wolsey's reply. He gives Wolsey the papers he has intercepted and leaves, followed by the Lords, who are smiling happily at these developments.
	Left alone, Wolsey examines the papers. When he finds the inventory of his wealth, he realizes that this has caused the king's anger. He admits that he has built up wealth for his own ends, specifically, to bribe his friends in Rome to gain the position of Pope. Then he finds his letter to the Pope, asking him to delay his decision on the divorce. He knows that he is ruined.
	Norfolk, Suffolk, Surrey and the Lord Chamberlain enter. Norfolk has been sent by the king to order Wolsey to hand back his seal of office and confine himself to his house. But Wolsey is unwilling to obey without a written warrant from the king. He accuses the Lords of envy and refuses to give up the seal except into the king's own hands. Surrey accuses Wolsey of having brought about the death of his father-in-law, Buckingham, and having sent him, Surrey, to Ireland, so that he could not seek justice. Wolsey protests that he is innocent of the death of Buckingham, who was convicted under the law by a jury. Surrey angrily replies that if Wolsey were not protected by his churchman's office, he would kill him. Surrey reminds Wolsey that he has gained wealth by extortion from the nobles, and dealt with the Pope against the king's interests. Norfolk tells Wolsey that he has a list of articles, written by the king, enumerating Wolsey's misdeeds. Wolsey insists that he will be able to prove his innocence to the king. Suffolk says he remembers some of the king's complaints against Wolsey, and Wolsey will not be able to save himself.
	The Lords begin to read out the list of articles against Wolsey drawn up by the king. First, Wolsey made himself the Pope's representative without the king's consent. Second, in letters to Rome and foreign monarchs, he wrote, ""I and my king,"" implying that the king was his servant. The Lords read out other crimes that Wolsey is guilty of, including having his cardinal's hat stamped on the king's coins and bribing the Pope. The Lord Chamberlain, feeling sorry for Wolsey, stops the Lords from reading any further, saying that they must leave him to the law. Surrey says he forgives Wolsey. Suffolk tells Wolsey that the king has ordered that all Wolsey's property should be forfeited and that he is no longer under the king's protection. Norfolk tells Wolsey that the king will be informed about his unwillingness to give up his seal of office, and the Lords leave him on his own to ponder on ""how to live better.""
	Wolsey reflects that his life has been like that of a plant, which grows, blooms, and then is killed by a sudden frost. He also compares himself to little boys who swim out of their depth, using swim bladders to keep them afloat. His pride has burst, just as swim bladders can burst, and has now left him at the mercy of the ""rude stream"" (lline 364) of events. He denounces the vain glories of this world, and feels that his heart has been ""new open'd."" Those who depend on royal favors are in a precarious position, and when they fall, it is as Lucifer fell from heaven, ""Never to hope again"" (line 372).
	Cromwell enters and weeps at Wolsey's fate. But Wolsey tells him he is now at peace and has never been happier. He knows himself now. The king has cured him (of the disease of pride), for which he is thankful. He feels strong enough to endure even more miseries, and certainly more than his enemies could offer. Cromwell reports to Wolsey that Sir Thomas More is to replace him as Lord Chancellor, and that Cranmer has been welcomed home, and made Archbishop of Canterbury. Lastly, he reports that Anne Bullen, who has been secretly married to the king for some time, has appeared in public for the first time as queen and that her coronation is expected soon.
	Wolsey realizes that Anne has been his downfall. He tells Cromwell to leave him, as he is ""a poor fall'n man,"" and to go to the king, who will promote him. Cromwell cannot bear to leave his master. He tells him that though the king shall have his service, Wolsey shall have his prayers. Wolsey is moved to tears. He tells Cromwell that when he is dead and forgotten, he must tell the world that Wolsey showed him an honorable route to success - one that Wolsey himself had missed. He advises Cromwell to reject ambition, to love himself last, to value his enemies, and to remember that honesty will serve him better than corruption. He must serve his country, God, and truth. If he does all this and still falls, then ""Thou fall'st a blessed martyr."" He asks Cromwell to take the inventory of his possessions to the king, who now owns them all. He ends by saying that if he had served God with half the zeal with which he served his king, God would not have abandoned him to his enemies. His hopes now are fixed on heaven.
	Analysis
	This scene tracks Wolsey's fall. Until now, we have seen Wolsey largely through the eyes of his enemies, and this tradition is continued into the beginning of this scene, when we see the Lords delighting in the fact that the king has found evidence against Wolsey and anticipating his downfall. But with Wolsey's entrance, at last we see him speak for himself. As is usual with Shakespeare, the more we learn of him, the more we are able to see his human and sympathetic aspects alongside his less admirable qualities.
	When we first see Wolsey, he still believes he is at the height of his powers. The impression we gain of him is largely unsympathetic. We see him plotting to marry off the king to the French king's sister and dismissing Anne Bullen as unsuitable. In terms of the grand purpose of the play, this is unacceptable, as Anne is necessary in order to give birth to Elizabeth. His interaction with the king also shows him in a bad light. He claims that all his actions have been for the good of the king and the state and his only reward the king's ""graces,"" whereas we are aware that the king holds in his hand an inventory of Wolsey's massive wealth. In this respect, he is dishonest.
	It is a brilliant stroke on Shakespeare's part to have the king refrain from confronting Wolsey about his dishonesty directly. Instead, the king merely praises Wolsey's noble-sounding speeches, and as he leaves, gives to Wolsey his own inventory of possessions. Wolsey only has to see the paper to know that his career is no more. In this way, Shakespeare gives the impression that it is not the hostility of the king that brings Wolsey down, but Wolsey's own overweening pride, of which the king cures him. This is confirmed by Wolsey later in the scene, when he says, ""The king has cur'd me, / I humbly thank his grace"" (lines 380-1).
	Wolsey's subsequent interaction with the Lords is psychologically revealing and shows him in an even worse light than his interaction with the king. From the time he sees his letter to the Pope in the packet intercepted by the king, he knows that he is ruined (lines 222-7). But he treats the Lords, who have been sent by the king, with reckless contempt, refusing to surrender the seal of office to anyone but the king in person. His taunting question, ""Now, who'll take it?"" (line 250) is reminiscent of the challenge a school bully in possession of the ball might shout to other smaller or weaker boys. His action is also extraordinarily inappropriate for a churchman, who is not supposed to form attachments to worldly things and is certainly not supposed physically to hang onto his badge of office when the king has requested him to give it up. However, at the same time, the indignity of the incident awakens our pity for Wolsey, unable to give up the symbol of the high office he has striven to gain.
	With the Lords, Wolsey continues to avoid taking responsibility for his actions, telling Surrey that the law, not he, was responsible for Buckingham's execution - a similar excuse to the one he used for the unfair taxes in Act 1. He also insists that the king will exonerate him when he knows of his loyalty - another dishonest claim, since he has already proclaimed his loyalty to the king and not been believed.
	When Wolsey is left alone by the Lords, he begins his journey into self-awareness. He compares himself to a small boy who, lulled into a false sense of security by using inflated bladders to keep him afloat, swims out of his depth only to find that the bladders have burst, leaving him without support. His pride was his swim bladder, keeping him afloat: now that the king has burst it, he is left to the mercy of the ""rude stream"" of fate. He also compares himself to Lucifer, who fell from heaven, ""Never to hope again"" (line 372). Though this image adds to the whiff of devilry surrounding Wolsey, it also vividly portrays the depth of his despair and the extent of his self-condemnation for his vanity.
	Wolsey is most sympathetic in the last part of his final scene. The lords have told Wolsey of the king's order that all his goods will be forfeit, and that he will no longer enjoy the king's protection. He has no worldly goods or status. But as so often in Shakespeare (e.g. in King Lear and As You Like It), this is the perfect time for him to achieve peace and self-knowledge. Left alone by the lords, Wolsey renounces the ""vain pomp and glory of this world"" and says, significantly, ""I feel my heart new open'd"" (lines 365-6). This last statement paves the way for what happens next.
	Wolsey's servant, Cromwell, comes in. A silence falls upon the stage. When Cromwell sees the broken Wolsey, he begins to weep in sympathy. It is plain that, whatever Wolsey's faults were, he was loved by his servant. Cromwell only wants to know how Wolsey is - after so much language has been spent in lying, equivocation and power-play, it is moving to hear words spoken in a spirit of pure love and acceptance. It is no coincidence that it is in this context that Wolsey, finally freed from his habits of grasping and manipulation, replies from a place of perfect serenity, ""Why, well; / Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell; / I know myself now, and I feel within me / A peace above all earthly dignities, / A still and quiet conscience. The king has cur'd me."" (lines 376-80). He goes on to counsel Cromwell to renounce ambition and work only for God, his country and the truth. Self-knowledge is invariably the highest good in Shakespeare's plays, and Wolsey achieves it, though via a difficult path and at the expense of many others, including Buckingham, Katherine and the nobles he impoverished.

Summary
	The two Gentlemen meet in the street. They are waiting to see Anne pass by on her way back from her coronation. The Second Gentleman recalls that the last time they met, it was to see Buckingham coming from his trial. That was an occasion of sorrow, whereas this is one of joy. They discuss who is to be promoted today: Suffolk is to be made high steward, and Norfolk earl marshal. The First Gentleman reports that Cranmer has held another court to decide the matter of the divorce. Katherine was often called, but refused to attend. The court ruled that the king and Katherine were divorced, and she has been moved to the country, where she is now ill. The Second Gentleman expresses pity for her. They are interrupted by Anne's coronation procession, which includes Suffolk, Norfolk, Anne, and other nobles and officials.
	The Second Gentleman remarks on Anne's beauty. A third Gentleman arrives. He has seen the ceremony and describes it to the others, emphasizing Anne's beauty and the people's joy. Anne was crowned by Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The coronation feast is being held in Wolsey's former house, which is now the king's and renamed Whitehall. The Second Gentleman says that Gardiner has been promoted from the king's secretary to Bishop of Winchester. He adds that Gardiner does not like Cranmer. The Third Gentleman says that this does not matter, as Cranmer has a good friend in Cromwell, whom the king so respects that he has made him master of the jewel house and a member of the privy council.
	Scene 2 opens at Kimbolton, where a sick Katherine is led in by Griffith, her servant, and Patience, her maid. Griffith asks how she is, and she replies that she is deathly ill. She has heard that Wolsey is dead, which Griffith confirms. She asks how he died. Griffith says that the Earl of Northumberland arrested him at York, but on his way to answer the charges against him, he fell sick and died a penitent man in the abbey at Leicester. Katherine says she will speak of him charitably, but goes on to describe his ambition, arrogance, lying and underhand dealing. She also criticizes his habit of ambiguity in speech and his lack of pity for others, and says he set a bad example for the clergy.
	Griffith asks Katherine's permission to speak about Wolsey's good points, which she gladly grants. He says that he rose from humble stock, was a fine scholar from his earliest years, and was clever in speech. He was rude to those who disliked him, but sweet to those who asked him for help. He founded two colleges at Ipswich and Oxford, one of which survived his death, and became renowned throughout Christendom. Finally, Griffith suggests that he was happiest after his fall: he achieved self-knowledge and found the blessedness of being little"" (line 66).
	Katherine is impressed by Griffith's honest but appreciative speech and says she wishes that he would speak about her after her death. He has brought her to honor Wolsey, whom she hated when he was alive. She wishes him peace. She tells her attendants that she is near death, then asks for music and falls asleep.
	Katherine sees a vision of six people dressed in white, apparently spirits, wearing gold masks and garlands round their heads. They dance around Katherine and hold a garland over her head. As if inspired, in her sleep, she holds up her hands joyously to heaven. The dancers vanish and Katherine wakes, sad that the spirits have left her behind. She asks her attendants where they are, but they have seen no one. She tells them that the spirits invited her to a banquet and promised her eternal happiness. Her attendants see that she is dying.
	A Messenger comes in and says that the king has sent a gentleman to see her. Lord Capuchius, an ambassador from Katherine's nephew, King Charles V of Spain, enters. Capuchius brings words of comfort from the king, who is concerned for Katherine in her illness. Katherine says his comfort comes too late; she is past all comfort except for prayers. She asks after the king's health and wishes him well. Then she asks her maid to bring the letter she wrote to the king. In her letter, Katherine asks the king to look after their daughter, Mary, and to love her. She also asks the king to look after her ladies-in-waiting, who have been loyal, and to find them good husbands. Finally, she asks the king to pay her manservants. She asks Capuchius to remind the king of her ""in all humility"", that she will no longer be a trouble to him and that she blessed him as she was dying. She asks her ladies to help her to bed.
	Analysis
	In the street scene, Shakespeare deliberately juxtaposes the fall of one of the king's favorites with the rise of another. A Gentleman recalls that the last time they met, it was to see Buckingham on his way from his trial; this time, it is to see Anne coming from her coronation. And no sooner does a Gentleman ask after Katherine and receive his answer that she is sick, than her replacement, Anne, appears in full coronation regalia. There could be no clearer indication of the transient nature of royal favor.
	Katherine and Griffith act as a chorus in this scene, with Katherine enumerating Wolsey's faults and sins, and Griffith emphasizing his good points. In line with the play's theme of forgiveness triumphing over accusation and recrimination, Katherine is able to forgive Wolsey after hearing Griffith speak well of him.
	Neither Wolsey nor Katherine lives for long after being cast off by the king. Katherine, like Wolsey, makes a 'good' death, as is made plain by her heavenly vision of spirits promising eternal happiness. The vision comes after she forgives Wolsey. This is not coincidence but a sign that Katherine has prepared herself for heaven partly by her act of forgiveness. The name of her maid, Patience, is also significant, as this is the quality that Katherine most has need of at this point in her life, hence her lines, ""Nay Patience, / You must not leave me yet"" (lines 165-6). She emphatically lacked patience when she stormed out of the courtroom at her trial (Act 2, scene 4), but feels that she has cultivated it by Act 3, scene 1, line 138, when she boasts of her ""great patience.""
	Patience is a quality that several of the characters are forced to learn. Buckingham at the start of the play lacks it, perhaps to a fatal degree, as we see in his hotheaded attempt to rush off and tell the king about Wolsey's alleged treason - before he is counseled by Norfolk to exercise restraint. In his speech before his execution, he expresses forgiveness of his accusers and acceptance of his state. Cranmer already has it in abundance, as we shall see in Act 5, scene 2, where he is forced to wait outside the council chamber door in spite of the fact that he is a council member. He does so without anger.
	Another notable character trait of Katherine is her generosity, as shown by her concern for the welfare of her servants after her death.

Summary
	It is one o'clock at night. Bishop Gardiner enters with his Page. Lovell rushes in. Gardiner asks why he is in haste, and Lovell reveals that Queen Anne is in labor, and it is feared that she may not survive. Gardiner says that he prays for the baby, but believes that Anne is not of good enough stock to provide the heir to the throne. He says that things will not go well for England until Anne and her two allies, Cranmer and Cromwell, are dead. Lovell points out that Cranmer and Cromwell are the two men most favored by the king. But Gardiner says that he has already told the council that Cranmer is a heretic, and the king has ordered the council to convene tomorrow morning to examine him. Gardiner says that Cranmer is a ""rank weed,"" ""And we must root him out"" (lines 52-3).
	The king and Suffolk enter. The king asks Lovell how Anne's labor is progressing. Lovell delivers a message from Anne asking the king to pray for her. The king is concerned and asks to be left alone. Suffolk leaves.
	Sir Anthony Denny brings in Cranmer, who is worried by the king's frown. The king tells Cranmer that he has heard some serious complaints about him, and that he must come before the council tomorrow morning to answer them. The king warns Cranmer that he will not be able to prove his innocence instantly, and so while the complaints are being investigated he may have to be patient and accept imprisonment in the Tower of London. Cranmer thanks the king for the warning, and says he knows he is subject to many malicious rumors. He says he does not fear anything that can be said against him, and will rely upon his truth and honesty. But the king warns him that he has powerful enemies and it is possible that corrupt witnesses will be brought to testify against him. Cranmer hopes that God and the king will protect him, or he will certainly fall into the trap that is laid for him.
	The king advises Cranmer to use his persuasive powers to avoid imprisonment. He gives Cranmer a ring and tells him to show it to the council if they try to imprison him. The council will then have to allow Cranmer's appeal to be heard by the king himself. Cranmer is overcome with gratitude, and weeps. The king swears he is honest and says there is not a better soul in his kingdom. Cranmer leaves.
	An Old Lady enters with the news that Anne has given birth. He demands to be told that it is a boy, so the Old Lady agrees that it is a boy. She quickly adds that it is, in fact, a girl who ""promises boys hereafter"" (line 166), and who looks exactly like him. The king rushes off to see the baby, who is the future Queen Elizabeth I.
	Analysis
	At the first murmurings of discontent about Cranmer from Gardiner, we know that it is Cranmer's turn to fall. Gardiner seems to have no real reason for denouncing Cranmer, and we can only surmise that he does so out of loyalty to his old master, Wolsey. Cranmer's sudden fall from the court's favor seems even more arbitrary than the falls of his predecessors - Buckingham, Katherine, and Wolsey.
	One difference between Cranmer's fall and that of the others is that the king forms an independent opinion of him and decides to actively help him. We are not told why this is, but it could be that the king genuinely believes Cranmer to be innocent and thus wants him to keep his position. Another factor which certainly plays a part is that the king is at last free from the ""witchcraft"" (Act 3, scene 2, line 18) of Wolsey's influence, and has taken full control of his realm.
	The Old Lady's statement that Anne has given birth to a boy, which she rapidly amends to a girl who ""promises boys hereafter,"" would have raised a laugh among all those who remembered Queen Elizabeth I. In fact, Henry's only son, Edward VI, died young, leaving Henry's and Katherine's daughter Mary to inherit the throne. When Mary died childless, Elizabeth was proclaimed queen. It took time and determination for Elizabeth to convince her advisors and subjects that a woman could rule England, and without a husband at her side, and do it well - but she still felt that she had to apologise for being a mere ""weak and feeble woman.""

Summary
	Cranmer arrives at the council chamber, hoping he is not late. But the doorkeeper will not let him in, saying he must wait outside the door until he is called. Dr Butts, the king's physician, sees how Cranmer is being treated, and condemns it as malice, since Cranmer is himself a member of the council. Butts leaves to tell the king what has happened.
	Cranmer is unnerved by Butts' concerned look; he hopes it does not mean he is about to be disgraced. He is now certain that this is a trap set for him by his enemies. Butts leads the king to a window from where they can observe events, and shows him how Cranmer, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is being kept waiting outside the door with the servants. The king is surprised that one so much favored by him should be humiliated in this way. He says that it is a good thing that his authority exceeds that of the council.
	The Lord Chancellor leads in the nobles who constitute the council. Cranmer is finally allowed in. The Lord Chancellor tells Cranmer that he is here because he has been teaching dangerous and heretical new ideas around the kingdom. Gardiner goes further, alleging that Cranmer must be stopped from spreading such ideas immediately or revolutions and riots will break out, as has already happened in continental Europe. Cranmer says that he has been careful not to stir up trouble with his teachings, and has always opposed those who do. He believes he is the victim of envy and malice, and asks to be brought face-to-face with his accusers so that he can debate them openly. But Suffolk points out that because Cranmer is a council member, no one can accuse him of anything.
	Gardiner breaks in, saying that they have more important business to get on with, and so he will be brief. The king and the council wish Cranmer to be imprisoned in the Tower, which will reduce to the status of a common man once more, so that his accusers can charge him openly. Cranmer sarcastically thanks Gardiner for his kindness, and says that he sees that Gardiner is out to ruin him. He counsels Gardiner that love and humility are more fitting for a churchman than ambition. He says he has no doubt that he can clear himself. Gardiner accuses Cranmer of being an adherent of a sect (Protestantism). Cromwell rebukes Gardiner for being too sharp to ""a falling man."" Gardiner turns his attack on Cromwell, accusing him of favoring the same ""new sect"" as Cranmer.
	The Lord Chancellor silences the men and gives the order for Cranmer to be taken to the Tower. Gardiner calls in the Guard. Cranmer is shocked that he is being taken away like a traitor. He asks to speak first, and shows them the king's ring, saying that it gives him the right to be heard by the king himself. The council members see that they underestimated how much Cranmer enjoyed the king's favor. Suffolk confirms that the ring is the king's and reminds the others that he told them, when they first moved against Cranmer, that it would rebound on them. Norfolk agrees that the king will not allow Cranmer to be harmed. Cromwell says he suspected that no good would come of trying to build a case against Cranmer, whose honesty is renowned.
	At that moment, the king, who has left the window from which he was observing the council meeting, enters. Gardiner greets the king in a flattering speech, but the king is not impressed, saying that this is no time for flattery. The king says that Gardiner cannot hide his misdeeds and his cruel nature. He had thought that the council members were men of wisdom, but now he sees that they are not. He says they were wrong to make Cranmer wait outside the door like a servant. He gave the council authority to try Cranmer as an equal, not an inferior, but he sees that some of them are pursuing him out of malice. The Lord Chancellor protests that they were only planning to imprison Cranmer in order to give him a fair trial. The king says that he himself owes much to Cranmer, and orders the council members to embrace him and be friends. Then he asks Cranmer to baptize his daughter, Elizabeth. Gardiner does not immediately embrace Cranmer, so the king asks him again. Gardiner does so, ""with a true heart."" Cranmer weeps and gives thanks. The king says that what everyone says about Cranmer is true: a man may do him an injury, and he is his friend forever. The king urges the council members to remain unified and leads them all off to the baptism.
	Analysis
	For the first time, a person who is set up to fall does not do so. Buckingham, Katherine and Wolsey all succumbed, but Cranmer escapes a similar, seemingly inevitable, fate. This is because Cranmer is the only one who has done nothing wrong. Whereas Buckingham may have had treasonous intentions, Cranmer is universally renowned for his honesty and integrity. Gardiner's objection to Cranmer - that he teaches heresy - would have been roundly discredited in the eyes of Shakespeare's officially Protestant audience because Gardiner is a sworn ally of the Catholic Wolsey and Cranmer is one of the pioneers of Protestantism. Henry VIII began the movement towards Protestantism when he created himself head of the Church of England (independent of the authority of the Pope) in order to get his divorce from Katherine and marry Anne. Cranmer supported the king in this process. When Henry's daughter Elizabeth came to the throne, she made Protestantism the official religion of England, a move that helped unify the nation and ended years of sectarian unrest. Thus, in terms of the grand purpose of the play - celebrating the arrival of the Protestant Elizabeth - Cranmer was on the 'right' side of history and could not be punished. Wolsey and Katherine, on the other hand, with their Catholic allegiance to the Pope and opposition to the king's marriage to Anne, were on the 'wrong' side and stood in the way of Elizabeth's destiny. Thus, they had to go.
	Another reason why Cranmer survives is that the king, for the first time in the series of falls, takes a fully active role. In the trial of Buckingham, the king was essentially Wolsey's puppet, unquestioningly believing suspect witnesses and ignoring Katherine's warnings of partiality. At Katherine's trial, the king also took a back seat. He expressed sadness at losing such a good wife, but would not engage with her and went along with his advisors - driven partly, of course, by his attraction to Anne and need for an heir. With Wolsey, the king is more active, but the type of action is significant: he merely listens politely to Wolsey's protestations of goodness and loyalty before silently handing to him his own incriminating letters. The sense is that Wolsey has undone himself by his own double-dealing and greed; the king has merely been the messenger. Moreover, the king takes no further part in Wolsey's fate.
	But the matter is different with Cranmer. In giving Cranmer his ring, the king ensures that whatever happens at the council meeting, the archbishop will be under his protection. Sure enough, as soon as Cranmer produces the ring, the council members know their game is up. The king has been watching the council proceedings unseen, and we in turn have been watching the king. It is as if the extra eyes and ears following the proceedings throw them open to daylight and end the dark machinations that have been going on. The king enters the council chamber, rebukes the members for pursuing the innocent Cranmer, and orders them to reconcile with him. In asking Cranmer to baptize Elizabeth, the king shows everyone how much he honors Cranmer, and shifts the focus from petty persecutions and resentments to joy at the new life and hope that Elizabeth represents, and her future reign of peace and prosperity.

Summary
	A large crowd of people has gathered at the court entrance to see the baby Elizabeth, who is being christened today. A Porter is trying in vain to keep the crowd away from the entrance so that the royal party can pass through. The Lord Chamberlain enters and rebukes the Porter for not ensuring that there will be enough room for the ladies of the christening party to pass. He says the Porter and his men are lazy, and tells them to make room or face prison.
	Trumpets sound to announce the arrival of the royal party. The Porter shouts at the crowd to make way. The procession enters, with the Duchess of Norfolk carrying the princess Elizabeth under the royal canopy. The king enters.
	Cranmer makes a speech in which he prophesies a great future for Elizabeth. She will bring many blessings to the nation and will be an example of good government for her successors. She will be virtuous, loved and respected. England will enjoy peace and prosperity under her reign. She will die a virgin, and, as the mythical phoenix is reborn out of its own ashes, her successor will inherit her greatness, and found new nations (a reference to the English colonization of America, which started in earnest in James I's reign).
	The King is pleased with Cranmer's words. He feels that producing Elizabeth was his greatest accomplishment. He says that after he is dead, he will take delight in watching what Elizabeth does from heaven. He leads the party off to greet the queen.
	The Epilogue enters and says he is sure that the play could not have pleased everyone. Some came to sleep, but have been woken up by the trumpets, so they will not be pleased. Others came to see the ordinary citizens made fun of, but they will have been disappointed. The only people who will be pleased with the play are good women, who will be happy at seeing another good woman portrayed in the character of Katherine. And if they like the play, and clap, then their men will feel they have to follow.
	Analysis
	Cranmer's speech prophesying Elizabeth's great future is the climax of the play and the end to which all the plotlines have been leading. Henry's delight in his daughter as his greatest achievement also excuses, by implication, the mistakes and relative chaos of his reign. His role was ultimately to bring her into the world.
	Cranmer also predicts that all Elizabeth's good qualities will be carried on in her heir, James I, who ruled England at the time when Henry VIII was written. Shakespeare is complimenting James by describing him as the worthy successor to Elizabeth.

When Joseph comes in looking for Heathcliff, Ellen calls for him outside but gets no answer. She then tells Catherine that he had heard some of what she said, and she gets frightened. Catherine runs outside to look for Heathcliff, and finally comes back, saying she will not go upstairs until she gets to talk to him.

Chapter 11: The next time Heathcliff comes to the Grange he finds Isabella in the garden, and Ellen sees them talk and then embrace. Catherine also sees, and she asks Heathcliff what it is all about. The two of them fight, Heathcliff saying that Catherine has treated him infernally and that he is unrevenged. Ellen sees Edgar in the house and tells him what she saw between Heathcliff and Isabella and that he and Catherine are fighting in the kitchen. He has a few servants wait outside, and he goes into the kitchen and tells Catherine that he has been too lenient, but that from now on Heathcliff is not welcome in their home and must leave instantly. Heathcliff is amused by Linton's threats, and when Linton signals Ellen to let the servants in, Catherine realizes what is going on and locks the door, scolding Edgar for not being man enough to face Heathcliff alone. Edgar is quite frightened now, and when Heathcliff kicks the chair he is leaning on, he springs up and strikes Heathcliff hard in the throat. He then runs out to get men to help him. Heathcliff wants to stay and have it out with Linton, but when he sees him approaching with other men, he thinks better of it and makes his escape.
	Catherine is quite distraught and has Ellen go upstairs with her. Catherine tells her that she will break both of their hearts by breaking her own. Edgar comes in and asks Catherine if she will have no more to do with Heathcliff now, and she yells at him to leave her alone. Ellen brings her some water, but she will not drink, and Edgar gets quite worried about her distraction, but Ellen tells him that she is just acting frantic. The next morning Catherine does not eat at all, and the next day she again wants no food. Edgar spends his time in the library reading, and does not ask about Catherine. He tries to talk to Isabella about what happened with Heathcliff, but she will not talk to him about it, and he can do nothing but warn her that if she were to encourage him they could no longer be family.
	Chapter 12: Ellen decides to run for the doctor, and when she enters the garden, she sees Isabella's dog suspended by a handkerchief and about to die. She releases it and runs on. The doctor asks about Heathcliff, and says that he had heard that he and Isabella had been seen together the night before. This news frightens Ellen, and when she goes into Isabella's room, she finds it empty. She does not want to tell Edgar of it then, as he is busy with Catherine. The doctor tells them to keep Catherine in perfect tranquillity. They all are busy taking care of her, and eventually a maid comes to say that Isabella has run off with Heathcliff. She says that she heard it from another that they were seen together in the middle of the night. Linton says that no one is to go after them as Isabella went of her own accord. He says that they are to talk of her no more, for while he did not disown her, she disowned him.

Hindley had planned to be at Catherine's funeral and had stayed up and tried not to drink, but then he got in suicidal low spirits and had to stay home and drink. She and Hindley were together when they heard Heathcliff finally coming home. Hindley asked if they should lock him out, and they did. Then Hindley told her that they should return his violence and treachery and Isabella agreed. He then however, took a pistol out. This is not what Isabella had meant, and she could not let Hindley kill Heathcliff, so she tried to warn him. They all yelled angrily at each other until Heathcliff broke through a window and jumped at Hindley. The knife part of the gun struck Hindley, and while was down Heathcliff beat him. He then called Joseph in to care for Hindley and clean up his blood, but remembering Isabella, he made her do it.
	The next morning Isabella came down and saw that Hindley was quite ill. Isabella was glad to see how much Heathcliff was grieving over Catherine as she wanted to see him suffer. She said that Catherine would not have let him beat on Hindley like that, and that everyone knew that she would be alive now if not for Heathcliff. This angers Heathcliff much, and he throws a knife at Isabella, striking her below the ear. She pulls the knife out, throws one at Heathcliff and runs out of the house, looking back to see Heathcliff and Hindley fighting.

Time heals some of his wounds, and he finds comfort in his daughter, who has been named Catherine. Hindley dies about six months after Catherine. The doctor tells Ellen that he died as he lived, drunk. Ellen goes to the lawyer and to Wuthering Heights to see about the funeral. She learns that Hindley was quite in debt and had mortgaged everything. Ellen tries to get Hareton out of the Heights, but Heathcliff says he will fight for him, and Edgar does not pursue the matter.

	Chapter 18:  The next twelve years are quite happy according to Ellen.  Young Catherine grows to be a beautiful and good child, although she can sometimes be saucy.  At this time she has never been beyond the park by herself. She is a perfect recluse, and knows nothing of Wuthering Heights or Heathcliff.  About this time Isabella writes to Edgar to say that she is ill and will not live.  She asks him to come and see her and get Linton so that he can raise him, and he goes.  Catherine asks Ellen if she can go riding and she does, not coming back for tea.  Ellen goes to look for her, and after searching a while, sees her dogs and horse outside Wuthering Heights.  She finds her inside talking happily with Hareton.  Ellen tries to get her to go, saying that she would not be there if she knew whose house it was.  Thinking Hareton might be a servant, Cathy tells him to get her horse.  He then growls that he will not be her servant, and curses her.  Catherine is quite surprised, as she has never had anyone speak to her like this.  The housekeeper there tells her that Hareton is her cousin, and she does not believe it, saying that her father will soon be coming back with her real cousin.  Ellen is quite distressed, as she realizes that now Heathcliff will hear that his son is coming to Thrushcross Grange.  Ellen finally gets Catherine to leave, asking her to not tell her father about what happened because her father objects to the household at the Heights.

Divine Comedy: Summary: Inferno section 1- Inferno section 5,"Inferno section 1: Dante's journey through Hell (Inferno), Purgatory (Purgatorio), and Heaven (Paradiso) takes place in 1300, at the midpoint of his life.  Dante sets himself as the narrator and main character of this epic poem.  His flight through Hell begins in a dark and unknown forest.  As Dante wanders through the woods he comes to a hill above which shines the first sunlight that he has encountered in the forest.  But as Dante begins to climb the hill a leopard blocks his path.  As Dante retreats, a lion and a she-wolf join the leopard in driving Dante back into the dark valley.  Rushing terrified down the hill Dante encounters a shadowy figure.  The figure reveals itself to be the spirit of Virgil, the master poet from Mantua who lived during the reign of Julius Caesar, before the coming of Christ.  Directing Dante to take a path around the beasts on the hillside, Virgil becomes Dante's teacher and guide through Hell and parts of Purgatory.
	Inferno section 2: Night begins to fall on Virgil and Dante as they begin their journey.  Invoking the Muses with, ""O Muses, o high genius, help me now,"" Dante wonders whether or not he is worthy to take such a momentous trip.  Comparing himself to others-Aeneas and St. Paul-- who have journeyed into the underworld, Dante does not feel he is up to the task.  Virgil comforts Dante and quells his misgivings by telling him that Beatrice, sent by the Virgin Mary, asked Virgil to rescue Dante from his wanderings and to be his guide for her sake.  After Virgil asks Dante, ""Why do you resist? Why does your heart host so much cowardice? Where are your daring and your openness,"" Dante gathers his resolve and the pair move on.
	Inferno section 3: Dante's first encounter with Hell is the inscription over its gates, ""Through me the way into the suffering city, through me the way to the eternal pain, through me the way that runs among the lost.Abandon every hope, who enter here."" Virgil reminds Dante to have courage and leads him into Hell, a dark and starless abyss filled with terrible noise.  Virgil explains that the cries that Dante hears are those of the uncommitted, souls who were neither rebellious against God nor faithful to Satan.  These souls occupy the Vestibule, a portion of Hell outside the formal First Circle.  Neither Heaven nor Hell would take these souls so their punishment is to spend eternity running through the Vestibule behind a banner while wasps and horseflies sting them and worms at their feet feed on their blood and tears. 
	Dante and Virgil continue to the river Acheron, the border between the Vestibule and the First Circle.  Many souls wait on the shores of the river for the boatman, Charon to carry them across.  Charon does not want to help Dante because he is still alive but Virgil, as he will often do during this journey, commands the underworld guardian to let Dante pass because his mission was willed in Heaven.  As they cross the river, Virgil tells Dante that the sinners on the shores are compelled by ""celestial justice"" to cross the river into Hell.  As the poet finishes his discussion of Charon and the river, violent winds and fires from the ground accompany the tremors of a giant earthquake.  Terrified by the chaotic rumblings, Dante faints away.
	Inferno section 4: Loud thunder stirs Dante from his sleep.  Dante finds himself in a new place, on the edge of an abyss the bottom of which he cannot see.  As Virgil and Dante descend into the First Circle, Limbo, they hear quiet sighs and moans of sadness.  Virgil explains that the souls that make these pitiful sounds belong to humans who led blameless lives but were never baptized.  Virgil, who died before Christianity, lives in Limbo where his punishment is to never be able to see God.  Dante expresses sorrow because the souls he meets in Limbo belong to great men.  As Virgil and Dante walk, Dante sees a fire around which the most honored souls rest.  As they approach the fire, Dante recognizes the shades (spirits) as Homer, Horace, Lucan, and Ovid, great classical poets.  The group salutes Dante as one of them as the stroll toward a castle with seven walls surrounded by a stream.  Upon entering the enclosed area, Dante finds more masters of ancient philosophy and mathematics-Plato, Cicero, Socrates, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and ""the master of the men who know"" (Aristotle).  Dante and Virgil move from this hallowed, calm place to a place ""where no thing gleams.""
	Inferno section 5: As Dante and Virgil descend in the Second Circle they meet Minos whose job it is to judge condemned souls.  Minos wraps his tail around his body to indicate the number of the circle in Hell to which the soul must fall.  Again, Virgil commands Minos to let Dante pass because his journey was commanded in Heaven (although Virgil does not use the word ""Heaven"" because to do so in Hell would be blasphemous).  Once Minos lets the poets pass they encounter a pit filled with shrieking and moaning spirits that flail about in the winds of an eternal storm.  The Second Circle houses the souls that were lustful on Earth.  Dante pities these souls and asks to speak with one of them.  Meet Francesca, a woman whose husband kills her and her beloved Paolo for succumbing to one lustful kiss.  Paolo stands by as Francesca tells their story.  Moved by pity and sadness, Dante faints.

Inferno section 6: Dante awakens to find himself in the Third Circle where rain, snow, and hail fall endlessly to the stinking ground.  Here, the Gluttons run around the pit eternally trying to avoid the sharp claws of the three-headed guardian of this Circle, Cerberus.  As Virgil throws dirt into the monster's mouth to silence him, Dante notices a shade that, unlike the other spirits, does not lie on the ground.  This spirit belongs to Ciacco, a citizen of Florence who Dante knew in life.  Ciacco, well known for his gluttony, prophesies that war will occur and one party will be expelled from the city.  The two Florentines commiserate over the plight of their city and discuss the fates of other citizens who, Ciacco says, were banished to lower parts of Hell for their heinous crimes.  As Virgil and Dante move away, Virgil explains to Dante that Ciacco will stay as he is in this Circle until Last Judgement.  Although these souls will never reach Heaven, they will be nearer to it and feel more pleasure and more pain after Last Judgement.
	Inferno section 7: Plutus, who has swelled to an enormous size, blocks the poets' path as they try to descend into the Fourth Circle.  But when Virgil explains that their journey is willed in Heaven, Plutus falls weakly to the ground and the Virgil and Dante pass unharmed.  In the Fourth Circle, two groups of shades roll giant weights in opposite directions.  At the end of their semi-circular paths the two groups crash into each other and continue their torment again in the opposite direction.  Every time the two groups crash, one yells, ""Why do you hoard?"" While the other group yells, ""Why do you squander?"" These two groups, the avaricious and the prodigal, continue this sorry task for all eternity.  Virgil explains that most of the spirits in this realm belong to popes, priests, and cardinals who mismanaged worldly goods whether with avarice or with prodigality.  Virgil also warns Dante against being greedy for the goods of Fortune.  Dante asks him to explain Fortune and Virgil responds, ""She is the one so frequently maligned even by those who should give praise to her-they blame her wrongfully with words of scorn.  But she is blessed and does not hear these things; for with the other primal beings, happy, she turns her sphere and glories in her bliss.""
	With that, Virgil beckons Dante to follow him into the next Circle.  As they descend, they approach the river Styx and find the souls of the Wrathful and Sullen bobbing in the slimy murk.  The Fifth Circle of Hell belongs to the Wrathful shades who lash out at each other, tearing ""each other piecemeal with their teeth."" Alongside the Wrathful live the Sullen shades who, because they ""had been sullen in the sweet air that's gladdened by the sun,"" must spend eternity stuck below the dark, festering mud of Styx.  Virgil and Dante continue their trek around the river until they come to the base of a tower. 
	Inferno section 8: Dante and Virgil spy two flames in the distance as they near the tower.  These flames signal the approach of Phlegyas, the oarsman who takes the poets across the river.  As the three cross Styx, a shade rises from the mud and tries to attack Dante.  At first Dante does not recognize the shade but when he finally realizes that the spirit is that of Filippo Argenti, Dante curses the shade and sends him flailing back into the water.  Virgil praises Dante for his actions and explains that the city of Dis lies ahead of them.  Dis stands as the entrance to the lower part of Hell, reserved for the worst violent and fraudulent sinners.  Fallen angels angrily block the path into Dis.  They refuse to speak with Dante so Virgil proceeds alone to convince the fallen angels to let them pass.
	Inferno section 9: The fallen angels refuse to let Virgil and Dante pass through the gates so Virgil returns to Dante and explains that help has been promised to them so they must wait for that help to arrive.  Frightened by their situation, Dante tries to gather courage by asking Virgil about other mortals who had taken the journey through Hell.  Virgil reveals that he himself was sent to summon a spirit in a Circle far below the one in which they now stand.  Dante has little time to comfort himself as three bloody and terrifying Furies appear before the poets.  Their heads covered in snakes, the Furies, Erinyes, Megaera, and Allecto summon Medusa to turn Dante into stone.  Dante and Virgil cover Dante's eyes but do not cower long because a great noise announces the arrival of a spirit who crosses Styx without touching the water.  The heavenly messenger arrives at the gates of Dis and admonishes the fallen angels for not allowing the poets passage.  The messenger opens the gates and abruptly turns to leave.  Dante and Virgil enter Dis and see a field covered with flaming sepulchers.  Dante hears mournful cries emanating from the coffins and Virgil explains that the cries belong to the arch-heretics whose tombs lie here.
	Inferno section 10: Dante asks to speak to one of the spirits lying in its tomb.  Virgil allows him to speak to Farinata, a former Ghibelline who fought against Dante's ancestors.  A spirit in a nearby tomb interrupts Dante's conversation with Farinata to inquire about his son, Guido.  Dante uses the past tense to describe Guido so, thinking his son is dead, the shade crashes back into his tomb before Dante can finish his sentence.  Farinata resumes his discussion with Dante, telling him that he will have difficulty returning to Florence from his exile and asking him why their two political parties hate each other so much.  In turn, Dante asks Farinata to explain why spirits can see into the past and into the future but they cannot see the present.  Farinata explains, ""We see, even as men who are farsighted, those things.that are remote from us; the Highest Lord allots us that much light.  But when events draw near or are, our minds are useless; were we not informed by others, we should know nothing of our human state."" As Dante moves away, he asks Farinata to tell Guido's father that his son is not dead.  Hearing Virgil call, Dante returns to his master and the two poets move into a new, accursed valley.

Divine Comedy: Novel Summary: Inferno section 11- Inferno section 15,"Inferno section 11: Still in the Sixth Circle, Dante and Virgil pause behind the tomb of Pope Anastasius to acclimate to the vile stench that now surrounds them.  To pass the time, Virgil instructs Dante on what lies ahead.  Virgil explains that the next Circle (Seven) holds sinners who were violent against their neighbors, against themselves, and against God and Nature.  Sinners who committed ten different types of ""ordinary"" fraud live in Circle Eight while traitors who committed treacherous fraud-against kindred, country, guests, and masters-live in Circle Nine closest to Satan.  Dante wonders why the sinners guilty of incontinence (Circles Two through Five) live outside the walls of Dis.  Virgil reminds Dante of Aristotle's Ethicsin which the author explains why incontinence is less offensive to God than fraud because people commit acts of incontinence without malice.  The poets' discussion then moves to the subject of usury. When a man tries to evade the labors necessary to live by nature and by his own art, he commits usury, an act that violates God's plan.  Virgil closes the discussion by asking Dante to follow him down the cliff into the next Circle.
	Inferno section 12: Upon descending the rocky cliff, Dante and Virgil come to an opening that is guarded by the Minotaur.  In a great rage, the Minotaur can do nothing to stop this journey.  The poets descend through the opening quickly.  As they climb down, Virgil instructs Dante to look below to view the river of boiling blood where the violent sinners live.  Dante sees that centaurs stand at the banks of this river, launching arrows at the shades in the river who act out of order.  The centaurs spy the poets and send three of their own-Nessus, Chiron, and Pholus-to meet them. Chiron speaks first, noting that the rocks move under Dante's feet indicating that Dante is still alive.  Chiron sends Nessus to carry Dante across the river of blood.  As they glide across the river, Nessus explains that the sinners sunk deepest were tyrants and murderers on Earth.  Once they reach the ford over the river, Nessus leaves Dante and explains that the river grows deeper on the other side of the ford where major tyrants like Attila reside.
	Inferno section 13: Still in the Seventh Circle, Dante and Virgil enter a dark and foreboding forest.  Dante notices that the trees in this wood have strange black leaves on misshapen branches and poison sticks rather than fruit.  Harpies nest in the barren branches.  Virgil explains that this second round of the Seventh Circle houses people who committed suicide.  For their punishment, these sinners have been turned into trees.  Pulling a branch from one of the trees, Dante is surprised when the tree-spirit responds in agony from the pain of losing its branch.  Dante feels pity for the spirit and asks it to tell its story.  The spirit belongs to the man who served as a faithful aid to Fredrick II.  But when Fredrick turned against him he could not stand to be out of his master's favor so he killed himself.  Virgil asks the spirit to explain how the suicides become trees.  The sad shade describes that when a soul is ripped from its body by suicide it is sent to this Circle by Minos where it sprouts roots and grows from the fetid soil.  The trees then spend eternity feeling horrible pain as Harpies eat their leaves.  As the tree-spirit finishes its story, the poets hear a great rumble thundering through the forest.  Chased by black bitches as fast as greyhounds, two spirits belonging to Lano and Jacopo da Santo Andrea seek cover behind a spirit-bush to no avail.  The dogs easily catch the spirits and tear it to shreds.
	Inferno section 14: Dante and Virgil move into the last round of the Seventh Circle where those who were violent against God (blasphemers) spend eternity.  A vast and desolate plane sprawls before the poets as they behold numerous souls lying, crouching, and wandering across the desert.  The desert floor burns as flakes of fire continuously scorches the sand.  Dante turns to one spirit lying in the sand that seems undaunted by the rain of fire.  This soul, Capeneus, defied gods in ancient times and was struck down by Zeus.  Yet Capeneus still thinks of himself as unconquered and, therefore, still blasphemous despite his horrendous punishment.  Virgil admonishes the spirit and calls Dante to move on.  Dante and Virgil come to a deep red river and realize that they must use it as a path through the desert.  As they follow the river, Virgil describes the legend of a great creature that lives in the island of Crete.  From this creature flow the tears that collect in Hell and form the great rivers: Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon.  The river that they now follow will lead them to Cocytus (Satan) at the very bottom of Hell.  In response to Virgil's description, Dante asks, ""But if the rivulet must follow such a course down from our world, why can we see it only at this boundary?"" Virgil replies that as they have descended into Hell (which is shaped like a circular cone) they have traveled to the left and have not yet made a complete circle.
	Inferno section 15: Still walking along the river in the Seventh Circle, Dante enters the area of Hell reserved for those who were violent against God-the Sodomites.  As the poets walk across the burning plain, a group of shades approaches them.  Dante recognizes one of the spirits as that belonging to Ser Brunetto.  After Dante explains how Virgil found him and brought him to Hell, Brunetto prophesies Dante's fame and gives him details of his exile.  Brunetto was one of Dante's mentors in life so upon meeting him in Hell, Dante feels sorrowful and speaks to his friend with kindness and gratitude.  As they conclude their conversation, Dante asks Brunetto who else dwells in this part of Hell.  Brunetto mentions a few, all-renowned scholars who were guilty of sodomy (although Brunetto does not identify this crime by name).  Another group of spirits approaches Dante and Brunetto.  Brunetto runs off because he is not allowed to be with those spirits.

Inferno section 16: Dante and Virgil approach a waterfall cascading into the lower regions of Hell.  As they approach the falls, three spirits leave a group of spirits because they recognize Dante's garb as Florentine.  The three spirits belong to Guido Guerra, Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, and Jacopo Rusticucci-all notable patriarchs of Florence who belonged to Dante's political party.  The spirits wish Dante much fame and ask if Florence has changed.  Dante responds with regret, ""Newcomers to the city and quick gains have brought excess and arrogance to you, o Florence, and you weep for it already!"" As they retreat, the spirits ask Dante to speak of them when he returns to Earth.  Dante and Virgil make their way to the waterfall.  Virgil asks Dante to give him the coil wrapped around his waist.  Virgil tosses the coil into the waterfall to signal the beast that will carry Dante into the depths below.
	Inferno section 17: ""Behold the beast who bears the pointed tail, who crosses mountains, shatters weapons, walls! Behold the one whose stench fills all the world!"" Dante announces as Geryon, the monster summoned by Virgil to escort Dante past the waterfall, appears.  Dante describes Geryon in vivid terms: the face of an old man with gracious features, the trunk and tail of a serpent, two paws, and hair up to his armpits.  Virgil instructs Dante to talk to a group of spirits sitting by the waterfall while he convinces Geryon to be their escort.  Dante pauses to talk to the spirits who occupy a separate zone of the Seventh Circle, set aside for those who were violent against Nature and Art (Usurers).  The Usurers also suffer from the flakes of falling fire but the also wear pouches around their necks.  On each pouch sits a different crest.  These crests are the only things that differentiate one spirit from another because their faces are indistinguishable.  The Usureers do not treat Dante kindly.  One spirit sticks out its tongue at Dante who retreats quickly to rejoin Virgil.  Dante mounts Geryon who takes him on a terrifying flight to the landing below.  Upon setting the poet down, Geryon flies away like an arrow.
	Inferno section 18: ""There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, made all of stone the color of crude iron, as is the wall that makes its way around it."" Thus, begins Dante's journey through the lower regions of Hell.  Malebolge means ""evil pouches."" Ten pouches, aligned in concentric circles, make up the Eighth Circle where ""ordinary fraud"" is punished.  Dante and Virgil first see a deep valley where sinners who were panderers or seducers walk constantly in both directions as horned demons flog and torment them.  Dante recognizes one sinner and calls him by name, Caccianemico.  This sinner tells of how he arranged for the seduction of his own sister.  Dante and Virgil continue across the first chasm and come to the second chasm where flatterers are sunk in excrement.  Dante recognizes Allessio Interminei who explains that he is sunk to the top of his head because in life he could never stop his flattery.  Upon seeing the woman, Thais, who flattered her lover extravagantly, the poets move away into the next area of Malebolge.
	Inferno section 19: The third chasm of the Eighth Circle holds the Simonists, clergy members who trade the favor of the church for money.  Deeply opposed to papal interference in public life, Dante takes this opportunity in the book to rail against these sinners.  The Simonists must spend eternity upside down in holes.  Protruding from holes, the legs and feet of these shades burn with flames.  Dante sees one spirit suffering from more pain than the others.  He approaches the spirit to find that it belongs to a pope (Nicholas III).  Dante reproves Nicholas by recounting the story of Jesus and Peter who asked for no money when they chose Matthias to take the place of Judas.  Virgil, pleased by Dante's tirade against the pope, carries Dante across this chasm to a bridge above the next valley.
	Inferno section 20: In the fourth pouch of the Eighth Circle, Dante finds the Diviners, Astrologers, and Magicians who all tried to foretell the future-a sin against God's plan.  With their heads placed backwards on their bodies, these shades must spend eternity walking backwards.  Dante meets Manto, the sorceress who founded the city of Mantua, Virgil's birthplace.  Manto tells the long story of the founding of Mantua.  Virgil points out other shades in this realm: Eurypylus, Michael Scott, a writer of occult sciences, Guido Bonati, Asdente, and numerous women who became women.  Virgil hurries Dante as the moon sets.

Inferno section 21: Virgil and Dante come to the center of the bridge that crosses the fifth pouch of the Eighth Circle where they find the Barrators-those who profited from their positions in public office-mired in a river of boiling pitch.  Malebranche (Evil Claws) demons approach the poets with a new spirit from the city of Lucca who they throw into the chasm below.  Virgil tells Dante to hide from the demons while he secures their guidance across the river.  The demons start to attack Virgil but he holds them off by asking to talk to one of them.  Malacoda (Evil Tail) steps forward to ask Virgil why he wishes to speak to them.  Virgil explains that the demons cannot hurt Dante because their journey was willed in Heaven.  Malacoda orders the other demons not to attack and instead calls ten of his sidekicks forward to escort the poets to the next chasm while they prod and torment the sinners in the pitch to ensure that they do not escape.  The rebellious demons taunt Dante but do as they are told.  The group proceeds to the next pouch.
	Inferno section 22: As the noisy party marches up the river, Dante's attention turns to the sinners in the pitch.  He notices that most of the sinners stay submerged but some leap out like dolphins while others sit like frogs with only their heads breaking the surface of the sludge.  As the demons approach, all but one sinner dives beneath the surface.  The demon Graffiacane hooks the remaining sinner and drags him to shore.  The demons flog and claw the shade.  Dante asks to know the name of this unfortunate soul.  The hapless shade replies that he was from Navarre and served King Thibaut.  He reports to Dante that he used his position to sell political favors and now must suffer the consequences in Hell.  As the demons attack the Barrator from Navarre, Dante asks if any Latian sinners reside here.  The tormented shade replies that both Friar Gomita of Gallura and Don Michel Zanche from Sardinia lie below.  Continuing to claw and jab at the spirit, the wild demons begin to quarrel amongst themselves.  The shade from Navarre seizes his opportunity to escape by diving back into the pitch.  Furious, two demons fly after him.  One demon pulls up just as it reaches the surface of the pitch.  Angry with his compatriot for missing the shade, the other demon attacks his colleague and the two battle like birds of prey in midair.  As the demons fight they too fall into the pitch and cannot fly.  Dante and Virgil walk quietly away from the chaotic scene. 
	Inferno section 23: Dante feels uneasy as he and Virgil leave the demons.  He fears that the demons will blame them for their fight and pursue them as a hawk would pursue a mouse.  In fact, the demons are chasing them so Virgil quickly scoops Dante into his arms and descends down to the sixth pouch.  The demons cannot leave their realm so they watch helplessly from above as their prey escapes.  In the sixth pouch, Dante and Virgil find spirits walking very slowly.  Cloaked in hoods and garments that appear dazzling but are lined with lead, these shades-the Hypocrites-must spend eternity bearing these deceptively beautiful instruments of torture.  Dante crosses paths with spirits who belonged to Jovial Firars, men who were supposed to govern Florence.  The Friars discuss the rationale behind some of the punishments bestowed upon their brethren.  Virgil asks where they will find a bridge to cross this chasm.  The Friars respond that all the bridges were destroyed at the same time.  Realizing that Malacoda had lied to him about the bridges, Virgil storms angrily away.
	Inferno section 24: Somewhat stunned by Virgil's anger, Dante follows his master downcast and wary.  Virgil puts his pupil at ease, though, when he turns to him wearing a calm and benign expression.  Virgil finds a place where they can climb out of this chasm.  Since he is weightless, Virgil pushes Dante from behind as he struggles up the rocky and treacherous cliff.  When they reach the top, Dante falls to the ground in exhaustion.  Virgil implores him to keep moving so the two travelers continue to the next chasm-seventh pouch.  This new chasm holds the Thieves who must spend eternity running naked through the darkness as serpents chase them.  Dante spies a gruesome sight: thrust through the loins of a shade, the head and tail of a serpent clasp in a knot about the body of the shade while the rest of the serpent's body coils around the shade's hands behind its back.  Another serpent sinks its fangs into the neck of the shade that then turns to ashes, only to take shape again and repeat its misery.  Dante finds that this spirit belongs to Vanni Fucci of Pistoia, a man who robbed the sacristy of a church.  Vanni prophesies that Dante's White party will lose a battle at Pistoia.
	Inferno section 25: Vanni Fucci curses God and makes an obscene gesture.  To silence him, a serpent wraps itself around Vanni's neck and Dante believes that the sinner has gotten what he deserves.  Chased by a horrible monster, Vanni runs away.  Virgil identifies the monster as Cacus, the creature that was killed by Hercules for stealing his cattle.  Five Florentine Thieves approach Dante-three of them humans and two of them serpents.  Of the encounter, Dante writes, ""As I kept my eyes fixed on those sinners, a serpent with six feet springs out against one of the three, and clutches him completely.  It gripped his belly with its middle feet, and with its forefeet grappled his two arms; and then sank its teeth in both his cheeks.Then just as if their substance were warm wax, they stuck together and they mixed their colors, so neither seemed what he had been before; just as, when paper's kindled, where it still has not caught flame in full, its color's dark though not yet black, while white is dying off."" Dante vividly describes this metamorphosis as snake and human become one being and then trade forms.  He goes on to describe other similar scenes including that of a reptile creating smoke by biting one of the human spirits.

Inferno section 26: Still in the seventh pouch of the Eighth Circle, Dante opens here with an invective against Florence, ""Be joyous, Florence, you are great indeed, for over sea and land you beat your wings; through every part of Hell your name extends!"" The travelers now move to the eighth pouch where the evil counselors dwell.  Numerous flames spread across the darkness like fireflies.  Virgil explains that these flames hold the spirits of the sinners.  Dante sees a divided flame and asks Virgil to whom this fire belongs.  Virgil explains that Ulysses and Diomede share this flame because together they plotted the invasion of the Trojan horse and they also separated Achilles from Deidamia, who died of a broken heart.  Dante approaches Ulysses who eagerly recalls the dramatic story of his death at sea. 
	Inferno section 27: A flame near the flame of Ulysses tries to speak in unintelligible tones.  Finally, once it has controlled itself, the flame asks to speak politely and wonders if anyone knows whether there is war or peace in his former Latian land.  A Latian himself, Dante jumps into a discourse about the past and present situation in the cities that make up his home region: Ravenna, Romagna, Cervia, Forli, Montagna, and Cesena.  According to Dante, most of these cities are misruled.  Dante asks for the name of the spirit who eagerly reveals that he was a soldier who became a brother of the order of St. Francis.  St. Bonafice asked the spirit, Guido da Montefeltro, to devise a plan to make war against other Christians and absolved Guido for this sin in advance.  The war plan was successful but when Guido died a demon claimed his soul because the absolution made by Bonafice was not valid.  Guido ends his story and moves away as the poets advance to the next bridge.
	Inferno section 28: Here in the ninth pouch of the Eighth Circle dwell the Sowers of Scandal and Schism.  Dante warns his readers of the gruesome details that are to follow.  As the poets cross this chasm, they first cross paths with Mohammed.  Mohammed, disemboweled, speaks of his successor, Ali, who is likewise mangled and circling the chasm for eternity.  Mohammed explains that when their wounds heal, a demon wounds them with a sword again and the process starts again.  As Dante and Mohammed talk, a large group of spirits crowds around to listen.  Mohammed asks Dante to tell one of his living brethren, Fra Dolcino, to supply himself with food so that the Novarese will not be victorious when the winter snows fall.  A different spirit to carry the message to Messer Guido and Angiolello that they will be drowned at sea.  Yet another shade, whose hands are cut off, enters the discussion.  This spirit belongs to Mosca, a leader whose bad counsel began the rivalry between the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Florence.  Dante speaks harshly to Mosca who, pained by Dante's comments, sulks away.  Finally, a headless sinner approaches the group.  This spirit belongs to Bertrand de Born, an evil counselor whose scandal caused a father and son to become enemies.  He must now spend eternity pacing the depths of Hell with his brain, that which created the plot, severed from his body.
	Inferno section 29: Dante weeps sorrowfully as he leaves the Sowers of Scandal behind.  He laments that he had been looking for an ancestor of his whose murder had not yet been avenged.  Virgil reveals that he saw Dante's ancestor, Geri del Bello, crouching under a bridge while Dante spoke to the group of shades.  Geri, Virgil explains, was so angry about the fact that his death has not been avenged that he refused to speak.  Dante still feels sorry for his ancestor but continues to the ninth pouch.  At the bridge over this chasm, Dante hears tremendous wails and smells a stench that reminds him of rotting human limbs.  Dante and Virgil move to a spot where they can better view the resting place of the Falsifiers.  Most of these sinners lie in a grotesque and diseased heap while others crawl about aimlessly.  Dante notices two shades furiously scratching scabs off one another as if they were both scaling fish.  Dante asks the shades for their names and their stories.  The first spirit identifies himself as an alchemist from Arezzo.  Minos sent him to this Circle because alchemy is a form of falsifying.  The second spirit proudly identifies himself as Capocchio, another famous alchemist.
	Inferno section 30: Dante opens this canto with a recount of ancient Greeks who had gone insane as a preface to the following scene: ""But neither fury-Theban, Trojan-ever was seen to be so cruel against another, in rending beasts and even human limbs, as were two shades I saw, both pale and naked, who, biting, ran berserk in just the way a hod does when it's let loose in its sty.  The one came at Capocchio and sank his tusks into his neck so that, by dragging, he made the hard ground scrape against his belly."" The remaining shade from Arezzo explains that the two shades that attack Capocchio belong to Gianni Schicchi and Myrrha.  Schicchi and Myrrha reside in the part of Hell reserved for Counterfeiters of Other Persons (another type of falsifying) because they both pretended to be other people.  After all of these shades retreat, Dante looks around at other miserable souls.  He sees the soul belonging to Master Adam, swollen with dropsy.  Master Adam was a counterfeiter of coins in Florence.  Dante asks Adam for the names of other sinners nearby.  As Adam begins to reveal the names of those around him, one of the shades, insulted by the conversation, attacks Adam.  The two start to quarrel while Dante listens quietly.  Virgil admonishes Dante for listening to the fight and urges him onward.

Inferno section 31: As Virgil and Dante climb to the crest of the next chasm, the Ninth Circle, they hear a thunderous horn.  Dante looks in the direction of the sound and sees huge towers in the distance.  Taking Dante by the hand, Virgil explains that the towers that he sees are actually the silhouettes of giants mired in mud.  As the poets approach, Dante gets a better view of the entrance into the final pit. The giants, anomalies of Nature, encircle the pit like a turret.  As Dante describes these monstrosities, one of them begins to yell gibberish.  Virgil tells the giant that he is stupid because he must use the horn that hangs around his neck to vent his frustration.  This giant, Virgil explains, is Nimrod, the builder of the Tower of Babel.  Dante and Virgil approach the next giant, Ephialtes, who is wrapped with a chain.  Dante wishes to see the giant Briareus but Virgil explains that he too is tied with chains, so the poets will only see Antaeus who can set them on the bottom of the pit because he is not tied in chains.  Virgil greets Antaeus by recalling all of the giant's deeds on Earth.  He tells Antaeus that Dante will bring him great fame if he helps the poet descend.  The giant gingerly stoops to lift Dante then sets him down in the pit where Judas and Satan live.
	Inferno section 32: Dante and Virgil emerge in the Ninth (and final) Circle of Hell.  Before them lies a frozen wasteland that defies description.  Dante invokes the Muses to help him find the language to speak the truth about this abyss.  The poets begin to move through the first ring, Caina, where Traitors to their Kin are immersed in ice.  A voice warns Dante not to step on the spirits who are sunk to their chin in the crystal clear ice.  Dante looks down at his feet and sees two brothers immersed together.  As the brothers weep, their tears freeze, binding them closer together.  Dante continues on his journey and accidentally kicks the face of a frozen spirit.  This spirit wails in pain and sorrow and demands to know how Dante can walk through Antenora, the second circle, kicking shades.  Antenora holds the Traitors to their Homeland or their Party so Dante wants to know the name of the shade with which he now speaks.  The shade refuses to give its name so Dante begins to pull at the spirit's hair.  The two tussle until another spirit reveals that the feisty shade belongs to Bocca.  Angrily, Bocca starts to name other traitors confined to Antenora as Dante moves away.  On his way past these traitors, Dante notices a spirit feeding on the head and neck of another sinner lying nearby.
	Inferno section 33: Dante tells the carnivorous shade that he will bring it fame on Earth if it reveals its story to him.  Weeping, the shade replies that it will gladly tell its story because in doing so it will reveal the name of the shade upon which it feeds.  The first spirit belongs to Count Ugolino while the second one belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri.  Ruggieri captured Ugolino and put him to death.  Dante already knew that Ruggieri had killed Ugolino but he was not aware of the cruel details of Ugolino's death.  Ugolino recounts that he when he awoke in prison he heard his sons asking for food.  Rather than bringing the men food, Ruggieri's henchmen nailed the doors of the prison shut and let all five die of starvation.  One by one, Ugolino heard his sons die then he himself died from hunger.  The story saddens Dante because although Ugolino betrayed the locations of strongholds in Pisa, his sons had done nothing wrong and did not deserve to die in such a tormented manner. 
	Dante and Virgil move to the third ring (Ptolomaea) where Traitors against Their Guests jut out of the ice, their eyes frozen shut by their tears.  One of the shades calls to Dante to take the ice from its eyelids.  Dante agrees to do so if the shade reveals its name.  The spirit agrees and states that it belongs to Friar Alberigo, a man who murdered his younger brother.  Dante did not know that this man was already dead.  He believes that his spirit must have descended into Hell while a demon occupies Alberigo's body on Earth.  Dante finds his hypothesis to be true when he notices the spirit belonging to Branca d'Oria resting nearby.  Alberigo implores Dante to remove the ice from his eyes as he had promised.  Dante refuses, believing rudeness to be a grace in Hell.  Instead, Dante curses the Genoese because the body of one of their countrymen currently walks the Earth inhabited by a demon.
	Inferno section 34: Virgil and Dante finally arrive at the fourth ring of the Ninth Circle (Judecca) where the Traitors against their Benefactors lie fully covered in ice.  Carefully stepping across the encased spirits, Dante emerges from the wind and mist in full view of Satan (Dis).  Frozen up to his breast in the ice of Cocytus, Satan stands larger and more ominous than any creature Dante could imagine.  His arms are greater than the height of one of the giants that they had just passed and three gigantic pairs of wings fanning the wind that freezes the pit.  Satan has three heads-red, black, and yellow-and from his six eyes streams continuous tears.  In each of its mouths, Satan gnaws on the worst of the traitors: Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.  Virgil abruptly tells Dante that they must leave.  Virgil pulls his pupil onto his back and begins to climb down Satan's hairy body.  Virgil continues to climb until they come to a point where Satan's legs stand upright in a dark cave.  Virgil explains that when they climbed down Satan's side, they passed the center of the center of the earth so that they now stand just below the Southern Hemisphere.  Satan stands where he was planted when he originally fell from Heaven.  Dante quickly scrambles to climb back to Earth and as he does he sees stars above him for the first time since his journey began.
	Purgatorio section 1: ""To course across more kindly waters now my talent's little vessel lifts her sails, leaving behind herself a sea so cruel; and what I sing will be that second kingdom, in which the human soul is cleansed of sin becoming worthy of ascent to Heaven."" Thus, Dante opens his journey into Purgatory where he will use kinder words to describe the ascent.  To prepare himself, Dante calls upon the Muses including Calliope, the Muse of poetry.  Dante and Virgil arrive at the island where the Mountain of Purgatory stands on Easter morning.  Dante notices a constellation of four stars that have not been seen by humans since Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden.  The guardian of the region, Cato, emerges and demands to know how Dante escaped Hell.  Virgil explains that a lady in Heaven asked him to save Dante's soul before it is lost by guiding Dante through Hell.  Virgil was also directed to show Dante how the souls under Cato's charge are purged and prepared for Heaven.  Cato consents to the journey and allows the poets to pass.  Before they can pass, however, Dante must wash the dirt from Hell off of his face and he must pluck a rush from the shore to gird himself.  After Dante performs these rituals, the poets set off to find the path up the Mountain.

Purgatorio section 2: As the sun rises on Purgatory, Dante spies a ship sailing across the sea toward the island at a great rate.  Virgil instructs Dante to kneel and fold his hands because it is an angel that guides the boat and propels it with its wings.  The brightness of the angel's face blinds Dante.  As the ship approaches, Dante hears the voices of hundreds of spirits aboard the boat singing a psalm.  When the spirits land on the island they ask Dante and Virgil for directions to the path.  Virgil explains that they too are new arrivals and the spirits realize that Dante is still alive because they can see him breathing.  Meanwhile, a spirit, Casella, recognizes Dante.  Dante tries to embrace Casella three times but because she is a spirit, she has no mass and Dante's arms close around air.  Casella put some of Dante's poems to music so Dante asks her to sing a song for him.  The other spirits gather around to listen to the sweet song but Cato ends the diversion by reminding everyone that their mission to climb the mountain is urgent.  The spirits disperse and begin their journey.
	Purgatorio section 3: When the travelers enter Ante-Purgatory Dante suffers a moment of fear when he notices that he is the only one who casts a shadow.  Virgil explains that he casts a shadow because he is alive.  Many great thinkers have tried to understand why spirits can be seen but do not have mass or cast shadows.  Virgil explains that this phenomenon is one of God's mysteries and is beyond human comprehension.  Virgil then explains the same phenomenon to a group of approaching spirits that are shocked to see Dante's shadow.  One of the spirits in the group approaches Dante.  This spirit belongs to Manfred, the illegitimate son of Fredrick II.  Manfred begs Dante to tell his daughter that he repented before he died and that he regrets that his body did not get a proper burial.  Manfred explains to Dante that even people who repent at the last minute are granted salvation but they must stay in Purgatory thirty times as long as the length of their rebellion against the Church.  Manfred hopes that his daughter's prayers will take some time off of his stay in Purgatory.
	Purgatorio section 4: Dante's conversation with Manfred has made Dante lose track of time.  He uses this incident to contradict the notion of the plurality of souls doctrine.  Virgil and Dante come to a cleft in the rocks where they begin their climb toward the summit.  Dante finds the climb through the First Spur, where the Late-Repentant due to negligence dwell, extremely difficult and must stop at a ledge to rest.  While they rest, Dante notices that although they face the sun, the sun appears on his left.  Virgil explains that Purgatory stands on the opposite hemisphere from Jerusalem and since scientists believed that the world only had one hemisphere, this geography made perfect sense to Dante.  As the two begin their ascent once again, Virgil comforts Dante by telling him that the climb will become increasingly easier as they approach the summit.  As they climb, Dante encounters one of his friends, Belaqua, whose sarcastic taunting prompts Dante to tell his friend that he will no longer grieve for him.  Virgil urges his pupil to hurry on.
	Purgatorio section 5: Dante and Virgil move to the Second Spur where the Late-Repentant who died by violence spend their time in Purgatory.  As they walk, a large group of spirits approach them singing a psalm.  Once they realize that Dante is alive they beg him to send news to their loved ones on Earth.  These spirits did not receive the sacrament because they died by violence so prayers from their friends and families will make their time in Purgatory shorter.  Various spirits from this group including Jacopo del Cassero and Buonconte da Montefeltro tell their tales of death in battle.  Buonconte reveals that an angel and a demon fought over his soul after he died but the angel finally took possession of him because of a little tear that appeared in his eye.  Finally, the spirit belonging to La Pia, a lady from Siena, asks Dante to remember her when he returns to Earth.
	Purgatorio section 6: Dante compares his situation in Purgatory to that of a gambler who has won: ""When dicing's done and players separate, the loser's left alone, disconsolate-rehearsing what he'd thrown, he sadly learns; all of the crowd surrounds the one who won-one goes in front, and one tugs at his back, and at his side one asks to be remembered."" Nearly every spirit that he meets urges Dante to ask for prayers on its behalf.  Virgil once wrote that prayers from loved ones do not help souls in Purgatory.  Dante questions him on this opinion and Virgil explains that the passage that he wrote referred to a pagan who would not be helped by prayers; Christians do, however, leave Purgatory earlier when God's heard prayers on their behalf.  Virgil also admits, though, that Beatrice will give him the final answers to all of his questions so Dante is eager to continue their journey.  Virgil and Dante encounter a spirit named Sordello from Mantua along their path.  Virgil, who is also a Mantuan, embraces Sordello.  Dante uses this opportunity to illustrate how people from the same city used to stay connected while people today act like strangers to each other.  Dante delivers a scorching invective against the people of Italy then he turns his anger to the Florentines who, he believes, have become especially bad neighbors.

Purgatorio section 7: The scene returns to Virgil and Sordello, fellow Mantuans.  Sordello asks Virgil to identify himself.  Struck with awe that he has encountered the great poet, Sordello bows down and exclaims that Virgil has brought great honor to the city of Mantua.  Sordello wonders where Virgil now lives.  Virgil explains that he dwells with other virtuous pagans who practiced the cardinal virtues but did not practice the three holy virtues.  Finally, Virgil once again asks Sordello for directions up the mountain.  Sordello leads the travelers to a beautiful valley filled with sweet flowers.  Sordello points out some of the notable figures that dwell in this valley: Henry of Navarre, Peter III of Aragon, and Charles I of Anjou.  These shades give the valley its name, Valley of the Rulers.  The spirits are consigned to this spot because they too neglected to repent.  Dante uses this example to show that one's character is not necessarily noble even when one comes from a noble line of birth-an issue hotly debated during Dante's time.
	Purgatorio section 8: Darkness falls on the Valley of the Rulers.  The spirits begin to sing an evening devotion, ""Te lucis ante."" Two angels take posts in the Valley to stand guard for the night.  Although Dante cannot see their faces because they are so bright, he sees that the angels hold flaming swords and that their wings are green.  Dante and Virgil take spots among the spirits for the night.  One spirit, Nino Visconti, recognizes Dante and begs him to ask his daughter to pray for him because his wife no longer cares about him.  Dante notices that three twinkling stars overhead have replaced the constellation of four that he had seen at dawn.  Sordello spots a serpent snaking through the grass but the sound of angels wings, like those of a falcon, scare the serpent away.  Visconti's companion, Conrad Malaspina asks Dante for news from his native land, Val di Magra.  Although Dante has never been to this place, he has heard of it because its rulers are well known.  Conrad prophesies that Dante will visit Val di Magra before ""the sun [has] rested seven times.""
	Purgatorio section 9: As Dante sleeps in the Valley of the Rulers, he dreams of an eagle plucking him from Mount Ida.  He and the eagle soar toward the sun and as they catch fire, Dante awakens from his dream.  Virgil comforts his startled friend by explaining that while he slept St. Lucia carried him up the steep mountain to the gates of Purgatory (until now they had been in Ante-Purgatory).  An angel bearing a sword guards the gates of Purgatory.  Once the angel hears that Dante travels by divine design, he bids the poet to him.  Dante climbs three gleaming stairs: white marble, dark purple, blood-red porphyry.  The angel marks seven P's with his sword on Dante's forehead.  Each P represents a level of Purgatory and will be removed as Dante passes each level.  The angel opens the gates of Purgatory with a silver and a gold key and warns the poets to never look back.  As they enter, Dante hears beautiful voices singing "" Te Deum laudamus.""
	Purgatorio section 10: Dante and Virgil make a difficult climb up a zigzag path to the First Terrace where the Prideful dwell.  Beautiful carvings of scenes depicting acts of humility adorn the marble cliff adjacent to the First Terrace.  The scenes include: the Annunciation, King David dancing before the Ark, and a woman begging Emperor Trajan to avenge her son's death.  A sorrowful group of spirits approaches the poets.  Hunched low to the ground by huge rocks slung about their shoulders, these spirits must contemplate their pride until they have served their appropriate penance.  Dante berates these souls by saying, ""O Christians, arrogant, exhausted, wretched, whose intellects are sick and cannot see, who place your confidence in backward steps, do you not know that we are worms and born to form the angelic butterfly that soars, without defenses, to confront His judgment?""
	Purgatorio section 11: The Prideful spirits recite a long version of the Lord's Prayer.  Moved by their sincere solemnity, Dante believes that the living ought to help these spirits with their prayers.  Virgil asks for directions and one shade, Omberto Aldobrandeschi, responds.  Omberto describes how his unwarranted pride of ancestry caused the downfall of his kinsman and his own death.  Another spirit, belonging to the artist Oderisi of Gubbio, explains how the pride he took in his talents landed him on this Terrace in Purgatory.  Oderisi claims that artists such as him should not strive for fame because their fame is so transient-as an example, he notes how Giotto surpassed Cimabue.  Oderisi identifies one of his companions, the leader Salvani from Siena.  Surprised to see that Salvani bypassed a lengthy stay in Ante-Purgatory, Dante asks how Salvani came to the Terrace so quickly.  Oderisi explains that Salvani performed a momentous act of humility at the height of his power when he begged in the streets to get money for the ransom of a friend.  Salvani's quick ascent into Purgatory shows that great acts of humility can mitigate late repentance.

Purgatorio section 12: Still on the First Terrace, Virgil urges Dante to hurry because he has been keeping pace with Oderisi who walks stooped low to the ground.  Virgil also points out the scenes of pride carved into the ground so that the stooped spirits will contemplate the consequences of pride as they walk.  The first scene depicts Satan's fall from Heaven.  Twelve scenes alternating between Biblical and classical mythology follow: Briareus, the Giants, Nimrod, Niobe, Saul, Arachne, Rehoboam, Eriphyle, Sennacherib, Cyrus, Holofernes, and Troy.  As Dante and Virgil begin their ascent from the First Terrace, an angel brushes Dante's forehead with its wing.  Dante finds the climb out of the Terrace easy and Virgil tells him that because the angel erased one of the P's from Dante's brow, the climb has become easier.  Dante compares the stairway that he and Virgil now mount with the stairway that leads to the church of San Miniato on the hilltop overlooking Florence.
	Purgatorio section 13: Dante and Virgil emerge on the Second Terrace where the Envious serve their penance in Purgatory.  Although the ledge seems deserted, Dante hears voices singing the praises of fraternal love-the opposite of envy.  The first voice sings ""Vinum non habent"" (the words of Mary's appeal to Christ when the wine ran out at the wedding feast in Cana).  The second voice: ""I am Orestes"" (the words Pylades said to pretend to be his friend so that he, rather than the real Orestes, would be killed).  The third voice: ""Love those by whom you have been hurt."" Virgil directs Dante's attention to a group of spirits seated against the wall.  Nearly indistinguishable from the rock, these spirits wear haircloth cloaks that are the same color as the rocks and lean against each other like beggars.  Envious souls, these shades spend their time in Purgatory weeping because their eyes are sewn shut.  Dante meets Sapia, a woman from Siena who took pleasure in the misfortunes of others.  Sapia tells her story and asks Dante to pray for her when he returns to Earth.
	Purgatorio section 14: Curious about his conversation with Sapia, two other spirits, Guido del Duca and Rinieri da Calboli, approach Dante and ask him who he is and where he is from.  Dante responds that he is from a town on the banks of the river that begins in Mount Falterona.  Guido realizes that Dante speaks of the river Arno and that Dante hasn't mentioned it by name because he is ashamed of his hometown.  The shade responds by delivering a blistering speech against the people that live along the Arno.  Guido compares the people from the upper regions of the Arno to the lower regions as follows: hogs, curs, dogs, and wolves.  Guido prophesies that his grandson will someday slaughter the people that live in the region of wolves.  Guido reveals that in life he was envious of anyone who appeared to be happy.  Finally, Guido laments the moral downfall of his Rinieri's descendants and the moral degradation of the Romagna region.  Moving away from these envious spirits, Dante hears voices singing examples of envy.  Virgil instructs Dante that these words should remind men of the glories of Heaven but instead Satan tempts humans to think only of life on Earth.
	Purgatorio section 15: A strong light forces Dante to cover his face.  The light, however, persists and Virgil reminds Dante that his mortal senses are powerless against the approach of an angel.  The angel arrives and directs the travelers to the next terrace where the Wrathful reside.  As the poets leave the Envious, they hear the Fifth Beatitude, ""Beati misericordes"" (Blessed are the merciful).  Dante asks Virgil to explain this remark made by Guido when they were on the last terrace: ""Sharing cannot have a part."" Virgil explains that the value of material possessions decrease with sharing while the value of spiritual possessions increases with sharing-God pours out more love to everyone as more souls love Him.  A fuller explanation, Virgil concludes, will come from Beatrice.  As they reach the next terrace, Dante experiences several ecstatic visions in which he sees examples of virtue opposite the sin of wrath.  In the first vision, Dante sees a mother treating her son gently after she finds him amidst a crowded temple.  In the second vision, Dante sees a mother beg her husband to punish a boy who has embraced their daughter.  The father calms his wife by saying, ""What shall we do to one who'd injured us if one who loves us earns our condemnation?"" In his third vision, Dante sees a crowd stoning a man and shouting ""Kill!"" As the victim falls dead to the ground he prays to God to forgive his attackers.  Dante regains consciousness after the visions and Virgil reminds him that these visions are meant to deter him from wrath.  As the travelers eagerly continue their journey, a smoky cloud emerges before them.
	Purgatorio section 16: The cloud of smoke burns Dante's eyes and irritates his skin.  Although Dante cannot see anything in the murky smoke he can hear the Wrathful souls asking for forgiveness and praying to God for peace by chanting ""Angnus Dei."" Hearing Dante and Virgil in conversation, the spirit of Marco Lombardo approaches and consents to guide the poets along this terrace.  Dante asks Marco about the cause of human corruption, ""The world indeed has been stripped utterly of every virtue; as you said to me, it cloaks-and is cloaked by-perversity.  Some place the cause in Heaven, some, below; but I beseech you to define the cause, that, seeing it, I may show it to others."" Marco responds that while some corruption can be blamed on the stars, men must take responsibility for their actions.  Men understand good and evil and have the free will to choose their path in life.  Thus, men must be held accountable for both their good and bad deeds.  Marco explains that men, born innocent and inexperienced, need guidance from their rulers through laws.  Rome once had two rulers-one that governed spiritual life while the other governed political life.  Marco blames the present state of moral decay in Italy on the fact that only one ruler governs both spheres of life.  Marco names three men who embody examples of ancient virtue: Currado da Palazzo, Gherardo, and Guido da Castello.

Purgatorio section 17: The poets emerge from the smoky cloud near sunset.  Again, Dante receives visions of wrath: Procne (who killed her son), the execution of Haman, and Lavinia (who discovered the body of her mother who had hanged herself).  After the visions pass, an angel beckons Dante to mount the stairs to the Fourth Terrace where the Slothful reside.  The angel brushes another P from Dante's forehead.  As Dante climbs the stairs he hears the Seventh Beatitude, ""Beati pacifici"" (Blessed are the peacemakers).  Night has fallen when the travelers reach the next level so the two rest.  To pass the time, Virgil outlines the design of Purgatory.  Virgil explains that all action, good and evil, stems from some form of love.  There are two forms of love, instinctual love and chosen love (love that stems from one's mind).  Natural (instinctual) love is perfect in the eyes of God but chosen love emerges from man's free will and is, therefore, prone to error.  Love that aims to hurt others takes form in pride, envy, and wrath-the sins found on the first three terraces.  Love directed toward a worthy end but with insufficient zeal, sloth, is punished on the Fourth Terrace.  The three upper terraces punish sinners who loved earthly objects excessively.  Virgil does not reveal the sins punished on the three upper terraces.
	Purgatorio section 18: Virgil continues his discussion of love and free will: ""The soul, which is created quick to love, responds to everything that pleases, just as soon as beauty wakens it to act.Then, just as flames ascend because the form of fire was fashioned to fly upward, toward the stuff of its own sphere, where it lasts longest, so does the soul, when seized, move into longing, a motion of the spirit, never resting till the beloved thing has made it joyous."" However, while instinctual love is natural, like the flames of a fire, men exert free will.  Free will can pervert natural love and men are judged by their acts of free will.  Virgil states, ""Now that all other longings may conform to this first will [instinctual love], there is in you, inborn, the power that counsels [free will], keeper of the threshold of your assent: this principle on which your merit may be judged, for it garners and winnows good and evil longings."" As Virgil concludes his explanation, the poets hear a group of spirits approach.  In great haste, the spirits recite examples of zeal (the opposite of their own sin, sloth) as they hurry by.  Virgil asks the souls for directions to the next terrace as Dante falls asleep.
	Purgatorio section 19: In a dream, Dante encounters a Siren that sings to him sweetly and tries to tempt him as she tempted Ulysses.  Virgil rips the clothes off of the Siren to expose her ugliness and corruption.  Startled, Dante awakens from his dream as an angel approaches to lead the poets to the next level.  The angel pronounces the Third Beatitude, ""Qui lugent"" ([Blessed are] those who mourn).  As they climb to the next plain, Virgil explains to Dante that the Siren caused the sins of those who reside above on the mountain.  To guard against the Siren's seductions, men must ""fasten [their] eyes upon the lure that's spun by the eternal King"" (men must keep their eyes on Heaven).  On the Fifth Terrace-reserved for the Avaricious and the Prodigal, Dante finds numerous spirits lying face down on the ground singing ""Adhesit pavimento anima mea"" (My soul has adhered to the ground).  Dante questions a nearby spirit who explains that he was avaricious (he loved earthly possessions) until he became a pope.  Since he did not turn his eyes toward Heaven until late in life, he must spend his time in Purgatory groveling for penance face down in the dirt.  Dante bows out of respect for this former pope but the spirit admonishes him to stand because in the spirit world everyone is an equal servant of God. 
	Purgatorio section 20: Dante and Virgil stay close to the wall as they move along this terrace because so many souls crowd the ground.  Dante calls avarice a ""she-wolf"" which has claimed the most souls of any sin.  Dante hears a voice citing the poverty of Mary as an example of virtue opposite avarice.  The voice continues by citing two more examples: Fabricius, a Roman counsel who rejected a bribe, and St. Nicholas, who saved his sisters from degradation by earning dowries for them.  Dante finds the spirit whose voice he just heard and learns that it belongs to Hugh Capet, the founder of a grand French dynasty.  In a long and specific list of the crimes committed by French royalty, Capet denounces the sins of his children and kinsmen and prophesies future treachery.  Capet tells Dante that the penitents on this ledge recite examples of poverty and generosity during the day and decry examples of avarice during the night.  Capet gives several examples of Avarice: Pygmalion, Midas, and Heliodorus.  As the poets leave Capet, Dante feels a tremendous earthquake.  The spirits cry ""Gloria in excelsis Deo"" then continue their recitals with more zeal than before.
	Purgatorio section 21: Still on the Fifth Terrace, Dante dwells on the source of the earthquake that he just experienced.  A spirit approaches the travelers from behind and demands to know whey Dante has come to Purgatory.  Virgil explains that their journey was designed in Heaven and that although he is consigned to Limbo, Virgil must act as Dante's guide.  In response to Dante's query about the earthquake, the spirit explains that Purgatory quakes every time a spirit completes its penance and rises to Heaven.  Each time this happens, the remaining spirits praise the Lord.  The spirit, calling himself Statius, claims that the last quake signaled his own deliverance from Purgatory.  Without recognizing Virgil standing before him, Statius remarks that his inspiration in life was the great poet.  Dante reveals the name of his guide and Statius bows down before Virgil in great reverence and awe.

Purgatorio section 22: After brushing another P from Dante's forehead, an angel directs the poets to the next level.  As they move toward the Sixth Terrace where the Gluttonous dwell, Virgil and Statius discuss the Aeneid.  Statius admits that he was so moved by this passage in Virgil's epic poem that he became prodigal: ""Why cannot you, o holy hunger for gold, restrain the appetite of mortals?"" Opposite sins, prodigality and avarice, are punished in the same circle of both Hell and Purgatory.  Virgil asks Statius how he became a Christian.  Again, Statius reveals that a passage in one of Virgil's poems that prophesized the coming of a new faith led Statius to his religion.  However, Statius kept his conversion to Christianity a secret and had to repent for his sloth as well.  Virgil names Roman and Greek poets who reside with him in Limbo: Plautus, Terrence, Antigont, and Ismene.  As the travelers reach the Sixth Terrace, Dante encounters a strange tree that bears sweet fruit and tapers at the bottom rather than the top.  Dante hears voices reciting examples of temperance: Mary, the women of ancient Rome (who only drank water), Daniel (who was granted the power to interpret dreams because he would not eat the king's meat), and John the Baptist who ate only honey and locusts when he lived in the wilderness.
	Purgatorio section 23: Still on the Sixth Terrace, the three poets hear a spirit singing ""Labia mea, Domine"" ([Open] my lips, O Lord [and my mouth will proclaim your praise]).  As the voice sings praises, Dante sees numerous pale spirits hurrying past him.  The spirits appear hollow and emaciated from hunger.  Dante meets an old friend, Forese Donati, a fellow Florentine poet, who explains that the tree and the water the feeds it purify the gluttonous sinners who must spend their time in Purgatory without food and water.  Dante asks Forese to explain how he was able to pass Ante-Purgatory so quickly.  Forese responds that the prayers of his virtuous widow helped him leave Ante-Purgatory early.  His widow, Nella, stands in stark contrast to current Florentine women who are immodest and appear in public with their breasts exposed.  Forese notices Dante's shadow and asks for an explanation.  Dante reminds his friend that he has led a reckless life and that Virgil was sent to rescue him and will be Dante's guide until he meets Beatrice.
	Purgatorio section 24: Forese points out other gluttonous penitents: a pope who loved eels cooked in wine, Ubaldino dalla Pila, Bonafazio, and Marhese, a man who was never satisfied despite his constant drinking.  One of the Gluttons, the poet Bonagiunta, asks Dante if he wrote the poem, ""Ladies who have intelligence of love"" and Dante replies that he writes about love when he is moved by love.  Bonagiunta believes that it is this inspiration that sets Dante apart from other poets.  With the exception of Forese, the spirits that have gathered around the poets disperse.  Dante tells Forese that he hopes to return to the terrace soon because his city has become so corrupt.  Forese prophesizes that the man responsible for the downfall of Florence will be killed violently and descend to Hell shortly.  As Forese bids farewell to his friend, the poets move to another fruit tree.  A voice from within the branches of the tree tell the travelers to keep moving and remember these examples of gluttony: the centaurs who had to fight Theseus when they were drunk, and the soldiers who were rejected by Gideon for being drunk.  The angel of temperance descends and erases another Pfrom Dante's forehead.  Glowing like molten glass, the angel directs the poets to the next level as it recites the last part of the Fourth Beatitude: ""Blessed are those whom grace illumines so, that, in their breasts, the love of taste does not awake too much desire-whose hungering is always in just measure.""
	Purgatorio section 25: Statius, Dante, and Virgil climb the stairs to the Seventh (and final) Terrace where the Lustful serve their penance.  As they travel, Dante asks Virgil to explain how shades can suffer from hunger when their bodies are made of air and, therefore, have no need for food.  Virgil cites the example of Meleager, who starved because of a prophecy of the Fates, to suggest that Dante consider supernatural phenomenon as the explanation.  Virgil then turns to Statius for a more detailed response to Dante's question.  Based on a medieval understanding of reproduction, Statius' answer begins with the act of procreation.  Statius explains that refined blood passes from man to woman and creates a human being.  The fetus (although he does not use this term) goes through three stages of development: vegetative, sensitive, and intellective.  God creates the complete soul by endowing babies with the intellective faculty at birth.  At death, the soul leaves the body but retains its intellect, memory, and will.  When the soul reaches either Acheron (entrance to Hell) or Tiber (entrance to Purgatory) the soul assumes a body without mass that takes attributes of its former body.  The shades, therefore, see, hear, speak, and weep.  The poets reach the Seventh Terrace and find a river of fire.  Voices from within the flames chant ""Summae Deus clementiae"" (O God of supreme clemency).  After each hymn, spirits recite examples of chastity such as Mary's words during the Annunciation, and the banishment of Helice from the woods of Diana.  The shades also list names of men and women who were chaste during their lifetimes.
	Purgatorio section 26: Dante's shadow attracts the spirits' attention.  As Dante begins to explain his situation, two groups of spirits moving in opposite directions pass each other.  As they pass, the shades greet one another with quick kisses and one group shouts ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" while the other group cries that Pasiphae has turned into a cow to attract a bull.  Once the groups pass, the first group resumes its hymn-chanting.  Dante explains that he still lives as a mortal and asks the spirits to identify themselves.  One spirit reveals that the souls in the group yelling ""Sodom and Gomorrah"" were guilty of the unnatural vices for which Caesar was called ""queen"" while the other souls in the other group were guilty of natural lust.  The spirit identifies itself as Guido Guinizelli.  Dante expresses his admiration for Guido who he considered a preeminent writer of love poetry.  Guido, however points to another spirit, that of Arnaut Daniel, writhing in the flames as a better poet than himself.  Dante greets Arnaut who responds in the Provencal language.

Purgatorio section 27: As the angel of chastity descends to greet the poet it sings ""Beati mundo corde"" (Blessed are the pure in heart).  The angel urges the travelers to cross through the river of fire because there is no other way up the mountain to the Earthly Paradise.  Terrified that he will be burned alive, Dante at first refuses to enter the flames.  Virgil, however, encourages Dante by reminding him that Beatrice waits for him above.  At the mention of Beatrice, Dante enters the river and writhes in pain from the incredible heat.  Angelic voices urge the poets out of the flames.  Darkness falls as the poets, safe from the fire, lie down on the steps to rest until daybreak.  In his dream, Dante sees Leah who, picking flowers, tells Dante that she prefers to spend her time weaving her flowers into garlands while her sister, Rachel, prefers to look at her own beautiful eyes in a mirror.  After Dante awakens, the three poets resume their climb.  Although Dante will soon attain true happiness, Virgil explains that he has brought Dante as far as he can as his teacher.  Virgil states that having passed through Hell and Purgatory, Dante can now be his own guide.  Virgil's final words to his pupil: ""I crown and miter you over yourself.""
	Purgatorio section 28: Dante and Statius enter the divine forest of the Earthly Paradise.  Sweet odors, soft breezes, and chirping birds fill the air as Dante approaches a lovely stream followed by the spirits of the ancient poets.  Dante spies a beautiful woman picking flowers and singing across the river.  The lady nears the stream and Dante muses, ""No sooner had she reached the point where that fair river's waves could barely bathe the grass, than she gave me this gift: lifting her eyes.  I do not think a light so bright had shone beneath the lids of Venus when her son pierced her in extraordinary fashion."" The lady, Matilda, tells Dante that she will answer any questions that puzzle him.  Dante asks her to explain how breezes and flowing streams exist in this place.  Matilda replies that the breezes in the Earthly Paradise are created by motions of Heaven which always flow in the same direction.  A fountain created by the will of God feeds two streams: Lethe, and Eunoe.  Matilda concludes by instructing Dante to remember that the poets of the Golden Age had an understanding of this region where man first lived in innocence.
	Purgatorio section 29: Matilda resumes her singing as she moves along the banks of Lethe.  Dante keeps pace with her until they come to a sharp bend in the river.  Matilda stops and urges Dante, ""My brother, look and listen."" A great light sweeps across the forest as Dante hears music so lovely that it causes him to regret Eve having caused the casting out of humankind from Eden.  Dante invokes the Muses to help him describe this experience because he struggles to put his sentiments into words.  Dante sees seven lighted candlesticks in the distance.  Followed by twenty-four elders crowned in white lilies, the candles move slowly forward.  Four creatures each with six wings covered with eyes follow the elders.  With a head of gold and a body of red and white, a gryphon pulls a chariot amidst the four beasts.  Three ladies, red, green, and white, dance at one of the chariot's wheels while four ladies dressed in purple dance at the other wheel.  Two old men, one a physician and the other carrying a sword, follow the chariot while four humble men follow them.  Finally, one figure trails brings up the rear of the procession.  The procession halts at the sound of thunder.
	Purgatorio section 30: As the procession halts, the elders cry ""Veni, sponsa, de Libano"" (Come bride from Lebanon) and a group of angels drop flowers over the chariot as they sing ""Benedictus qui venis"" (Blessed are you who come).  A lady crowed with an olive garland and wearing a white veil emerges from the mist.  Dante recognizes Beatrice at once even though he cannot see her face.  Dante turns to express his happiness to Virgil but finds that his teacher has left.  Dante begins to weep but Beatrice tells him that he will soon weep for a different sorrow.  Beatrice tells the angels about Dante's sinful ways.  Dante recoils in shame.  Beatrice explains that although Dante has great talent and loved her faithfully while she was alive, he has strayed from God's plan after her death.  Although she tried to save him from Heaven, Beatrice realized that she had to bring him on this journey so that he could see the torment and torture of lost souls for himself so she went to Limbo to beseech Virgil to be Dante's guide. 
	Purgatorio section 31: Beatrice asks Dante if her accusations are true, ""tell, tell if this is true; for your confession must be entwined with such self-accusation."" Fraught with shame, Dante responds affirmatively.  Beatrice urges Dante to reveal the pitfalls that made him stray from his virtuous path.  Dante tries to explain that after Beatrice's death, he took pleasure in earthly vanities.  After this confession, Beatrice tells Dante that his memory of her should keep him from ever straying again.  Still hanging his head in deep shame, Dante stands across the river from Beatrice as she asks him to lift his eyes to gaze up her immortal beauty-something that will cause him more suffering.  Dante realizes that, even through her veil, Beatrice is ""seemed to surpass her former self in beauty as, here on Earth, she had surpassed all others."" Overcome with remorse, Dante faints.  As he revives, Dante finds Matilda standing over him.  Matilda leads Dante across Lethe where he can wash away his sins.  On the opposite shore of the river, the four women in purple greet Dante and usher him to Beatrice.  The three other dancing ladies urge Beatrice to raise her veil and look upon the poet who has traveled so far.  Beatrice raises her veil and Dante cannot find words to describe his experience thereafter.

Purgatorio section 32: Transfixed by Beatrice's gaze, Dante emerges from his trance only by the dancing ladies.  Dante compares his vision to that of a person who has looked directly at the sun.  As the procession begins to move again, Dante and Statius take positions with Matilda at the wheel of the chariot.  The marchers circle a tree and, after Beatrice steps to the ground, they connect the chariot to the tree.  Bursts of beautiful blossoms spring from the tree.  As the marchers begin to sing a hymn, Dante falls asleep under the tree.  When he awakens, Dante finds himself alone with Beatrice and her maids.  Guarding the chariot, Beatrice tells Dante to watch what is about to happen with care and to write about it when he returns to Earth.  An eagle emerges from the sky and attacks the tree, dropping feathers on the chariot.  Beatrice scares off a fox that tries to enter the chariot then a dragon emerges from the ground and breaks the chariot.  Feathers cover the remains of the chariot that sprouts seven horned heads.  A whore takes a seat upon the chariot then a giant joins her.  The giant kisses the harlot passionately but then beats her when he sees her attention turn to Dante.  Angrily, the giant pulls the chariot away and into the woods.
	Purgatorio section 33: Beatrice's maids weep over the destruction of the chariot but Beatrice tells Dante, Matilda, and Statius to follow her.  Dante tells Beatrice that he won't ask her any questions because she already knows what is proper for him to understand.  Beatrice admonishes Dante to dismiss his shame and fear.  Beatrice prophesies that God will instruct an avenger who will slay the whore and the giant.  Beatrice assures Dante that her words will soon become clear.  Dante vows to tell his story with clarity.  Beatrice asks Matilda to lead Dante to the river Eunoe.  As Dante and Statius prepare to enter Heaven, Dante states, ""From that most holy wave I now returned to Beatrice; remade, as new trees are renewed when they bring forth new boughs, I was pure and prepared to climb into the stars.""
	Paradiso section 1: Dante has seen God in all His glory but finds it difficult to articulate his experience as he begins the last of his three canticles on Heaven.  Dante invokes the assistance of Apollo to help him in this task.  The sun stands at high noon during the vernal equinox when Dante and Beatrice make their ascent from Purgatory to Heaven.  Beatrice and Dante turn to look directly into the flaming sun.  Dante can barely endure the brightness as he turns to face Beatrice.  As he gazes upon his beloved he becomes ""transhumanized""-he loses his physical body.  Upon reaching the Sphere of Fire, wonderful music and extreme brightness surround the travelers.  Beatrice explains that Dante's soul moved toward God so quickly because everything has a natural tendency to return to the point from which it came. 
	Paradiso section 2: Using a nautical metaphor, Dante advises his readers to follow him closely on this journey through Heaven.  Dante and Beatrice arrive in the Sphere of the Moon as quickly as an arrow.  Dante wonders how he can enter the opaque mass that surrounds them in this sphere.  After deliberating on the subject, Dante decides that this phenomenon may help explain Christ's incarnation.  Dante asks Beatrice to explain the cause of the dark spots on the moon.  Beatrice responds by asking Dante to first assert his own theory on the topic.  Dante proposes that the density of the moon varies across the surface.  In refuting Dante's theory, Beatrice raises several detailed and complex counterpoints and proposes an experiment using mirrors to refute Dante's variable density idea.  Instead, Beatrice explains that the energy and light emitted by God travel through the universe uniformly but hit heavenly bodies differently depending on the nature of the mass.  Thus, Beatrice asserts, the differences depend on quality rather than on quantity, as Dante had argued.
	Paradiso section 3: The cloudy faces of seven spirits appear in the haze and motion that they wish to speak with Dante.  One of the spirits identifies herself as Piccarda Donati and explains that God assigned to this realm the spirits, such as inconstant nuns, that broke their vows with God.  However, she continues, all the spirits in Heaven remain content regardless of their position relative to God.  Dante asks the spirits if they ever hope to ascend in Heaven.  Smiling, the spirits reply that they are happy with the station assigned to them through divine love.  Dante learns that although God's grace shines on souls in varying degrees, all souls that enter Heaven feel perfectly blessed.  Piccarda explains that she came to this station because her brother forced her to leave her convent to marry.  Another spirit, Constance, confirms that her story resembles Piccarda's story.  As Piccarda fades into the haze singing Ave Maria, Dante turns to Beatrice whose face has increased in brightness and beauty.

Paradiso section 4: Puzzled by two questions regarding Constance and Piccarda, Dante idles but does not broach the subjects with Beatrice.  Reading his thoughts, Beatrice first addresses Dante's question about whether souls return to the sphere of Heaven from which they were born or if all spirits live in the Empyrean (the highest level).  Beatrice explains that all spirits live in Empyrean but show their faces to Dante in the sphere with which they are associated.  The human intellect, Beatrice states, must perceive spirits in this manner because men need to see things to believe them.  Beatrice concludes her discourse by explaining why Plato was wrong in asserting that spirits return to the stars from which they came.  Next, Beatrice responds to Dante's question about the fairness of blaming people for actions that are forced against them.  Beatrice explains that fault lies in the acceptance of an act rather than in the act itself.  Piccarda and Constance, for example, failed to return to their convents when they were free to do so.  Dante wonders if people can pay for breaking vows by doing good deeds.  Beatrice directs her dazzling gaze on Dante who must turn away because of the brightness of her eyes.
	Paradiso section 5: Beatrice explains that her beauty and brightness increase as they ascend in Heaven because her joy increases.  Beatrice finds joy in Dante's spiritual enlightenment.  Beatrice then responds to Dante's last question by explaining that good deeds can never fully compensate for broken vows because when people break vows they exercise their most precious gift from God, free will, against God.  Additionally, although a vow cannot be withdrawn, the things that one promises can be replaced by other things in the ratio of six (replacement deeds) to four (deeds originally promised).  Beatrice then insists that all Christians must follow both the Old and New Testament when they make vows.  As Dante and Beatrice rocket to the next sphere, Beatrice's increased radiance causes the whole sphere to brighten.  Dante's heart leaps with delight in response to his beloved's beauty.  Dante finds himself amidst a thousand souls.  Dante begs the spirits to tell him who they are and how they came to this sphere.  One spirit begins to glow more brightly as it begins to speak to Dante.
	Paradiso section 6: The spirit addressing Dante here in the Sphere of Mercury belongs to Justinian, a sixth-century emperor.  Best known for codifying Roman law, Justinian dives into a canto-long discussion of the Roman Empire-its history and the symbolism of the eagle.  Some of the historical points raised by Justinian include: the establishment of Troy in Italy by Aeneas, the defeat of Hannibal, several important wars, Augustus, Tiberius, Titus, and Charlemagne.  Justinian concludes by remarking on the evil of those (the Guelphs) who wish to replace the eagle (the symbol of the Roman Empire) with the lilies of France while the Ghibellines hope to claim the eagle as a symbol for their faction alone.  Dante asks Justinian to discuss the nature of the spirits that appear in this sphere.  Justinian responds that these spirits belong to people who were virtuous in life but neglected God because of their desire for fame and honor.  A new spirit identifies himself to Dante as Romeo.  Romeo states that although he served his master well, he was driven to a life in exile by jealous courtiers.
	Paradiso section 7: Still in the Sphere of Mercury, Justinian's spirit rejoins the other lights in the sky.  Confused by an issue raised by Justinian, Dante wishes he could ask Beatrice to answer his questions but refuses to ask her because of her reverence for her.  Beatrice, however, can read Dante's unspoken thoughts so she gladly addresses Dante's question about the nature of vengeance.  Dante wonders why it was just for Titus to destroy Jerusalem if the Crucifixion was just vengeance for the sins of man.  Beatrice reminds Dante of the dual nature of Christ-human and divine.  The Crucifixion of the human side of Jesus was just punishment for the sins of man but the Crucifixion of the divine side of Jesus was a sacrilege.  Thus, the destruction of Jerusalem was just punishment for that sacrilege against God.  Beatrice then responds to Dante's second question about why God chose Crucifixion as the way to redeem man.  Beatrice explains that mankind was perfect when God first created humans but fell from grace because of Adam's sins.  Redemption for these sins could only come through divine mercy and there is no example of greater divine mercy than Christ's sacrifice at the cross.  Finally, Beatrice explains why men are incorruptible.  Her explanation justifies the notion that bodies and souls will be resurrected at Judgment Day.
	Paradiso section 8: Upon seeing Beatrice's beauty grow again, Dante realizes that they have ascended to the Sphere of Venus.  A spirit approaches and identifies himself as a great ruler (Charles Martel) who was loved by Dante.  Martel regrets the downfall of his family at the hands of poor rulers among its ranks.  Happy to see his friend, Dante asks Martel to explain how his brother could be such a poor ruler while his father was so great.  Martel explains that society must have diverse characters such as judges and mechanics.  Differences between father and son are created by God according to a divine scheme and any irregularities in families are due to Providence.  It is bad for society for men to overturn Providence so men who are born to be clergy members must become clergy members while men born to be warriors should become warriors.

Paradiso section 9: Charles Martel prophesies that great ill fortune will befall his family.  A new spirit approaches Dante.  The spirit identifies herself as Cunizza.  Cunizza states that the fame of the spirit next to her will last for five hundred years but she does not identify the nearby spirit.  Cunizza then criticizes the cruelty and mean spiritedness that prevails in her native land, Treviso.  The outspoken Cunizza predicts that her neighbors will soon meet misfortune.  As Cunizza departs, the famous but unnamed spirit steps forward.  The spirit identifies himself as Folco.  Folco reports that although he burned with desires during his lifetime, those memories cause him no pain now.  Folco identifies another nearby spirit as Rahab, the harlot of Jericho.  Despite her sinful life, Rahab earned salvation because she helped Joshua take Jericho.  Folco censures Florence for its corruption but predicts that Rome will soon free itself from the vices that have befallen Florence.
	Paradiso section 10: At this point, Dante urges his readers to think about the perfection of the universal plan.  Dante points out the movements of the sun and of the stars that create the seasons on Earth.  If the revolutions of the sun or of the stars strayed off path then everything on Earth would die.  Suddenly, Dante realizes that he and his guide have entered the Sphere of the Sun, a realm filled with intense brightness.  In that moment, Dante's consuming love for God surpasses his love for Beatrice.  Beatrice and Dante find themselves encircled by a crown of dancing, glorious lights that sing a beautiful melody.  A voice calls out from the crown that he will identify the spirits that surround the poet: Albert of Cologne, himself (St. Thomas Aquinas), Gratian, Peter of Lombard, and several others including Isadore of Seville, and Bede.  The twelve figures again begin to dance around Dante and Beatrice in perfect harmony.
	Paradiso section 11: Dante opens this Canto by musing on the senseless acts of mortals who pursue wealth and power.  How trivial their pursuits seem in comparison to his journey with Beatrice.  The dancing lights stop circling when St. Thomas addresses Dante.  St. Thomas declares that to ensure the union between the Church and Christ, Providence appointed two pious leaders.  The first leader, St. Francis of Assisi, gave up his wealth to devote himself to poverty.  St. Francis attracted disciples who followed their leader by accepting poverty in their hearts and in their behavior-they walked barefoot and wore ragged clothing.  St. Francis preached Christianity in Egypt and received the stigmata before he died.  The second leader, St. Thomas instructs, was St. Dominic who instructed his followers in humility and service to God. Many of Dominic's followers, however, became greedy and now few people in the Dominican order remain faithful to St. Dominic's guidance.
	Paradiso section 12: Still in the Sphere of the Sun, Dante notices a new ring of spirits encircle the first ring.  The two rings sing and move in harmony.  A voice from the second circle tells Dante that he too must extol the virtues of St. Dominic because St. Dominic and St. Francis were appointed by Christ to lead Christians back to God.  The spirit then goes on to detail the life story of St. Dominic.  Dominic was born in Calahorra where his mother had a prophetic dream about his greatness before he was born.  Dominic became a great teacher and traveled great distances to preach his message.  Dominic appealed to papal authority so that he could fight heretics.  The spirit then turns to a discussion of St. Francis.  He laments that factions within the Franciscan order are causing division.  The speaker finally identifies himself as the Franciscan, Bonaventura, then names all twelve spirits in the second circle.
	Paradiso section 13: Dante asks his reader to imagine the astronomical delights that surround him.  We are asked to think of the twenty-four brightest stars that we know arranged in a double crown.  The crowns circle in opposite directions as they sing about the glories of God and the dual nature of Christ.  St. Thomas Aquinas reads the question about the wisdom of Solomon lingering in Dante's mind.  Dante believes that both Adam and Christ had perfect wisdom so they should be placed above Solomon.  St. Thomas explains that one cannot compare Adam and Christ to Solomon because they were created directly by God while a minister of God created Solomon.  Solomon's wisdom, therefore, must be compared to the wisdom of other human rulers.  St. Thomas admonishes Dante for coming to an uniformed conclusion and cites incorrect philosophers and sacrilegious teachers as examples people who did not practice sound judgment.

Paradiso section 14: Beatrice asks the spirits to explain whether or not the spirits will retain their radiance after Resurrection when they rejoin their bodies.  The spirits sing a hymn to the Trinity three times then the voice belonging to Solomon responds.  According to Solomon, spirits will retain their radiance because it is an expression of their inner joy.  All bodily organs will develop the strength to withstand the extreme brilliance.  When body and soul meet again at Resurrection, the spirit will attain infinite and perfect glory.  A third crown surrounds the inner two and intensifies the brilliant light surrounding Dante.  The poet must look away to avoid blinding himself.  Beatrice comforts Dante and when he raises his eyes again, he realizes that they have entered the Sphere of Mars.  Dante observes two beams of light that intersect to form a cross.  Radiant spirits perform an intricate dance while they sing something that Dante cannot comprehend within the light beams.  Overcome with joy, Dante states that this experience surpasses all of the pleasures he has known.  However, Dante does make it clear that he had not yet viewed the beauty of Beatrice since they had ascended to the new sphere.
	Paradiso section 15: The music in the Sphere of Mars stops abruptly as the light of a spirit blazes down from the cross to approach Dante.  The cordial spirit expresses his delight at seeing his blood relative. Dante's ancestor speaks about issues too profound for Dante's comprehension then urges Dante to voice his questions.  Dante expresses his gratitude for the spirit's cordial greeting and asks him to identify himself.  The spirit is Cacciaguida, Dante's great-great-grandfather and the father of Alighiero, the family namesake.  Cacciaguida explains that when he lived in Florence the city was modest and honorable.  He was baptized in Florence and went on to serve Emperor Conrad II on a crusade.  He died in battle as a martyr.
	Paradiso section 16: Through his conversation with Cacciaguida, Dante realizes that ancestors must continually strengthen and bring honor to their bloodline if they hope to maintain the nobility of their blood.  Dante urges his great-great-grandfather to tell him when he was born and to identify the other families that lived in Florence during his time.  Cacciaguida indicates that he was born around 1100 A.D.  Cacciaguida, however, does not want to enumerate on the lives of his contemporaries.  Instead, he tells Dante that had the Church not fought against the Empire then Florence would not have captured towns in Tuscany from which refugees flooded into Florence.  In conclusion, Dante's elder lists numerous families that were thought to be noble during his time but have lost their strength now.  For some of the families, Cacciaguida notes the reason for their fall from grace.
	Paradiso section 17: Dante asks his forefather to tell him what his future holds.  Cacciaguida tells Dante that although God sees the future, He does not interfere with man's free will.  Dante's great-great-grandfather then tells Dante that his exile from Florence will be the result of a plot concerning the pope.  Cacciaguida prophesies the trials and tribulations that Dante will face in exile-that he will break from his fellow exiles, that he will find refuge with della Scala of Verona, and that he will meet Can Grande della Scala who will perform great deeds that relate to Dante.  Dante asks his elder if he should report what he has learned when he returns to Earth. Cacciaguida urges Dante to reveal all that he has learned even if it hurts or angers people.  Cacciaguida reminds Dante to be fearless and to let his poetic mission be his guide.
	Paradiso section 18: Dante turns to Beatrice while Cacciaguida concentrates on his own reflections.  Overcome by his beloved's radiant beauty, Dante doubts that he can properly describe the love that he feels from her.  Beatrice prompts Dante to turn his attention back to Cacciaguida when the elder's expression seems to change.  Cacciaguida decides to reveal the names of other spirits that dwell in the cross from which he came: Joshua, Judas Maccabaeus, Charlemagne, Roland, William of Orange, Renouard, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Robert Guiscard.  As Cacciaguida names each heroic soldier, the corresponding light in the cross shines with greater brilliance.  As Dante observes Beatrice's increasing beauty, he realizes that they have moved to the Sphere of Jupiter.  The souls in this realm wheel through the air like birds, flying in formation to spell a message: ""Diligite iustitiam qui iudicatis terram"" (Love justice, o you who judge the Earth).  Only the 'M' remains as the spirits fly away and rejoin the 'M' to form first a lily then an eagle.  Dante prays to understand earthly justice through divine justice then he denounces the papacy, specifically indicting Pope John XXII.

Paradiso section 19: Still in the Sphere of Jupiter, the spirits forming the emblem of the eagle speak to Dante in unison.  The eagle symbol states that it left piety and justice on Earth.  When Dante asks for clarification, the spirits state that divine justice is so complex that not even Lucifer could understand it.  Man, therefore, cannot hope to comprehend divine justice.  Dante wonders how it is just that a man in India who has never heard of Christ could be denied a spot in Heaven.  The eagle retorts that men can only accept the authority of the Scriptures to understand such issues. However, the eagle also explains that some non-Christians will find themselves closer to God on Judgment Day than will Christians who committed horrible sins.  The eagle concludes by berating evil rulers.
	Paradiso section 20: The spirits in the Sphere of Jupiter sing a glorious song then turn back to their discourse with Dante.  The eagle reveals that the most honored spirits form the eye of the eagle.  David stands at the very center of the eye while other great heroes such as Emperor Trajan, Hezekiah, Emperor Constantine, William II of Sicily, and Ripheus surround the eye.  The eagle reads Dante's confusion about the fact that two pagans, Trajan and Ripheus, occupy such honored positions.  The eagle explains that St. Gregory pulled Trajan out of Limbo through his prayers and that Ripheus knew about the coming of Christ and, believing in Christ, was baptized by the Christian virtues: faith, love, and hope.  The eagle admonishes mortals for coming to hasty judgments while the souls of Trajan and Ripheus glow with pleasure.
	Paradiso section 21: Beatrice's incredible beauty indicates to Dante that they have ascended to the Sphere of Jupiter.  Dante sees a golden ladder upon which spirits move up and down.  Dante asks one approaching spirit to explain why there is no singing in the sphere.  The spirit responds that Dante's mortal ears cannot hear the singing and that he has descended down the ladder to make Dante happy.  Dante asks why this spirit was nominated to greet him.  The spirit glows and spins with glee because ""Light from the Deity descends on [him]."" However, the spirit cannot fathom why he was chosen to meet Dante and he urges Dante to tell mortals not to bother trying to resolve questions of predestination and other divine mysteries.  The spirit identifies himself as St. Peter Damian and tells his holy story.  St. Peter Damian concludes his discourse with a strong censure of degenerate prelates.  Other spirits descend the ladder and join Damian in a clamorous shout that overcomes Dante.
	Paradiso section 22: Beatrice explains that the thunderous shout of the spirits expresses the admonishment of the clergy for its deterioration.  A brilliant light among the spirits on the ladder speaks to Dante.  The spirit belonging to St. Benedict relates the story of how he founded a Benedictine monastery in Monte Cassino.  He then points out two other spirits that devoted their lives to contemplation, St. Maccarius and St. Romualdus.  Dante begs to see Benedict in his physical form and the saint replies that his wish can only be granted when he ascends to the highest level of Heaven.  Benedict then rails against the current monastic life, calling monasteries ""dens of thieves."" Benedict then returns to his fellow spirits who mount the ladder in unison.  Dante and Beatrice follow the saints up the ladder and arrive in the House of Gemini (Dante's own Zodiac sign).  Dante turns to look downward and takes pleasure in how small and insignificant the Earth appears.  After admiring the beautiful planets that circle below him, Dante turns his gaze to Beatrice once again.
	Paradiso section 23: As Beatrice and Dante ascend to the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, Beatrice, her face aflame, gazes expectantly toward Heaven.  As Dante's beloved announces the approach of Christ, Dante notices a great light surrounded by numerous smaller lights in the distance.  At first Dante must lower his eyes from the shocking brilliance but with a smile that sends Dante into ecstasy, Beatrice urges her companion to view the divine scene.  Dante sees the light of Christ rise above him, the Rose (Empyrean) that represents Mary, and the lilies that represent the apostles.  A spinning light, representing Gabriel, circles the Rose and fills the air with sweet hymns devoted to Mary.  Mary follows Christ's light to heights beyond Dante's perception.  As she rises, spirits sing their adoration and call out her name.  In praise of the righteous apostles, Dante exclaims, ""Oh, in those richest coffers, what abundance is garnered up for those who, while below, on earth, were faithful workers when they sowed! Here do they live, delighting in the treasure they earned with tears in Babylonian exile, where they had no concern for gold.  Here, under the high Son of God and Mary, together with the ancient and the new councils, he triumphs in his victory-he who is keeper of the keys of gold.""

Paradiso section 24: Beatrice begs the gathered spirits to help teach Dante.  The spirit belonging to St. Peter detaches from the group and begins to examine Dante on his understanding of faith.  When St. Peter asks, ""What is faith?"" Dante cites Paul and replies, ""faith is the substance of the things we hope for and is the evidence of the things not seen; and this I take to be its quiddity."" Pleased, St. Peter presses Dante to elaborate on the uses of ""substance"" and ""evidence"" in this context.  Dante responds that faith alone supports the belief in the divine ideas and images that have been revealed to him on this journey.  This faith is ""called a substance"" and from this faith man must reason and make deductions that apply to the mortal world.  In this way, faith is also ""called an evidence."" St. Peter accepts Dante's answer and asks the poet how he came to understand these issues.  Dante replies that he learned about faith from the Holy Scriptures.  In conclusion, Dante states his belief in the Trinity.  St. Peter circles Dante three times to express his satisfaction and delight in Dante.
	Paradiso section 25: Dante expresses his hope to return to Florence to be crowned a poet in the Baptistry.  The spirit of St. James approaches and Beatrice asks the apostle to test Dante on the virtue of hope.  St. James asks, ""What is hope?"" Beatrice interrupts Dante before he can respond by telling St. James that there is no man more hopeful than Dante and his journey to Heaven proves such.  In response to St. James' question, Dante states, ""Hope is the certain expectation of future glory; it is the result of God's grace and of merit we have earned.  This light has come to me from many stars; but he who first instilled it in my hear was the chief singer of the Sovereign Guide (the psalms of David)."" Dante goes on to elaborate on the promises of hope as explained in the Bible.  A third light descends and dances joyfully with St. James and St. Peter.  Beatrice explains that this light belongs to St. John.  Following Beatrice's lead, Dante stares at St. John until the light blinds him.  St. John teases Dante as a hush falls over the realm.  Dante turns to Beatrice but cannot see her.
	Paradiso section 26: St. John comforts Dante by reminding him that Beatrice can heal his blindness.  Then, examining the poet on love and charity, the saint asks Dante who inspired him to seek such lofty goals.  Dante replies that he found inspiration in John's gospels, God's words to Moses, and in the writings of Aristotle.  The spirit then asks Dante to explain the force that binds him so closely to God.  Dante confirms that Christ's sacrifice strengthens his love for God and that he loves all of God's creatures.  Beatrice exclaims, ""Holy, holy, holy!"" and restores Dante's sight.  A fourth spirit belonging to Adam greets Dante as he emerges from his blindness.  Adam explains that God did not banish him from the Garden of Eden because he ate the forbidden fruit.  Instead, God sent Adam away because he disobeyed God.  Adam then reveals that he spend thousands of years in Limbo before he ascended to Heaven.  Adam reports that he lived in Eden for only six hours and that the language that was spoken there was lost even before the Tower of Babel.
	Paradiso section 27: ""'Unto the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, glory!'-all Paradise began, so that the sweetness of the singing held me rapt.  Whet I saw seemed to me to be a smile the universe had smile."" Still in the Sphere of Fixed Stars, Dante stands enraptured by the beautiful singing of the blessed.  The light of St. Peter glows brilliantly compared to the lights around him.  St. Peter denounces the modern papacy as degenerate and corrupt.  Of the recent popes, St. Peter states, ""He who on Earth usurps my place, my place, my place that in the sight of God's own Son is vacant now, has made my burial ground a sewer of blood, a sewer of stench, so that the perverse one who fell from Heaven, here above, can find contentment there below."" St. Peter warns that punishment for these sins will soon come and urges Dante to speak out strongly against papal corruption when he returns to Earth.  All of the spirits of the apostles, saints, and prophets ascend into the higher levels of Heaven as Dante gazes upon the Earth below.  Dante turns to Beatrice as they move to the next level, the Primum Mobile.  God's love powers this sphere which in turn controls the movement of all of the lower spheres.  Beatrice points out that time begins in this sphere then she launches into a discourse about how the world has strayed.  Beatrice remarks that men are not evil by nature.  Children, she explains, display innocence and faith but turn vicious as they grow-especially now because no one governs well.  However, Beatrice does believe that the world will find redemption.
	Paradiso section 28: In Beatrice's eyes, Dante sees God in relation to his angels.  When Dante turns from his beloved's eyes, he faces a tiny pinpoint of great brilliance surrounded by nine concentric circles of light.  Beatrice explains that the center light is God and that the surrounding spheres that are closer to God derive more energy than do the spheres farther away.  This pattern does not resemble the planetary system in which the outer spheres move faster.  Beatrice explains that God lives beyond the planetary system and, thus, creates the contradictory phenomenon.  Beatrice identifies the order of angels starting with the sphere closest to God: Seraphim, Cherubim, the Thrones, the Dominations, the Virtues, the Powers, the Principalities, the Archangels, and the Angels.  While all of the angels gaze upward toward God, their powers are channeled down to the appropriate spheres in the universe.  In conclusion, Beatrice reflects that Dionysis, a notable author who discussed angelic order, had been correct in his assertions.

Paradiso section 29: Reflecting on the center light of God, Beatrice pauses for a moment before she responds to several questions on Dante's mind.  Beatrice explains that God created angels in his own reflection.  God combined pure form and pure matter to create angels.  Thus, St. Jerome's assertion that God produced angels before spirit and matter existed, was incorrect.  After a band of angels was cast out of Heaven, the rest of the angels remained, circling the Heavens forever.  Beatrice censures theologians and preachers who idly speculate about such matters as the nature of angels.  These teachers contemplate divine mysteries at the expense of spreading and teaching the Gospel.  Beatrice concludes her discussion of angels by pointing out that their diversity reflects the diversity of God's love for them: ""The First Light reaches them in ways as many as are the angels to which It conjoins Itself, as It illumines all of them; and this is why (because affection follows the act of knowledge) the intensity of love's sweetness appears unequally.""
	Paradiso section 30: Of Beatrice's growing beauty, Dante writes: ""If that which has been said of her so far were contained within a single praise, it would be much too scant to serve me now.  The loveliness I saw surpassed not only our human measure-and I think that, surely, only its Maker can enjoy it fully."" Again, as Beatrice's beauty increases, she and Dante ascend to the next level of Heaven, the Empyrean.  Beatrice tells Dante that he will see angels and saints in their human form as they will appear at Resurrection.  Momentarily blinded, Dante regains his sight to see a river of light flowing past him.  Sparks fly out of the river and land on the flowers that line the banks.  Beatrice prompts Dante to touch his eyes to the river.  As he touches the light, the river turns into a sea and the sparks of the river transform into the shape of a giant rose.  A thousand tiers form the petals of the rose and a great light shines from the center.  Beatrice points to the few seats in the rose petals that are unfilled, one of which has been reserved for Emperor Henry VII.  Beatrice explains that Henry will attempt to free Italy.  The pope, Clement V, will stop Henry but find his punishment in Hell alongside Boniface VIII.
	Paradiso section 31: Dante describes the angels swarming throughout the great Rose: ""just like a swarm of bees that, at one moment, enters the flowers and, at another, turns back to that labor which yields such sweet savor, descended into that vast flower graced with many petals, then again rose up to the eternal dwelling of its love."" Overcome with joy, Dante quietly gazes upon the fiery faces of the blessed.  However, when Dante turns to question Beatrice, he finds that his beloved no longer stands beside him.  Instead, St. Bernard instructs Dante to turn his attention to the seat in the Rose where Beatrice now sits.  Dante expresses his profound gratitude to Beatrice who turns to him and smiles sweetly.  St. Bernard tells Dante to look at the highest tier to gaze upon Mary who sits enthroned in light and surrounded by thousands of angels that sing joyously.
	Paradiso section 32: St. Bernard explains the arrangement of the tiers of the Rose and points out several notable characters surrounding Mary: Eve, Rachel, Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and Ruth.  These Old Testament women form a dividing line between Christians who believed in Christ before he was born and those who believed in him after he took human form.  Opposite the line of women, sit the male saints: St. Francis, St. John the Baptist, St. Benedict, and St. Augustine.  Adults occupy the upper tiers of the Rose while infants sit in the bottom tiers.  St. Bernard again asks Dante to gaze upon Mary whose brilliance will prepare him to lay his eyes on Christ.  As Dante turns to Mary the entire assembly of angels sings ""Ave Maria"" with tremendous joy.  St. Bernard points out more important figures gathered around Mary: Adam, Peter, John the Apostle, Moses, St. Anne, and St. Lucy.  Dante's guide instructs him that he must earn Mary's grace before Christ will be revealed to him.
	Paradiso section 33: St. Bernard prays to Mary on Dante's behalf.  St. Bernard beseeches the mother of Christ to grant Dante a vision of God and the power to recount his journey on his return to Earth.  Pleased by St. Bernard's pious words, Mary turns her gaze toward the center light and St. Bernard prompts Dante to follow Mary's lead.  Dante looks up into the light and receives a glorious vision that he cannot fully recount because he has lost memory of it.  He still feels the emotion of the experience but he cannot recall the details of the encounter.  He invokes God to help him recall the scene so that he can tell the world about it.  Dante writes that he gazed into the light until he saw ""substances, accidents, and dispositions"" of the universe bound together by love into a single volume.  Dante reveals that he saw within the Eternal Light, three circles of different colors reflecting each other.  In one of the circles he saw a human face that puzzled him completely.  Finally, a great flash of revelation brought his desires and will into alignment.  The revelation, Dante reports, was caused by God's love, the love ""that moves the sun and the other stars.""

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Novel Summary: Chapters 1-3,"Chapters1-3
Chapter1: Huck begins his narration, explaining that this story takes up where the previous one, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, left off: he owns six thousand dollars from the money he found in the cave, and this money he has given to Judge Thatcher, who is keeping the money and paying him interest. He lives with the Widow Douglas (who is trying to civilize him) because Tom won't let him join his ""gang"" otherwise.
	Restlessly lying in bed one night, he hears Tom Sawyer calling to him through the window, and the two escape together into the woods.
	Chapter 2: After playing a trick on Jim, Miss Watson's slave, Tom and Huck meet the rest of the boys in the woods. Tom tells everyone that to be in the gang, they must take an oath and sign their names in blood. If any one of them breaks the secrecy of the gang, however, his family will be killed. Since Huck doesn't really have a family, he tells the others that they may kill Miss Watson if he spills any secrets. As daylight approaches, the gang agrees to meet at a later date to go about the business of ""[robbing] somebody and [killing] some people.""
	Chapter 3: Huck briefly explains how he gave up the religion Miss Watson was trying to force on him and how his father was said to be drowned but that he didn't believe it. Next, he says that the gang has broken up, because they weren't doing any real violence, but just pretending. The comical scene of the Sunday School picnic, where Tom tells Huck that actually the schoolchildren are a procession of rich Arabs and their elephants, uncovers the differences between the two boys. Like Don Quixote, Tom is the idealist, while Huck is the realist who doesn't believe his friend's ""lies.""

Chapter 4: Huck explains that he has been going to school fairly regularly now, and that he doesn't mind it too badly. He also says that he's getting used to living with the Widow Douglas and her sister.
	In this chapter Twain continues to show Jim's belief in superstition and magic, as Huck says that the slave taught him quite a bit about the subject. He even tells Huck's fortune for him, telling him that his life will be filled with both joy and grief. Later, the reader will notice that Jim's magic signs often serve as foreshadowing for the future.
	Chapter 5: Huck's pap surprises him when he climbs into his bedroom window to confront him. The fifty-year-old man yells at his boy for getting an education, demanding that he quit school and give up ""religion"" immediately. It seems the old man is afraid that his son will know more than he does. What his father mainly wants, however, is to get his hands on Huck's six thousand dollars.
	Later, going before the judge, Huck's pap promises to change his ways, saying that he will become civilized and live decently. This cons the judge for awhile, but when the old man gets drunk the very same night, everyone realizes that there's no chance he will ever change.
	Chapter 6: In this chapter, Huck's pap kidnaps the boy, and the two live a few miles away in a shack deep in the woods. For two months the father and son live together there, and Huck admits that he didn't really want to return to the Widow Douglas' house anyway. Huck enjoys the freedom life in the wilderness affords him, noting that he took up cussing again since his father didn't mind.
	One night, however, Huck's pap gets drunk and starts chasing him around the cabin with a knife, calling him the Angel of Death. Luckily he falls asleep on the floor, sparing his son's life for the time being at least.

Chapter 7: Tired of being constantly locked in the cabin by his father for days at a time, Huck decides to dig a hole to the outside, taking care to cover it up with a stump so his pap doesn't see it. One day after his father locks him in as usual, Huck leaves the cabin through his hole, goes hunting, kills a pig and brings it back. He spatters the blood all about and smashes in the door to the shack, making it look as if he's been murdered. He next gets into a canoe and paddles to Jackson's Island, a nearby, uninhabited wilderness area where he plans to hide for awhile. Ironically, Huck is able to live only by feigning his own death.
	Chapter 8: Hearing the noise of a cannon coming from a ferryboat traveling down the river, Huck immediately realizes that they are hoping to bring his body to the surface. The boat comes so close to the island that he can even see those he knows onboard as they scan the water for his corpse.
	Having stayed several days on the island now, Huck admits that he really enjoyed the freedom it gave him. He explains, ""I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say..""
	Soon thereafter, however, Huck encounters an acquaintance on the very same island, hiding, just as he is doing. This is Jim, Miss Watson's slave. Seeing the boy, Jim immediately falls to his knees, believing Huck to be dead and thus thinking that he is seeing his ghost. The two explain their stories to one another, and they agree to help each other escape. Huck admits that being with Jim made him feel less lonely.
	Chapter 9: In this chapter, Huck and Jim find a small wooden raft that has drifted ashore; this raft will be used later.
	Seeing a damaged houseboat float by one night, Huck and Jim decide to paddle out to it to see what supplies they can garner. Jim sees a dead man aboard the vessel, but persuades Huck not to look at his ""ghastly"" face.

Chapter 13: Getting into the rowboat that the murderers themselves were planning to get away in, Huck and Jim hurriedly hurl themselves into the little boat and finally get away from the whole fiasco. They find their raft further downstream as they pass a ferryboat with a watchman on deck. Huck, wanting to help the ""rapscallions"" who he and Jim had stranded, tells this man that he is from the wrecked steamboat (ironically named the Walter Scott) and that his family is still on board.
	Later, Huck thinks to himself that the Widow Douglas would be quite proud of him for helping the men, since these are the kind, according to her, that most need helping.
	Chapter 14: Looking through the supplies they had received from the wreck, Huck and Jim talk about the adventures they've just had. Through the course of the conversation, Huck admits that Jim ""had an uncommon level head, for a nigger."" This shows that some of Huck's assumptions about Jim are beginning to change.
	Next, perhaps the most comical scene in the book takes place as Huck and Jim discuss the nature of kings and dukes. Huck, who has read more about them in his books, explains to Jim that kings don't do any work, but still get to have as much of anything as they want. Jim's knowledge of kings is limited to ""King Sollermun."" The two have a humorous conversation about him, and this leads into a discussion of languages, Jim not understanding the nature of different languages. This all serves to show Huck that Jim, though he may have an ""uncommon level head,"" is incredibly ignorant and stubborn.
	Chapter 15: Still planning on getting into the free states of the North, Jim and Huck continue their journey. Eventually the two get separated from each other, and Jim comes to believe that Huck has died. When Huck finds Jim a bit later, Jim is surprised but happy to see him again.

Chapter 16: Believing themselves to be close to freedom now, Huck begins to feel guilty for having helped Jim escape. Southern society has taught him that freeing a slave is a sin, and Huck starts to worry that he will go to hell.
	Being forced to postpone these thoughts for later, however, Huck is confronted by men who are looking for fugitive slaves. Wanting to search the raft for the slaves, the men begin to row out to it. Huck, however, ingeniously dissuades the men from such action by telling them that his father is onboard and has smallpox. Instead of helping, the men give Huck some money in charity.
	Later, now night, Huck and Jim jump overboard and are separated when a much larger vessel cuts their little raft into two pieces. Huck nearly drowns, but manages to reach shore, not having heard any sign of Jim.
	Chapter 17: Now on land, Huck walks a few paces before he hears a male voice yelling at him from a nearby house window. Apparently he has reached the Grangerford family headquarters. When asked who he is, Huck tells the man that his name is George Jackson and that he has just fallen off the steamboat. Taking him inside, the man examines Huck by candlelight, convinced that he isn't a Shepherdson, the name of the family with which the Grangerfords are feuding.
	The Grangerford family takes Huck in, and he admits that they were really nice. The ironic thing is, despite their obsession with feuding, the family seems to be very religious. Twain obviously uses this to further his indictment of religion.
	Chapter 18: Huck's education continues. He learns that the Grangerford family is practically part of the aristocracy. The other competing aristocracy in town seems to be the Shepherdsons. The families are feuding, Huck is told, because of some dispute that happened many years ago. When he asks what the nature of the dispute was, no one knows. All of this seems quite ridiculous to Huck.
	Soon word reaches the house that Miss Sophia, the beautiful daughter of the household, has run away to elope with a young man from the Shepherdson family. This immediately causes all the men of the house to fetch their guns and prepare for battle. Traveling with Buck, Huck himself sees the bloodshed first-hand. All of it, however, makes him sick to his stomach, especially when he sees Buck killed.
	Luckily, he meets Jim in the woods, and the two of them run back towards the river, away from the senseless feuding.

Chapter 19: In this chapter, after Huck and Jim have been traveling for a bit, they encounter two men who are running for their lives, being chased by dogs and men, they say. They ask Huck if they can get away with them, and Huck agrees. Eventually the men announce to each other and to Huck and Jim that they are actually a king and duke, who have lost their kingdoms. Huck doesn't say anything, but he admits to the reader that he thinks ""these liars warn't no kings nor dukes, at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.""
	Chapter 20: Wondering about Jim, the king and duke ask Huck if he's a runaway slave. Huck is adamant in his denial, saying that they wouldn't be traveling south if he were a fugitive slave (They are forced to travel south now because of the current, which of course heads south on the Mississippi.). Huck follows his denial by telling them a compelling story about themselves. Here and elsewhere in the book, it becomes apparent to the reader that Huck is an amazing liar.
	It also soon becomes apparent what the king and duke do for a living: they are frauds and cheats, just as Huck suspected. Stopping at a town downstream, both the king and the duke leave the raft, using their knack for deception to cheat quite a sum of money out of the people.
	Chapter 21: Now in Arkansas, the king and duke begin orchestrating their next scheme: the enactment of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet. Also in this chapter Huck witnesses a mob scene caused by a petty local dispute.

Chapter 22: The description of the mob scene continues, though it turns out that no one is lynched because the mob is full of cowards.
	The Shakespeare show also takes place this night, but with only a meager turnout, the king and duke change their plan for the next night and put up signs around the town for a show called ""The Royal Nonesuch."" The real appeal of the show is the fact that women and children are prohibited from coming. This will surely cause some excitement, the duke proudly exclaims.
	Chapter 23: The first two nights of the Royal Nonesuch performance takes place in this chapter. What the show really amounts to is simply the duke walking onto stage and telling everyone that they have been duped and asks them to mention the show for the following two evenings to their friends. The people, who have each been conned into paying 50 cents for the ""show,"" are enraged and start to rush stage when one among them calls for them to stop, saying that they will be the ""laughing-stock"" of the town if they don't con their fellow citizens into buying tickets for the following two nights. Everyone agrees, and no violence is done to the king or duke at this time. The following two nights follow the same pattern, except on the third night the duke doesn't dare to enter the stage, knowing that the people plan to get their revenge on him this time. So instead, he and Huck run back to the raft, getting away with over four hundred dollars for the three ""performances.""
	The most important part of the chapter, however, is a conversation between Huck and Jim, when Huck realizes that Jim severely misses his family. This causes Huck to admit, ""I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n."" Thus, Huck continues to realize that Jim is as much a person as anyone else.
	Chapter 24: Meeting a fellow traveler, the king starts up a conversation with the man, finding out that the town is anticipating the arrival of the English brothers of Peter Wilks, a wealthy landowner who has recently died and thus has quite a sizable inheritance to give to his relatives. The king and duke jump on this opportunity, and after leaving the man who possessed such valuable information, ask for directions to the Wilks' home.

The king gives a speech, where he even brings himself to tears over the apparent death of his brother. One man, however, the family physician, doesn't believe that these men are genuine, but tells the town that they must be frauds. Their English accents, for one, don't seem quite authentic to his trained ear. Luckily for the king and duke, however, the town doesn't believe the doctor, but rallies behind them instead.
	Chapter 26: The king and duke, now in one of the Wilks' private rooms, plot their next move. A bag of gold has come into their possession and they decide to hide it for safe-keeping. Huck, however, feels guilty and partially responsible for the scheme, since he is with the king and duke. He decides to hide the gold himself to prevent the king and duke from getting their hands onto it.
	Chapter 27: Now with the bag of gold, Huck proceeds to find a place to hide it. Unfortunately, someone is heard approaching from another room, and fearing that he will be caught with the bag in his hand, he is forced to hide the gold in the casket itself.
	Soon the funeral ceremony takes place, and though many people are near the casket, no one seems to discover the gold.
	Planning their getaway, the king and duke realize that the gold is no longer where they had hidden it. They interrogate Huck about the matter, but they ultimately come to believe that some of the house slaves must have stolen the gold.

	Huck returns to the wigwam to think, considering whether or not to send a letter to Miss Watson telling her Jim's whereabouts. He ultimately decides against this, believing he will be the laughing stock of the town for helping a slave escape.He also considers how wicked he has become, thinking that he must be surely damned for such actions. He accepts this fate, however, believing that he's going to hell anyway so he might as well help his friend, Jim.
	Thus, Huck begins to walk towards the Phelps' farm. On the way, however, he encounters the duke, who is putting up a flyer for another Royal Nonesuch performance. The duke blames the king for selling Jim, saying that he took all the money for himself. He tells Huck that Jim is forty miles away, making up a story to get rid of the boy. Of course Huck realizes that he's being lied to, but he pretends to follow the duke's advice, starting off right away towards the place the duke has directed him.

This chapter is very exciting; it takes place in the home of Monte Cristo during his party.  When Madame Danglars and Villefort are shown through the gate, Bertuccio recognizes them as the pregnant woman and the man from his story.  Bertuccio is shocked that Villefort is alive, yet he's sure that he is the person he stabbed.  Strangely, Bertuccio also recognizes Andrea, the ""son"" of the retired major.  It seems Adrea's real name is Benedetto.  
	Throughout the evening, the count tortures Madame Danglars and Villefort, knowing about their secret affair and the baby they tried to bury to death.  First, the count takes them to the bedroom, pretending to make conjectures about the ""sinister"" deeds which must have happened there so many years ago.  Later, he takes them to the garden where Villefort thought he buried their son.  The count tells them that during a construction project, a baby skeleton was dug up.  This is too much for Madame Danglars-- she turns pale and faints.

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 1," 
Note: All page numbers in this summary and analysis refer to the edition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Hound of the Baskervilles published in 2009 by Fall River Press.
This NovelGuide also draws on Leslie S. Klinger, ed., The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Novels (New York and London: W.W. Norton, 2006). Citations reading “Klinger” refer to this reference work.
Chapter 1: Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Summary: On a morning in 1879, John Watson, M.D., awakes to find the private detective Sherlock Holmes, with whom he shares lodgings at 221-B Baker Street, unexpectedly seated at the breakfast table. Holmes invites Watson to examine a walking stick left behind by an unmet visitor the previous night. What, Holmes wonders, can Watson deduce about the stick’s owner? Watson hazards his observations, only to have them clarified and corrected by Holmes, his deductive superior. Shortly thereafter, the walking stick’s owner, one James Mortimer, M.R.C.S. (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons), arrives. After exclaiming his delight at having the chance to observe Holmes’ skull (for he has heard of the detective’s brilliant intellect), he proceeds to tell Holmes and Watson why he is seeking the master detective’s help.
Analysis: Having grown tired of writing the adventures of the world’s first consulting detective and eager to turn his attention to more “serious” literature, Arthur Conan Doyle attempted to finish off his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, by sending him over the Reichenbach Falls as the detective grappled with his archnemesis, Professor Moriarty, in a short story entitled “The Final Problem” (December 1893). The title would, of course, prove overly optimistic! Enthusiastic readers of the Holmes tales clamored for the sleuth’s return. Conan Doyle obliged with The Hound of the Baskervilles, the third—and still hailed by many critics as the best—Sherlock Holmes novel. Conan Doyle did, however, carefully label the book as “another adventure” of Holmes of the first edition’s title page—an indication that the events in its pages took place prior to “The Final Problem,” and that the reading public should not expect any further stories. When the novel proved an instant success, however, readers pressed for more. Conan Doyle relented and engineered Holmes’ “resurrection” in 1903.
The first chapter of the present work appropriately bears Holmes’ name as its title, for it is largely a brief character sketch of the detective, introducing him or reintroducing him to the book’s audience through the eyes of his erstwhile companion, Dr. John Watson. The chapter also introduces James Mortimer, an adherent of phrenology, the now-discredited belief prevalent in Victorian science, that study of the shape of the skull indicates mental capacity and even moral character. “You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes,” Mortimer announces. “I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic [i.e., relatively long] a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital [i.e., above the eyeballs] development” (p. 18). The comment is exactly the kind of thing one would expect a self-professed (and perhaps not a little self-important) “dabbler in science” to say (p. 18). Mortimer also manages the relatively uncommon feat of being able to wound Holmes’ pride when he declares Holmes “the second highest expert in Europe” (p. 19). Mortimer ranks Holmes behind Alphonse Bertillon, “chief of criminal investigation for the Paris police from 1880” (Klinger, 397). Bertillon’s method of photographing and measuring the distinctive physical traits of criminal suspects—in profile and full-on views, the basis for the modern “mug shot”—proved highly influential in police practice worldwide, only to be superseded by the advent of fingerprinting at the turn of the 20th century. Fortunately for Mortimer, his conviction that Holmes remains the most knowledgeable “practical man of affairs” (p. 19) ensures that Holmes will give Mortimer’s case a hearing.
Mortimer demurs when Holmes addresses him as “doctor.” According to Klinger, Mortimer’s M.R.C.S. credentials are today “regarded as a specialist higher qualification in surgery, awarded to doctors who have already qualified in their profession and have elected to practice in the surgical branch of it… In Mortimer’s day [, however], the M.R.C.S. was the surgical half of the standard qualification to practice, not an advanced degree, and surgeons in fact occupied a lower position in the medical hierarchy than physicians, who diagnosed patients and prescribed medication” (pp. 388-89).

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 2 - 5," 
Summary: Mortimer reads to Holmes and Watson an early 18th-century manuscript that tells of how, in the time of the “Great Rebellion” [i.e., 1641-51], Hugo Baskerville, progenitor of the ancient and wealthy Baskerville line and a “wild, profane and godless man,” kidnapped the maiden daughter of a yeoman who held lands near his estate. For this crime, the document claims, Hugo Baskerville died, ravaged by “a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.” The Baskervilles thus believe a curse has been placed upon their family. Holmes dismisses the story, but is more intrigued when Mortimer reads a recent newspaper account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. A generous philanthropist and a potential candidate for Parliament in an upcoming election, Sir Charles (descendant, of course, of the notorious Hugo) had restored much of his famly’s greatness after it had fallen upon hard times by capitalizing on financial speculations in South Africa. A widower, Sir Charles lived only with his servants at Baskerville Hall, a married couple, the Barrymores, who worked as butler and housekeeper. He lived near Mortimer, who was his personal physician; as well as one Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and Mr. Stapleton, a naturalist. Sir Charles was keenly interested in the legend of the Baskerville curse, asking Mortimer several times whether he ever saw or heard strange creatures and noises, especially “the baying of a hound.” Each night before retiring to bed, Sir Charles would walk the Hall’s “famous yew alley.” He never returned from that walk on the evening of May 4; at midnight, Mr. Barrymore found his master lying dead at the alley’s end, past its gate that opens onto the moor surrounding the Hall. Sir Charles’ face wore a terrifyingly distorted expression (attributed in the autopsy to cardiac exhaustion). Barrymore noted that the appearance of Sir Charles’ footprints altered once he had passed that gate, but reported no other physical clues to the inquest. Information that the newspaper account does not include, but what Mortimer now tells Holmes, is that, three weeks prior to Sir Charles’ death, Mortimer had visited the nobleman and caught a glimpse of some large, unknown black animal—the sight of which visibly shook Sir Charles. Furthermore, in the yew-alley, Mortimer saw the “fresh and clear” footprints of a gigantic hound.
Analysis: Conan Doyle effectively creates a mood of suspense and fear in this chapter: even though it is set in Holmes and Watson’s Baker Street apartment, it is filled with evocative, atmospheric descriptions of Baskerville Hall, the site of strange—and, perhaps, supernatural—occurrences. The novel is a work of mystery, not horror; nevertheless, this chapter contains elements that might equally be at home in a Gothic tale of terror: the ancient family manor, recently refurbished but still bearing marks of “evil days” gone by (p. 26); a secret, shameful family history in the tale of Hugo Baskerville and his fellow drunken revelers who are struck by terror on the moonlit moors, only to be pursued by evil and misfortune until their (sometimes untimely) deaths; and, of course, our first description of the titular hound, with “its blazing eyes and dripping jaws” (p. 24)—“such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels” (p. 23). The circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death, as well, laid out in careful detail by Conan Doyle as he sets the stage for the detective tale to follow, inspire feelings of dread, which culminate in Mortimer’s nearly whispered revelation that he has seen “the footprints of a gigantic hound” (p. 30). (Indeed, we will read at the beginning of the next chapter that Mortimer’s words gave Watson, a man of science, “a shudder,” p. 31!) Some critics have pointed out that, in real life, one cannot tell the breed of dog merely from its pawprints; but, as Baker Street Journal editor Edgar W. Smith noted, Mortimer’s frequently quoted, chapter-concluding line is all about maximum artistic impact: “I remember one of my sons, when he was very young, going about the house muttering: ‘Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic cocker-spaniel!’ That, I am sure, would not have had quite the same dramatic effect…” (Klinger, p. 414).
 
Chapter 3: The Problem
Summary: Holmes questions Mortimer and establishes that the dog he saw was not a sheep dog; that the wicket-gate is the only exit from the yew-alley that leads to the moor, and that Sir Charles had apparently stood there for some time; that the hound’s footprints were clearly on the path and not on the surrounding grass; and that three people report having seen the hound prior to Sir Charles’ death, but none have reported seeing it since. For all this attention to the details of the night in question, however, Mortimer reveals that he does not wish Holmes to investigate Sir Charles’ death. Rather, he has approached the detective for advice about what to do when Sir Charles’ only heir, one Henry Baskerville, returns from abroad. (The only other kinsman was one Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’ youngest brother and “the black sheep of the family,” who is reported to have died in Central America in 1876.) Mortimer wants the charitable work begun by Sir Charles to continue, and knows that, to that end, Baskerville Hall must have a squire; but he does not want Sir Henry to go to Baskerville Hall for fear of the curse upon the family. Holmes is, of course, deeply skeptical of all such supernatural beliefs; he recommends that Mortimer simply meet Sir Henry at Waterloo Station upon his arrival, yet not tell him anything of the current situation. Mortimer departs, as does Watson, who knows that his friend needs isolation in which to reflect upon the facts of the case. When Watson returns several hours later, he finds Holmes poring over a topographical map of the Baskerville estate and the surrounding lands. Holmes has also concluded that, contrary to Sir Charles’ usual routine, the squire of Baskerville Hall was waiting at the wicket-gate; and that the shifting shape of Sir Charles’ footprints as reported by Mortimer must be due to the fact that Sir Charles began running away from something in terror.
Analysis: Conan Doyle created one of the most famous rationalists in world literature, yet he himself remained very open to “supernatural explanation[s]” of worldly phenomena (p. 38). The author was a committed Spiritualist (including his adherence to the belief that the dead could communicate with the living), and is also remembered as one of the more famous defenders of the “Cottingley fairies,” a 1917 incident in which two young girls purported to have taken photographs of fairies in their garden (later proved to be cardboard cutouts). Sherlock Holmes would never for a moment have been taken in by such a ruse, as this chapter makes plain. “We are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses,” he tells Watson, “before falling back upon” supernatural ones (p. 38). Although Holmes demonstrates some respect for Mortimer—when the physician notes the two separate droppings of ash from Sir Charles’ cigar, Holmes proclaims him to be “a colleague, Watson, after our own heart” (p. 33)—he clearly rejects Mortimer’s eager embrace of the paranormal and the otherworldly. As Holmes correctly points out, such an attitude does not quite seem to befit “a trained man of science” (p. 34). Holmes points out inconsistencies in supernaturalism’s own internal logic: for example, he seeks to disarm Mortimer’s fear for Sir Henry’s fate were the scion of the family to return to the state by pointing out that “surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire” (p. 35). And whereas Mortimer gives easy credence to reports of “several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature” (p. 33), Holmes makes it his life’s work to achieve such reconciliations. In maxim-like fashion, Holmes declares to Watson (who is very often the recipient of such lessons in the Holmes stories), “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes” (p. 37). Observation and logic, not a resort to supernatural hypotheses, prove critical to Holmes’ success.
The detective concerns himself with the real world: “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?” he asks (p. 38). As one who has apprehended many criminals prior to this case, Holmes knows the answer must be affirmative!
Chapter 4: Sir Henry Baskerville
Summary: At ten the next morning, Mortimer arrives at Baker Street with Sir Henry Baskerville, who has already experienced a singular occurrence. Although no one should have known that he had stayed the night at the Northumberland Hotel, he received a letter addressed to him there: a single sheet of paper containing a message composed of words—all but the last one—clipped from a printed source and affixed to the sheet: “As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.” To everyone’s astonishment, Holmes immediately identifies the source of the clippings as the lead article from the previous day’s Times. (The word “moor” had to be supplied by hand in ink because it is a less common word.) Holmes further deduces (from the ink splotches, indicative, he says, of a hotel fountain pen) that the sender of the letter assembled it in a hotel near Charing Cross (from the envelope’s postmark). Whether the letter is warning or threat, no one seems sure. Sir Henry is still unaware of the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death; Mortimer gives him the same account he gave Holmes and Watson the previous day. Sir Henry reports that he bought a new pair of boots upon his arrival in London, and, never having worn them, left them outside his hotel room in order to be varnished overnight. That morning, he discovered one of the boots, and one only, had been stolen. Mortimer and Sir Henry begin walking back to the hotel; allowing them a lead of two hundred yards, Holmes and Watson follow them, unbeknownst to the baronet and the physician. Holmes spies a bearded man in a hansom cab also shadowing the pair; unfortunately, the bearded man notices Holmes and Watson in return, and urges his driver to move quickly on, so that Holmes and Watson cannot catch up. They lose the trail of the hansom cab; they lose track of Mortimer and Sir Henry; but Holmes did note the number of the cab (No. 2704). He plans to send a telegram to ascertain the identity of the driver of that cab; meanwhile, he hires a teenager named Cartwright to inspect the garbage from the 23 hotels in the Charing Cross area, looking for a cut-up front page of yesterday’s Times. This evidence, Holmes reasons, will lead them to the person who sent Sir Henry his mysterious letter.
Analysis: As a character, Sir Henry is not yet well-developed in this chapter; however, that is due to the fact that he serves mainly as a way for Conan Doyle to introduce deeper levels of mystery into the tale (the enigmatic letter and the stolen boot). We do, however, read that Sir Henry has “the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air”—indicative, as he says, of having spent most of his life in the United States and Canada (p. 46)—but also “the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman” (p. 41). Sir Henry is both rugged and genteel, civilized and of the frontier. He also intends to continue the good works of his uncle: he intends to fully embrace his role as “squire” (p. 47) of Baskerville Hall. “There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer” (p. 48). This resolve speaks to Sir Henry’s “fiery temper,” a family trait (p. 48). Therefore, although we do not yet know much about him, he emerges from this chapter as a sympathetic character in whose fate readers will be interested.
This chapter also, of course, serves to further dazzle Conan Doyle’s readers with Holmes’ logical prowess. His knowledge of various typefaces (although he allows that, as a younger man, he “confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News,” p. 44—surely a fully self-aware statement of false humility, since most ordinary people would not even begin to know how to distinguish the papers’ typography), his immediate recall of the number of hotels in the Charing Cross area, his identification of the kind of scissors used by the letter’s compositor, his knowledge of the traits of hotel fountain pens—all these instances further establish Holmes (as though he needed any such establishment in the minds of Conan Doyles’ reading audience!) as master of his “special hobby” of detection (p. 44). We also learn, however, that Holmes does not rely solely on his own efforts. His employment of young Cartwright hearkens back to his use of “the Baker Street Irregulars”—a ragamuffin group of street urchins, who perform various tasks and find out information for Holmes for a shilling reward—in the Conan Doyle’s two previous Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four.
Chapter 5: Three Broken Threads
Summary: At the Northumberland Hotel, Holmes and Watson find Sir Henry distraught because an old black boot was returned to him in place of the new brown one that was stolen. At lunch, Sir Henry announces his intention to go to Baskerville Hall at the week’s end, a decision Holmes affirms. When Sir Henry asks Holmes to accompany him, Holmes regrets that he cannot, but suggests that Watson go in his stead. Holmes tells Sir Henry and Mortimer that they were followed yesterday; he learns that Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, has a full, dark beard, as did Sir Henry and Mortimer’s unknown follower. Barrymore and his wife were left £500 each in Sir Charles’ will. Other beneficiaries include £1000 to Mortimer and numerous other individuals and charities. Sir Henry is inheriting £740,000. In all, Sir Charles’ estate is valued “close on to a million.” Holmes learns that, had Sir Henry been unable to inherit the estate, it would have passed to one James Desmond, an elderly clergyman. As the group rises from lunch, Sir Henry spies his missing new brown boot under a cabinet in a corner of the dining room, even though all previous searches had not located it.
Upon returning to Baker Street, Holmes receives telegrams informing him that Barrymore the butler is at Baskerville Hall, and that Cartwright was unable to locate the cut-up front page of the previous day’s Times. Also, he and Watson receive a visit from John Clayton, the driver of hansom cab no. 2704. Clayton tells them that his fare, so interested in trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer, was a detective by the name of Sherlock Holmes! Holmes is amused at having been bested by their unknown opponent, but warns Watson that the case is rapidly developing into “an ugly dangerous business.”
Analysis: The chapter title is metaphorical, of course: when the interview with Clayton fails to yield the name of his fare, Holmes laments, “Snap goes our third thread [of investigation], and we end where we began” (p. 63). (The other two threads were the location of Barrymore—his presence at Baskerville Hall would seem to argue against his being the bearded man who followed Sir Henry and Mortimer—and Cartwright’s failure to find the mutilated newspaper.) Notice, however, how Holmes often takes setbacks in stride. He greets Clayton’s revelation that his fare was “Sherlock Holmes,” for instance, with “a hearty laugh,” proclaiming (using a metaphor from the sport of fencing), “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” (p. 61). (Klinger notes that Holmes is here alluding to Hamlet, Act V, Scene ii: “Is this further evidence of Holmes’ acting career or merely of his knowledge of literature?”, p. 457.) Holmes is secure enough in his own intellectual ability to recognize when others have bested him (a trait we see in other Holmes stories; for example, his respectful appellation of Irene Adler as “The Woman” in “A Scandal in Bohemia”)—even if, in the end, he has every reason to believe he will gain the upper hand (as he does in this case—else he would not have been able to display what Watson describes as that “remarkable” ability of “detaching his mind at will” in order to enjoy the art exhibition prior to the trip to the Northumberland Hotel, p. 53). In fact, Holmes relishes matching wits with opponents who can challenge him; in several Holmes stories, we see that he cares little for common, unimaginative criminals. No: Holmes is far happier, far more intellectually stimulated, when he is placed in a contest with, as he says here, “a foeman who is worthy of our steel” (p. 63—and one almost senses that the use of the plural pronoun refers not to himself and Watson, but the “royal we”!)
For all that it reinforces Holmes’ high opinion of himself, however, this chapter also shows us the true friendship and regard in which he holds his confidante and chronicler, Dr. Watson. When he suggests that Sir Henry take “a trusted man” with him to Baskerville Hall (albeit after begging off being that man himself because of a highly important and delicate case in which he is already involved—an explanation of which readers should make a mental note), he commends Watson to Sir Henry: “there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say that more confidently than I” (p. 58). The detective may not always acknowledge it openly, but he knows Watson is much more than (as he said in Chapter 1) “a conductor of [Holmes’ own] light.” The good doctor is a man of practical common sense and also capable of direct action; as Watson himself says, “The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me…” (p. 59). The recommendation that Watson accompany Sir Henry also marks a transition to the next portion of the narrative, in which Watson will be much more directly involved in the action.

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 6 - 10," 
Summary: Holmes urges Watson to report any even possibly relevant fact about the situation at the Baskerville estate back to him. After eliminating the elderly clergyman Desmond, Holmes enumerates those who live at and around Baskerville Hall whom he does consider suspects in Sir Charles’ death: the Barrymores, Dr. Mortimer and his wife, the naturalist Stapleton and his sister, Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and a few other neighbors.” Watson takes a revolver with him. At the platform, Mortimer avers that he and Sir Henry have not been followed again. He says he and the baronet remained together during the previous two days, save for the time Mortimer spent at the Museum of the College of Surgeons and Sir Henry spent in a park (probably Hyde Park, according to Klinger, 462). Sir Henry reports that he never got his other boot back. Holmes urges Sir Henry not to travel the moors alone or at night. The train arrives in Devonshire after only a few hours’ time, and Sir Henry is quite moved by the impressive and imposing sight of Baskerville Hall and its lands, which he has never visited. The company learns that a convict has escaped from the nearby prison at Princetown; armed soldiers keep watch, but the fugitive—the notorious (and possibly insane) Notting Hill murderer, named Selden—has not yet been spotted. Barrymore the butler greets Sir Henry and the others at the Hall, but does announce that he and his wife plan to leave once the Hall’s new master is settled; he says they were greatly devoted to Sir Charles, and cannot stay on comfortably as a result of his death. As Watson tries to sleep that night, he hears the muffled sobbing of a sorrowful woman.
Analysis: This chapter largely serves an atmospheric purpose, further establishing the ominous tone and sense of foreboding that hang over Baskerville Hall and its ill-fated residents as we see the familial estate for the first time, through the eyes of our narrator, Dr. Watson. “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place,” says Sir Henry, in a masterful understatement (p. 72). Indeed, Baskerville Hall and its environs seem to be, in the topography of Conan Doyle’s novel, the one blemish on an otherwise pleasant stretch of the British countryside. “I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his own country,” remarks Watson (p. 66)—but surely very few, and certainly none who did not hail from the Baskerville line, would swear by this estate! We see it first in “fading light” (p. 70)—a symbolic description, also, of the faded glory of the Baskerville line. Watson’s description of the Hall and its setting—evocative of similar literary houses in decay such as Poe’s House of Usher—not only sets a tone of dread and danger, therefore, but also establishes Baskerville Hall as a liminal location—a “thin place” (as ancient Celts termed them), in “limbo” between two worlds or two realities.
In fantasy, the presence of liminal beings in liminal locations often serves to signal that a protagonist will learn a lesson that could not be taught otherwise. In his book How to Read Literature Like a Professor (Quill, 2003), Thomas C. Foster argues that every trip in a work of fiction is really a quest, and that “the real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge” (Foster, p. 3). It is not immediately clear that such is the case in Conan Doyle’s novel, although the hypothesis is not without merit. One might argue, perhaps, that Sir Henry is in a sense “coming of age” as he comes into his own as squire of Baskerville Hall (e.g., “I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father’s death and had never seen the Hall,” p. 66), and is thus recapitulating in some small sense “the hero’s quest.” Watson certainly provides a heroic description of the baronet in this chapter: “as I looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and masterful men” (p. 67; see also his comment in the next chapter that it is Sir Henry’s way to live in “the place of danger,” p. 86). And the good doctor himself might be considered a potential candidate for liminal instruction, although Conan Doyle’s intent with the character seems to have been never much more than to provide an accessible narrator with whom readers could identify as, together, narrator and audience marvel at the deductive prowess of Sherlock Holmes! (It is no small testament to Conan Doyle’s skill, therefore, that The Hound of the Baskervilles—“another adventure of Sherlock Holmes” in which Holmes himself is absent for such a long stretch of the narrative—continually ranks among readers’ favorites in the Sherlockian “canon.”)
 
Thomas Foster also rhetorically asks, “What… does geography mean to a work of literature? Would everything be too much?... Geography in literature can… be revelatory of virtually any element in the work” (Foster, p. 164, 166). This thesis holds true for The Hound of the Baskervilles. The physical setting of Baskerville Hall does more than establish a mood or tone; it also establishes thematic material. Readers can clearly see this dynamic at work as Watson writes of Selden, the escaped murderer who is believed to be running loose among the moors: “Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was lurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his heart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out” (p. 68). To judge from Watson’s words, Selden sounds the equal of such famous, outcast literary monsters as Grendel and Frankenstein’s Creature!
There may yet be hope for the Baskerville house, both the estate and the lineage: Facing the black and forbidding manor house “is a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles’s South African gold” (p. 69). The half-completed new building reperesents all the good that Sir Charles was doing with his wealth, and the good works that Sir Henry has announced his intention to continue. The new and the old are almost in conflict at Baskerville Hall—e.g., the “twin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes” are athwart “more modern wings of black granite” (p. 70); or the contrast between the old dining hall, complete with portraits of a “dim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan knight to the buck of the Regency” and the “modern billiard-room” (p. 72)—all further evidence of the place’s liminal nature. When Sir Henry sees the house, despite the solemn atmosphere, “his dark face [lights] up with a boyish enthusiasm” as he contemplates plans for its improvement (p. 71). (Note how he proposes to bring electricity—British inventor Joseph Swan received a patent for a lightbulb in 1878, a year before Thomas Alva Edison received his patent in America—to the hall “inside of six months,” p. 69—his role, both literally and figuratively, is that of a bringer of light into darkness.) The fact that all is not lost for the Baskervilles lends a sense of urgency to the solution of the mystery. Much is at stake, not only for Sir Henry, but for the disordered, chaotic society around him.
Chapter 7: The Stapletons of Merripit House
Summary: In the morning, Watson learns that the weeping woman he heard the previous night was Mrs. Barrymore, even though her husband denied the fact. He also learns that the telegram Holmes sent from London to Mr. Barrymore was not delivered directly into the butler’s hands, meaning that Barrymore could have been in the city, after all, trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer. While Sir Henry sorts through necessary paperwork, Watson goes walking upon the moor, where he meets the naturalist Jack Stapleton, who lives nearby at Merripit House in the hamlet of Grimpen. His house is an old residence now refurbished for modern living. Mortimer is hunting butterflies, and tells Watson several curious details about the moor, including the fact that the apparently lush and fertile mire around Grimpen is actually a treacherous place, where one “false step… means death to man or beast.” Indeed, the two men watch a pony sucked down into the mire as it attempts to gallop through. The mire has encroached upon the hills over the years, essentially transforming them into highly inaccessible islands; Mortimer, however, goes to the islands to seek his rare specimens. As he is pursuing an especially unusual butterfly, his sister, Beryl Stapleton, approaches Watson and, thinking the doctor is Sir Henry, urges him to return to London as soon as possible. Jack returns and introduces the two; later, Beryl meets Watson on the road back to Baskerville Hall, asking him to forget her warning, which Watson is understandably loathe to do. Beryl tells Watson that she believes in the curse of the Hound, and cannot understand why Sir Henry wishes to place himself in danger. Watson cannot ascertain from Beryl why she could not tell him this in her brother’s hearing; she refuses to elaborate, and returns to Merripit House quickly, before she can be missed.
Analysis: Conan Doyle introduces two new characters in this chapter, Jack and Beryl Stapleton. Mentioned earlier (see Ch. 2, p. 29), Jack Stapleton is a naturalist, as were many well-educated men of means in the Victorian era: not a formally trained scientist as we understand that distinction today, but one well versed in such natural sciences as botany and zoology. Jack was formerly a teacher, but a “serious epidemic” claimed the lives of three boys in his school, causing it to close and “irretrievably swallow[ing] up” much of Jack’s investment in the institution (p. 84). He relates this history in a remarkably casual way; Conan Doyle may be attempting to plant a seed of doubt in readers’ minds, as any good mystery writer does. Part of the author’s task is to cast the gloom of suspicion upon as many characters as possible, heightening suspense and keeping readers guessing about the solution of the mystery. (Note also how, in this chapter, the butler Barrymore engages in suspicious behavior, denying that his wife was crying the night before, even though Watson sees for himself that she was. This fact causes Watson to reflect upon Barrymore’s reliability: “It was he who had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had only his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man’s death,” p. 75).
Jack Stapleton makes repeated references to the unusual nature of the location of Baskerville Hall. He expresses surprise that Sir Henry would “bury himself in a place of this kind” (p. 77)—a striking choice of language, given that Sir Charles has only recently been literally buried! He calls the moor a “queer” and “uncanny place altogether” (p. 81), and states—in a knowing way, which may also raise readers’ suspicions—that Watson “will find some very singular points” about it (p. 82). Yet Jack also seems to enjoy the locale in a way that his sister clearly does not. Even though the moor is “hard to know” (p. 79), Jack knows his way to and from the islands in “the great Grimpen Mire… a bad place” (p. 80). He actively dissuades Watson (who, in several of the Sherlock Holmes stories, establishes himself also as active and witty) from seeking to reach the islands himself—perhaps another point of suspicion? Why does Jack spend so much time upon the moor—solely to add to his impressive butterfly collection?  And why does he react so casually to the drowning of the pony in the mire? As Watson points out, the sight of the horse’s death “turned [him] cold with horror, but [Jack’s] nerves seemed to be stronger” (p. 80). Jack’s reaction to the dead pony is not, in fact, unlike his reaction to his three dead students: author Frederick Ryan-Brown questions how Jack could possibly have felt “simultaneously… uninterested and privileged, and suggests that, based on how the reader eventually comes to understand the character, Stapleton’s first thought is far truer than the second” (Klinger, 485). Certainly, readers may conclude there is more to Jack than meets the eye—as, indeed, is the case with the moor itself. We learn in this chapter that the moor and the Grimpen mire are places where appearances can be deceiving. The mire, for instance, looks to Watson like “a rare place for a gallop” (p. 79), but it is actually treacherous ground. What appear to be “sheep-pens” (p. 81) are actually the huts of Neolithic ancestors (another example of the moor’s liminality, “mired,” as it were, in between the past and the present; according to Klinger, “Baedeker’s Great Britain (1894) characterizes the moors as abounding in menhirs, stone circles, and ‘other relics of the ancient Brtions,” p. 482).
 
Altogether, the chapter compounds the mystery surrounding Baskerville Hall. Readers may feel as disoriented as Watson: “Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track” (p. 86). To his credit, however, Watson does not shrink from the mystery in the way that Sir Henry seems to. By the light of the morning, the baronet is able to dismiss his misgivings about Baskerville Hall as the effect of being “tired with [the] journey and chilled by [the] drive,” and he dismisses the sound of Mrs. Barrymore’s weeping as a dream; Watson, in contrast, steadfastly maintains, “I heard it distinctly” (p. 74). The good doctor may be confused at the moment, but readers nevertheless have reason to believe that Sherlock Holmes’ confidence in him as his proxy has been well-placed.
Chapter 8: First Report of Dr. Watson
Summary: Watson writes a letter to Holmes, reporting that Selden, the escaped convict, is believed to have left the area entirely. He also reports that Sir Henry has begun to express an attraction to Miss Beryl Stapleton—a development that appears to cause her brother, Jack, some consternation. Watson has also now seen the yew alley, the scene of Sir Charles’ death, for himself; and has met Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall, an elderly man who spends most of his time filing lawsuits and surveying the moor with a telescope. Sir Henry has asked Barrymore about Holmes’ test telegram from London: Barrymore confirms that the message was not delivered into his hands; he claims his wife—whom Watson thinks aloof and puritanical—brought it to him and relayed his answer. Watson concludes his letter by reporting that, around two o’clock that morning, he saw Barrymore walking stealthily through the corridors and peering out the window onto the moor, impatiently.
Analysis: This chapter is presented as a letter from Watson to Holmes. There is some irony in the fact that much of Watson’s letter is concerned with matters of the heart, as he tells Holmes of Sir Henry’s “considerable interest in our fair neighbour,” Miss Stapleton (p. 90). Readers may wonder whether Holmes would have observed this development as keenly as Watson does: the good doctor notes, “From the first moment that [Sir Henry] saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual” (p. 91). Watson is also able to discern Jack Stapleton’s disapproval of the baronet’s romantic attentions to his sister, as well as to surmise an explanation: “He is much attached to her… and would lead a lonely life without her” (p. 91). Although readers cannot know whether Holmes would or would not have ascertained these affairs of the heart for himself, they can have no doubt that, know that he knows of them, he will take them into consideration. Holmes’ confidence in sending Watson to Baskerville Hall in his stead is thus further justified. The doctor is developing his own “theories” about the “secret business going on in this house of gloom” (pp. 96, 95); and, indeed, has devised a plan of action in cooperation with Sir Henry to test them; but he, as well as the readers, know that the ultimate solution must await Holmes’ arrival.
Only briefly introduced in this chapter, Frankland nevertheless makes a striking impression, thanks to Watson’s economical but well-chosen words of description: “he fights for the mere pleasure of fighting” (p. 92). How true such motivation seems to be behind so much litigious action, not only in Victorian Britain but also in modern America! Frankland is in Watson’s view a comic character, for his continued engagement in lawsuits seems a reckless waste of his fortune and results in equal amounts praise and disapprobation for him: Frankland “applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit” (p. 93). (According to Klinger, “there was no village of Fernworthy, [but] there was a substantial farming district of that name” in Dartmoor, p. 494.) Readers may also infer that Frankland will prove important for his ongoing observation of the moor, looking for the escaped convict Selden—Watson’s theory that the criminal must be far away, due to lack of food on the moor, seems overly optimistic (and Conan Doyle would not be making so much of the fact were it not to figure into the story at some future point, in some way). Readers will also note that Frankland is one of two people we see watching the moor: the other, of course, is Barrymore, whom Watson secretly spies “crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass… as he stared out into the blackness of the moor… watching intently” (p. 95). It is a suitably Gothic image for this tale of suspense and suggested supernatural mystery—as well as, of course, a potential clue in its ultimate resolution.
Chapter 9: Second Report of Dr. Watson: The Light upon the Moor
Summary: Watson and Sir Henry plan to follow Barrymore on his nocturnal walk that evening, in order to discovery why he stands at the particular window he does, the window “which commands the nearest outlook upon the moor.” In the meantime, Sir Henry asks Watson to leave him alone as he goes down to the moor to visit Miss Stapleton. Watson, torn between his desire to respect his new friend’s privacy and his promise to Holmes to not leave the baronet alone, follows from a distance. Thus he sees Sir Henry and Beryl Stapleton’s animated conversation (which he cannot hear) interrupted by Jack Stapleton, brandishing his butterfly net. After more apparently heated conversation, brother and sister leave Sir Henry. Watson reveals himself to the baronet, who tells him that he was in the midst of proposing marriage to Miss Stapleton. Her brother objected, expressing anger with both his sister and Sir Henry. The baronet cannot understand why Beryl’s brother should possibly object to the match. That afternoon, however, Jack Stapleton visits the Hall, explaining that he is simply upset at the thought of losing his sister to marriage after so many years of togetherness. He asks Sir Henry to wait three months before pursuing any more talk of marriage, in order to give him time to acclimate to the idea. Sir Henry agrees.
For the next two nights, he and Watson carry out their plan of tracking Barrymore to the window. On the first night, they hear no sound of the butler; on the second, however, they do follow him to the window. They watch as Barrymore holds a candle to it, and see a corresponding, answering light on the moor. When they confront Barrymore, they learn from him and his wife that Eliza Barrymore’s younger brother is none other than the escaped convict, Selden. They had taken him in and cared for him prior to Sir Henry’s arrival at Baskerville Hall; once Sir Henry returned, they arranged to signal him privately, every other night, to see if he needed food and provisions. If he answered their signal, they would set out goods for him. Watson and Sir Henry resolve to capture Selden and turn him in to the authorities. When they reach the light on the moor, however—it is a candle so set in the cleft of a tor (an outcropping of rock formed by weathering, usually located at or near a hill’s summit) that it can only be seen on a direct line-of-sight from the window at which Barrymore stood—they are not able to catch Selden, although they see (presumably) the criminal’s “evil yellow face… all seamed and scored with vile passions.” Selden outruns the two men. They hear a terrible crying sound, the sound Watson has heard once previously and which residents of the moor believe to be the baying of the Baskerville Hound; furthermore, Watson alone catches a glimpse of a man atop the tor a taller man than Selden, standing silent and still. Before Watson can point this mysterious figure out to Sir Henry, the stranger is gone. Watson again writes to Holmes, relating all these events to him and urging him to come quickly to Baskerville Hall.
Analysis: As he concludes his second epistle to Holmes, Watson confidently asserts, “We are certainly making some progress” (p. 115). Certainly, several mysteries at Baskerville Hall seem to have been explained. But readers of the detective genre in general and of Sherlock Holmes stories in particular may well intuit that Watson’s confidence in his own investigative abilities may yet prove premature. The good doctor asks Holmes to “congratulate” him, “and tell me that I have not disappointed you as agent” (p. 105). And Holmes may not “regret” sending Watson (p. 105)—yet Watson may discover, as he did in the first chapter, that Holmes values Watson for reasons other than those Watson would presume! It is unlikely, for example, that the detective will be content with Jack Stapleton’s explanation of his behavior toward Sir Henry and his sister, even though Watson and Sir Henry accept this explanation straightaway. Even so, Watson’s work will prove valuable in providing Holmes with “all the facts”—as the doctor himself realizes: he “feel[s] that it is best” that Holmes “select for [him]self those [facts] which will be of most service” (p. 115). Sir Henry’s question regarding his and Watson’s outing in pursuit of Selden—“I say, Watson… what would Holmes say to this?” (p. 111)—in some respect applies to Watson’s entire account of the matter. What would Holmes say? Readers can expect that he will see the same facts as Watson, as well as many others, and yet arrive at different and more fully correct conclusions.
Jack Stapleton’s account of his emotional state, as well as his request that Sir Henry wait three months before officially courting Beryl, rings a bit hollow (not least because, sad to say, it is an explanation Watson had already constructed as a possibility, in his first letter to Holmes-cf. p. 91). More convincing—again, in no small part because it comes as a surprise, and since they have no obvious incentive to manufacture such a tale—is the Barrymores’ revelation that Eliza is Selden’s sister. Conan Doyle has thus established two unusual brother-sister relationships in the novel: Jack and Beryl Stapleton, and John and Eliza Barrymore. These relationships, each one conflicted in some way—Jack’s displeasure at Sir Henry’s attentions to Beryl; the strain John and Eliza bear and the risk they run in supporting their brother who “dragged [their family] name in the dirt” (p. 109)—reinforce the novel’s preoccupation with the influence of family and the inescapable power of lineage, which is, after all, what Sir Henry is reckoning with, as well. The baronet, Watson reports, is sparing no expense to refurbish the Hall and thus “restore the grandeur of his family” (p. 99). Restoring family fortunes—both literal and metaphorical—are emerging as one of the novel’s major thematic concerns.
Regarding Selden’s physical appearance as described by Watson, Klinger notes, “Watson seems… to embrace the popular conception… that criminals could be identified by certain physical characteristics” (p. 515). The irony is that this prevailing medical-physiological theory of the day is no more sound than Mortimer’s devotion to phrenology—or, indeed, than the commoners’ superstitious belief in the Baskervilles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
 
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
 
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 11 - 15," 
Summary: Watson questions Laura Lyons, who reluctantly tells him that she wrote to Sir Charles on the day of his death. Persecuted by her husband and her father (Frankland), she was seeking further assistance toward her financial independence (she has also been receiving help from Stapleton). Mrs. Lyons insists, however, that she never went to Baskerville Hall that day; she claims to have received help from elsewhere, and planned to commence divorce proceedings against her husband, a claim Watson intends to verify—although he must admit to himself that her story hangs together. He still intuits, however, that she may be hiding some truth from him. The doctor then turns his attention to seeking the man he saw on the Black Tor; he receives unexpected help from Frankland, who claims to have seen the messenger boy who takes Selden his food. Watson knows the truth: the boy is supplying food to the unknown man upon the moor, and not to Selden (who has been supplied by the Barrymores). Frankland shows Watson the boy through his telescope, as he is delivering one of his bundles. Watson goes to the same old stone hut as the boy. It is empty at the moment but shows signs of being recently inhabited, chief among them a surprising note: “Dr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.” Watson fears that this stranger is pursuing him rather than Sir Henry until the hut’s inhabitant returns, revealing himself to be none other than Sherlock Holmes.
Analysis: Poor Dr. Watson—his efforts are admirable, but he will never be able to outshine Holmes! Which is, of course, only as it should be: having Watson as an affable foil to the often abrasive but indisputably brilliant Holmes is the chief way in which Conan Doyle characterizes his most famous character. We see Holmes through Watson’s admiring eyes, and thus come to admire him ourselves. Thus we can forgive the master detective his dramatic entrance, in which he has some fun at Watson’s expense. Holmes’ arrival even has a slight air of justice about it, for Watson has earlier speculated, “It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run [the man on the tor] to earth where my master had failed” (p. 132). Were Watson to best Holmes, things would be even more out of joint than they already are! Conan Doyle’s use of “master” language may seem odd, smacking as it does of Victorian British class structure; it implies that Holmes and Watson are not equals. While they are equal in a socio-economic sense (they do, after all, share the flat at Baker Street), they are not equal in their deductive ability. And so we also likely feel some of Watson’s relief that Holmes has, at last, arrived—for Watson has been effectively stymied in his own detecting work: “Once again,” he laments after his interview with Laura Lyons, “I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission” (p. 131). For all these reasons, then, readers may fairly anticipate that Holmes’ arrival on the scene marks the beginning of a “re-ordering” of the disordered social world of the novel.
The marital status of Laura Lyons reflects some of the social disorder with which Victorian society was grappling. As Klinger points out, “Victorian society had little regard for divorced (or separated) women” (p. 538), and so both Watson’s and the reader’s sympathies for Laura Lyons are to be assumed as she faces the predicament of dealing with an abusive father on the one hand and an abusive husband on the other. Nonetheless, Mortimer has previously stated that he does not believe Mrs. Lyons to be completely blameless, and so some prejudice toward her has already been injected into the narrative. Certainly, Watson’s suspicions about her are not completely allayed after his interview with her. In the original manuscript of this chapter (Chapter 11 is the only portion of the work, aside from single pages, still known to exist in manuscript form), Watson’s suspicions are voiced somewhat more strongly: “Either she was an accomplished actor and a deep conspirator, or Barrymore had misread the letter, or the letter was a forgery…” (p. 539). As the text stands, however, we are left with Watson’s grudging conclusion that Mrs. Lyons’ “story hung coherently together, and all my questions were unable to shake it” (p. 131). (For his own part, Conan Doyle proved an advocate of divorce law reformation, seeking to improve the ease with which women could be granted a divorce, not just a separation.)
Chapter 12: Death on the Moor
Summary: Once Watson has recovered from the shock of the detective’s self-revelation, Holmes explains that he has not, in fact, been occupied with a blackmail case in London; he has been secretly investigating the Baskerville case on his own. (The boy who has been supplying him is Cartwright, from the telegraph office in London.) Watson tells Holmes about his interview with Laura Lyons; Holmes informs Watson that the woman is intimate with Jack Stapleton, and that Beryl Stapleton is, in fact, Jack’s wife and not his sister. Holmes did not know that Lyons was planning to divorce her husband; he surmises that she planned on marring Stapleton, whom she did not know was already married. Holmes has also concluded that Jack was their mysterious, bearded pursuer in the city, and that Beryl sent Sir Henry the cut-and-paste letter of warning. Holmes and Watson hear a terrible scream; they discover a corpse with an expression of terror on its face whom they initially believe to be Sir Henry, based on its clothing, broken upon a rocky ridge. Upon closer examination, however, they discover that the dead man is Selden. Watson recalls how the Barrymores had given Sir Henry’s old clothes to Selden as part of their support for the fugitive. Holmes deduces that the hound—a real hound, not the Hound of legend—must have been trained to track Sir Henry based upon an item of his clothing (likely the boot stolen from Sir Henry at the hotel in London). Jack Stapleton approaches Holmes and Watson and expresses shock at Selden’ death. He claims to have been concerned for Sir Henry because he had invited the baronet to come to the Stapletons’ home that night, and he never arrived; when he heard the screams, he says, he grew worried.
Analysis: This chapter provides some additional insights into Holmes’ characters, showing us as it does the detective’s obvious enjoyment of having befuddled Watson with his unexpected appearance. Watson describes Holmes’ voice as “cold, incisive, [and] ironical” (p. 139), adjectives that could as easily describe the man himself as well as his manner of speaking! And yet perhaps not entirely cold: although surely Holmes is pleased with himself at having surprised the good doctor, he is also concerned (albeit to a lesser extent) with his colleague’s feelings. When Watson complains that he thinks he should “have deserved better [treatment] at [Holmes’] hands,” Holmes assures Watson that his “zeal and intelligence” while on his own have “been invaluable” (p. 141). Knowing that Watson is “rather raw over the deception” (p. 141), Holmes praises him—not, it seems, insincerely—and seems genuinely pleased to see “the shadow rise from [Watson’s] face” as a result (p. 142). Thus, while Holmes does remain primarily concerned with his own methods and the mystery at hand, readers see that he is not completely without human feeling and sensitivities. They are simply not his normal modus operandi! As he tells Stapleton at the chapter’s end, “[a]n investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours” (p. 150)—nor, it seems, undue emotional material, except insofar as it may explain the motives of those involved in a case. (For example, he does understand that Laura Lyons may be more forthcoming when she “is undeceived” of the notion that Beryl Stapleton is Jack’s sister, p. 144). The chapter also shows us that Holmes is not infallible (merely nearly so!). He makes the same mistake Watson does when finding the body upon the moor: he initially identifies it as Sir Henry simply because the corpse wears the baronet’s clothing. Nor is Holmes completely unflappable: when he and Watson hear Selden’s dying screams, Watson notes that Holmes, “the man of iron, was shaken to the soul” (p. 145).
Chapter 13: Fixing the Nets
Summary: Holmes instructs Watson to keep all knowledge of the hound that tracked Selden a secret from Sir Henry, in order that the baronet may be better prepared to face dinner with the Stapletons the next evening. Holmes has a plan that hinges upon Sir Henry’s attendance. At Baskerville Hall, Watson tells the Barrymores of Selden’s death; the husband seems relieved, but his wife, Selden’s sister, weeps with grief. While speaking with Sir Henry, Holmes takes notice of the portraits of his ancestors, including a portrait of Hugo Baskerville, who seems, to Holmes’ eyes, “a quiet, meek-mannered man enough,” and not the reprobate of legend whose exploits supposedly brought the curse of the Hound upon his line. When Sir Henry leaves, Holmes points out to Watson how much Stapleton resembles Hugo. Holmes concludes that Stapleton must be, in fact, a member of the Baskerville family, scheming to take Sir Henry’s inheritance. The next morning, Holmes announces that he and Watson will be returning to London prior to the dinner engagement with the Stapletons. Holmes insists that Sir Henry relay the message to the Stapletons that he and Watson hope to return soon, and also to drive to Merripit House but then announce his intention to walk home across the moor, alone, after dinner. Sir Henry does not understand why Holmes is reversing his previous counsel, but agrees to do so. Later, in Coombe Tracey, Holmes instructs young Cartwright to send a telegram in Holmes’ name to Sir Henry, requesting the baronet return a dropped pocketbook by registered mail to Baker Street. When Cartwright returns from the telegram office, he brings a wire from Inspector Lestrade for Holmes, indicating that the police officer is on his way with an unsigned warrant. Holmes and Watson visit Laura Lyons, telling her the truth about Stapleton and learning from her that Jack Stapleton’s dictated the letter she sent to Sir Charles, but also telling her not to keep the appointment with him (protesting that he alone wanted to give her financial assistance, that they might be married).
Analysis: This chapter’s events and revelations contribute to readers’ sense that we are approaching the dénouement, chief among them the fact that Stapleton is, in fact, a Baskerville. This identity supplies him with a motive for mischief and murder, as Watson realizes: “designs upon the succession” to Baskerville Hall (p. 156). Laura Lyons’ information, too, clarifies matters: Stapleton was arranging a way to lure Sir Charles to a secret meeting, a meeting at which he could take action against him. As Holmes says, “Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins away in front of us” (p. 162). His confidence, indeed, borders on hubris, as befits his character: “I shall soon be in the position of being able to put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular and sensational crimes of modern times” (p. 162). It only borders on that overweening pride, however, because, of course, Holmes will be proven correct (in fact, within the narrative’s world, the very existence of the story bears out his judgment—else Watson would not be reporting it!). This lesson is one that Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard has long since taken to heart. Lestrade is a recurring chacter in Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes “canon.” At his initial meeting with Holmes (in the very first story, A Study in Scarlet), he did indeed express “scorn” at Holmes’ theories; now, however, he has “learned a good deal” and is “reverential” toward the detective, eager to assist him (p. 162).
One notable passage in this chapter preserves the humanity of Selden, the dead criminal, as his sister, Mrs. Barrymore, grieves for him: “To all the world”—and, indeed, to Watson, when he spotted the escaped convict on the moor—Selden “was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he always remained the little willful boy of her own girlhood, the child who had clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to mourn him” (p. 153). Watson’s words are a touching reminder of the common humanity uniting all people. (Another reminder may be seen in Holmes’ laughter, ominous though it is for such criminals! Watson remarks that Holmes’ laughter is rare, and, indeed, it seems to be so. According to Klinger [p. 27], one Sherlock Holmes enthusiast has found 65 instances of a laugh and 31 instances of a “chuckle” in all 60 Holmes stories!)
Chapter 14: The Hound of the Baskervilles
Summary: Holmes, Watson and Lestrade return to Dartmoor and walk through a fog-covered night upon the moors to Merripit House, where a concealed Watson observes Sir Henry and Jack Stapleton alone, conversing over cigars, coffee and wine after their dinner. Watson watches as Stapleton leaves the room and goes to an out-house which he enters and from which Watson hears “a curious scuffling noise.” He rejoins Sir Henry, and Watson reports what he has seen to the detective and the police inspector. The three wait, in suspense, for Sir Henry to begin his way back to Baskerville Hall. When he finally does so, they see a terrifying hound, apparently glowing with unearthly fire, chasing the baronet. Holmes and Watson fire revolvers at the beast, but not before it attacks Sir Henry, going for his throat. Empting his gun’s chamber into the hound, Holmes kills it before it can kill Sir Henry. The animal is a bred combination of bloodhound and mastiff, its mouth and eyes having been made up with phosphorous. Upon entering Merripit House, the men find Mrs. Stapleton bound and gagged; when they free her, she tells them that Jack has fled to a tin mine on an island in the middle of Grimpen Mire. The dense, rolling fog prevents Holmes and his party from giving chase. The next morning, they discover Sir Henry’s missing boot—which Stapleton used to put the hound on the baronet’s scent and then flung away as he fled, having heard Holmes’ and Watson’s pistol shots—and traces of Stapleton’s presence in the tin mine where he housed the ferocious animal, but no sign of Stapleton himself. He is presumed to have sunk deep into the miry bog.
Analysis: The penultimate chapter of Conan Doyle’s novel is a classic of suspense. As previously, the author here again uses his story’s setting for its fullest effect, creating an appropriately tense atmosphere: The fog “was drifting slowly in our direction… [Holmes] muttered impatiently as he watched its sluggish drift” (p. 165); “So as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it… that dense white sea, with the moon silvering on its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on” (p. 166). Further tension is created by Sir Henry’s delay at leaving Merripit House: “the baronet looked pale and distrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened moor was weighing heavily upon his mind” (p. 165). Both elements create the sense that time is standing still, and this narrative delay increases the suspense to the fullest possible degree before it is resolved. Additionally, this chapter is remembered for its remarkable revelation of the hound: “A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes have ever seen” (p. 167). Watson’s initial descriptions of the beast—“Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in flickering flame” (p. 167)—create a kind of cognitive dissonance in the first-time reader: could this actually be the supernatural monster long feared by the Baskervilles and their neighbors on the moor? No; we soon learn that the animal has been bred for size and ferocity, and made-up with a “cunning preparation” of phosphorous material (p. 168). Nevertheless, for the moment in which the hound attacks Sir Henry, readers will have to concede that Watson (thus, of course, Conan Doyle!) has achieved the stated aim of making them “share those dark fears and vague surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a manner” (p. 171). The novel thus illustrates the literary principle of catharsis: a cleansing, purifying emotional release, intended to refresh the spirit. Indeed, Holmes’ words to Mrs. Stapleton (whom her abusive husband has, in cruel irony, treated no better than one of his butterfly specimens) hint at catharsis—the re-ordering a disordered world, both social and emotional—as one of the book’s concerns (a concern it has in common with much detective fiction): “If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so atone” (p. 171).  The novel’s social world is now set right. The mystery of the hound has been explained in a rational manner; Sir Henry’s life has been spared (indeed, we learn that after world travel the young baronet becomes again “the hale, hearty man that he had been,” p. 171); and, although Stapleton is not made to stand trial for his crime of murdering Sir Charles and Selden, and attempting to murder Sir Henry, he nonetheless faces a certain poetic justice in meeting his fate on the moor: “Somewhere in the heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is forever buried” (p. 173). (Of course, as some Holmes enthusiasts have pointed out, it may be “premature to announce Stapleton’s death”—see Klinger, p. 600—as any good mystery fan knows, no one can safely be presumed dead without a corpse!)
Chapter 15: A Retrospection
Summary: Some time later, Watson and Holmes review the facts of the Baskerville case. The detective gives final clarification to several points. Stapleton was the son of Sir Charles Baskerville’s brother Rodger, who had fled to South America. After having embezzled public money, Stapleton moved, with his bride Beryl Garcia, to England, where, having changed his name, he established his school (the one true point of his biography that Stapleton had revealed to Watson). Changing his name for the last and final time, he and Beryl moved to Devonshire. Learning that only Sir Charles and Sir Henry stood in the way of his family fortune, he made plans to kill them, using his wife as a decoy and a hidden hound, disguised to look like the Hound of legend, as his weapon. He won the affections of Laura Lyons, whose unkept appointment (at Stapleton’s arranging) with Sir Charles gave Stapleton the chance to unleash the hound upon him. The hound ran on the grass, leaving no tracks behind and thus contributing to the suggestion of a supernatural event. Now turning his attention to Sir Henry, Stapleton took his wife to London with him—not trusting her enough to leave her alone—where he shadowed Mortimer and Sir Henry in his bearded disguise—and where Beryl sent her warning letter to the young baronet, fearing what her husband might do. Stapleton bribed the hotel staff in order to obtain an article of Sir Henry’s clothing, the boot, that the hound could use to track the heir. (While Stapleton was in the city, he left the hound in the care of Anthony, an elderly servant who had been connected with Stapleton for several years, since his stay in South America.) Holmes then conducted his secret surveillance of Stapleton, claiming a non-existent blackmailing case demanded his attention; when ready, he revealed himself to Watson, and the case entered its final phase. When Stapleton learned that Beryl knew of Selden’s death and held him responsible, he beat and bound her so that she would have no chance to warn Sir Henry. Holmes regrets having felt compelled to use Sir Henry as “bait,” but takes comfort in the fact that the baronet will recover in time. The case thus satisfactorily resolved, Holmes and Watson prepare for dinner and an evening at the opera.
Analysis: The novel’s final chapter admirably accomplishes the purpose of detective fiction, mentioned earlier: of putting a disordered society back to order, of restoring ease to a dis-eased world. Much of the information Holmes covers is, of course, already known to careful readers by this point (although there is some new information included, such as the introduction of Stapleton’s servant Anthony, and the speculations about how Stapleton would have claimed Baskerville Hall had his plot succeeded). Nonetheless, logical and aesthetic gratification is to be found in Holmes “kindly giv[ing Watson] a sketch of the course of events” (p. 175). The summary gives the readers a final opportunity to put all the details of the case in order, to distinguish between true clues and false leads (for instance, the litigious character of Frankland emerges as largely irrelevant, save for his role in exacerbating his daughter Laura’s plight), and thus either reassuring themselves that they have successfully matched wits with Holmes (and, by extension, the author), or—more likely Conan Doyle’s intent—having one more chance to marvel at his abilities. Holmes speaks with the barest possible amount of false modesty—e.g., “That Sir Henry should have been exposed to this [trauma] is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the case,” pp. 181-82; and, in fact, some readers have concurred: “Ian McQueen chides Holmes for not having anticipated the overwhelming possibility of sudden fog, and for taking his oversight lightly,” Klinger, p. 610); but on the whole it is clear that Holmes is satisfied with his investigation—as is evident in the fact that, by the time Watson inquires about it at the chapter’s outset, Holmes has already moved on to more pressing matters: “the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us” (p. 175). And although he indirectly thanks Watson again for his role (particularly the information that Stapleton used to be a headmaster), he stresses, “I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations” (p. 181). It is thus both curious and ironic that the great detective, who so clearly views himself as self-sufficient, should be forever linked in the popular imagination with the man he once called “my Boswell” (“A Study in Scarlet”): readers cannot think of Sherlock Holmes without also thinking of the character through whose writings (ostensibly) we come to know him, Dr. John Watson. The two are an inseparable pair, and thus it is pleasing to see them planning to enjoy a night in London society together as the book draws to its close. That detail, too, reinforces the satisfactory sense of proper resolution to all things, that sense of well-being and order that is one of the enduring appeals of the Sherlock Holmes “canon.” As author and Holmes enthusiast Vincent Starrett wrote in his poem, “221B”:
Here dwell together still two men of note
Who never lived and so can never die:
How very near they seem, yet how remote
That age before the world went all awry.
But still the game’s afoot for those with ears
Attuned to catch the distant view-halloo:
England is England yet, for all our fears–
Only those things the heart believes are true.
A yellow fog swirls past the window-pane
As night descends upon this fabled street:
A lonely hansom splashes through the rain,
The ghostly gas lamps fail at twenty feet.
Here, though the world explode, these two survive,
And it is always eighteen ninety-five.
elief teѢlles’ hell-hound (of which more in the next chapter). Conan Doyle’s novel thus seems to have a thematic interest, at least from a modern perspective, of the way preconceived ideas can limit our perception of reality.
Chapter 10: Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson
Summary: At breakfast, Barrymore implores Sir Henry and Watson to pursue Selden no more, stating that Selden will shortly be leaving the country, heading to South America where he will trouble England no more. Sir Henry agrees not to inform the police of Selden’s location. In gratitude, Barrymore reveals that, the morning of his death, Sir Charles had received a letter from a woman whose initials were “L.L.” and who lived in nearby Coombe Tracey. The letter-writer asked Sir Charles to meet her at the yew-alley gate that evening, and to burn the letter; Barrymore’s wife only later discovered the charred remnant in Sir Charles’ hearth. The next day, Watson visits the tor where he spied the unknown man the night he and Sir Henry chased Selden. He encounters Mortimer, searching for a lost spaniel (whom Watson fears has been absorbed by the Grimpen Mire). Mortimer tells Watson about Laura Lyons, the daughter of the litigious Mr. Frankland. Laura married an artist who deserted her, and her father has practically disowned her—although Mortimer hints that she may not be without blame in these strained relations. He also states that Selden told him of another man on the moor. He does not know who this man is, but he doesn’t believe he is another convict, nor is he police. He knows, from Selden, that this second man has a “lad” who supplies his wants from Coombe Tracy.
Analysis: This chapter is replete with further examples of the “pathetic fallacy”—the use of natural setting to reflect emotional and psychological realities behind the story. Watson, indeed, makes this external-internal connection explicit when describing October 16 as a “dull and foggy day”—referring not only to the physical fog but his own mental fog and “weight of heart”, perplexed by the mystery of Baskerville Hall; cf. also Sir Henry’s “black reaction,” mirroring the gloom of the weather—“…melancholy outside and in” (p. 116). The chapter ends as it begins, with an explicit connection between setting, character, and theme: Watson watches the driving rainstorm and allows it is “a wild night [even] indoors, and what must it be in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which leads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time?” (p. 125). The confused violence of the storm reflects the confusion of Sir Henry and Watson as well as the violence of Selden and his (as yet) unknown confederate. Chaos is reigning supreme (in Western literature, from the Bible on, water and storms routinely symbolize chaos and disorder). Small wonder Watson again wishes Holmes were present (p. 121), as the detective has a way of ordering chaos. In an endearing passage in this chapter, Watson states, “I am certainly developing the wisdom of the serpent”—an allusion to Matthew 10.16, where Jesus instructs his disciples to be “as wise as serpents but as harmless as doves”—“I have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing,” p. 123. Yet even he knows, once more, that he is no match for his friend. Watson resolves “to reach the heart of the mystery” the next day, p. 125, but he will, in the end, be well-intentioned but as “harmless as a dove”!
Watson laments—in yet another example of the pathetic fallacy—“God help those who wander into the great mire now, for even the firm uplands are becoming a morass” (p. 121): a statement not only about the physical location but also about the precarious situation of those, such as Watson, who wander into the “mire” of the Baskerville Hall mystery; and, further, who are confronted by, seemingly, the very grounds of civilized society shifting beneath their feet. This fin de siecle malaise gripped Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) as the era of Victoria ended, and the 19th century gave way to the 20th (appropriately, Queen Victoria died in the year 1900 itself). In 1895, Max Nordau, literary and social critic, described the fin de siecle thus: “The disposition of the times is curiously confused… The prevalent feeling is that of imminent perdition and extinction. Fin de siecle is at once a confession and a complaint… [M]ankind with all its institutions and creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world” (quoted in Bernard Bergonzi, The Early H.G. Wells, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 5). Readers can find traces of this mindset permeating the pages of The Hound of the Baskervilles. As already alluded to, the once-stately, now-in-disrepair Baskerville Hall itself symbolizes this sense of decline. In this chapter, too, we find Watson evoking a classism that will not accord well with the modern era to come: to believe in the superstition of the spectral Hound, he declares with no small measure of self-congratulatory pride, “would be to descend to the level of these poor peasants…” (p. 117). And we are reminded again of the evidence of prehistoric—and, hence, pre-civilized—man around the moor: Selden’s unknown ally lives among “the stone huts where the old folk used to live” (p. 125), a powerful reminder of what many Victorians feared as the encroaching lack of civilization. Further evidence of the Victorian preoccupation with preserving what they perceived as an increasingly fragile society may be found in Watson and Sir Henry’s attitude that, so long as Selden is heading for South America, he does not need to be turned over to authorities. Klinger points out that Watson’s attitude “is reminiscent of the English penal policy of ‘transporation,’ the government program of removal of criminals from England and shipping them to America or the Australian colonies… Both Dr. Watson and the government seem to believe that so long as a criminal is removed from England, it little matters where he or she goes or whether the convict continues in his or her criminal ways” (p. 524). If so, such an attitude reflects a limited worldview of extreme self-interest, an attempt to preserve one’s own comfortable social order rather than engage in true reform of it. As Klinger goes on to point out, “Mrs. Barrymore certainly never suggested that Selden had repented or changed in any way. Sir Henry’s condonation here seems incredible” (p. 525). Less incredible, perhaps, if understood as unwittingly revelatory of fin de siècle malaise. So long as the criminal will not be “in my backyard” (to borrow a modern idiom), all will (purportedly) be well. Sir Henry and Watson are, in effect, washing their hands of the matter of Selden. Whether this decision is wise remains to be seen.

Raskolnikov himself is suffering from acute depression and loathes the company of other people. He is wearing rags and is brooding obsessively on some unnamed subject (his intended crime) as he plods onward to her apartment. The encounter with the old woman is fraught with anxiety and loathing and it becomes evident that he is casing the place.
	Part1, Chapter 2: Raskolnikov proceeds to a dingy bar, where he meets Semion Marmeladov, who strikes up a conversation with him. Amid periodic scoffs and laughter from fellow patrons, Marmeladov recounts his troubled life, including his dismissal from his job and all the ensuing humiliations and abuse his family has experienced as a result of his alcoholism and their poverty. He describes in particular his proud wife Katherine, who works from dusk till dawn to care for her children and his daughter Sonia, who has taken up prostitution to assist the family. Raskolnikov accompanies him home where he sees the painful and poverty-stricken circumstances his family lives in. Katherine attacks the humiliated Marmeladov, who had recently stolen the last money the family had. Raskolnikov secretly leaves them some of his money from the pawnbroker.

Part1, Chapter 3: The next day, Raskolnikov awakes to learn that his landlady, Praskovia Pavlovna, intends to report him to the police for non-payment of rent. He also receives a letter from his mother. The letter describes how Dunia, who was working as a tutor for the Svidrigailov's, was harassed by Mr. Svidrigailov, who was intent on seducing her. Although she rejected his advances, his wife, Martha Petrovna, misinterpreted a conversation she overheard and blamed Dunia. She then spread vicious rumors about Dunia all over town only to realize later that Dunia was innocent. Martha Petrovna then apologizes profusely and visits each home in the area to correct the damage to Dunia's reputation.
	Afterwards, the letter recounts how Dunia received a marriage proposal from Peter Petrovich Luzhin, who had mentioned his interest in marrying a girl from a poor background.
	Part1, Chapter 4: Raskolnikov, upset by his mother's letter, had left his room and is now walking the streets, ruminating. He is convinced that, by marrying Luzhin, his sister is sacrificing herself for her family. The thought fills him with anguish and hopelessness. While still meditating on the situation, he catches sight of a teenage girl who is staggering in the street, probably drunk. Watching her closely is a predatory man, who seems to be following her. Raskolnikov is greatly upset by the predicament and asks a policeman for help. He offers him the last of his money to call a cab for the girl and see her home safely. Suddenly, a change overtakes him and he calls to the policeman to Let it go. Why bother? Despite these words, he still feels depressed and can't help comparing the poor girl's situation to Dunia's. He decides to go to the home of his friend Razumikhin.

Part1, Chapter 5: Raskolnikov opts not to go to Razumikhin's after all and instead goes to a bar, where he has some vodka and then goes to a park and falls asleep. He dreams that he is a child in his hometown, walking with his father through the streets. He observes a peasant trying to force his old mare to pull a heavy wagon full of people. The horse is struggling beneath the peasant's whip and cannot pull the weight at all. The peasant becomes angry and he beats the animal to death while Raskolnikov watches. The boy becomes so distraught that he tears away from his father and runs to the dead horse, throwing his arms around it and weeping. Raskolnikov wakes shaken and disturbed, asking himself whether he will really murder the old pawnbroker woman with an ax. At this moment, while walking through the Hay Market, Raskolnikov overhears a conversation relaying that Lizaveta, the pawnbroker's step-sister, will be out visiting a peddler and his wife at seven o'clock. The text relates that in later remembrance, the coincidence seemed to Raskolnikov like the hand of fate. In other words, the act that he was formerly torn over committing has been decided by a force outside him. This is interesting, because it clashes with Raskolnikov's concept of the extraordinary man who steps over obstacles and takes fate into his own hands. In other words, Raskolnikov is not the extraordinary man he purports to make allowances for.
	Part1, Chapter 6: The story discusses how Raskolnikov had first visited the pawnbroker. The previous winter, a fellow student had suggested he visit her and although he had not gone then, he had recalled her address six weeks ago. On his first visit he had pawned a ring given to him by his sister. He had felt an insurmountable disgust for the old woman upon seeing her for the first time and on the way home from her house a strange thought began taking shape in his mind. He stopped into a restaurant and happened to overhear a conversation between a young officer and a student which voiced his thoughts. They were arguing, in a philosophical sense, about whether it would be morally wrong to murder the old woman, since she was such a vile and despicable person. They went on to describe how Lizaveta was abused by the pawnbroker. Raskolnikov was shocked to hear his own ideas being discussed. Again, his superstition suggested that this was some kind of sign.
	After recalling this conversation, Raskolnikov lies down for a while and then makes preparations for the murder. He attaches a sling to the inside of his coat, wraps up a phony pledge that the pawnbroker will have to fumble with to untie and goes to the kitchen to get an ax. Unexpectedly, the ax is not in its usual spot and he must take one from the janitor's room. He arrives at the pawnbroker's apartment at seven-thirty. He rings three times and is highly anxious by the time she finally unlatches the door.

Part1, Chapter 7: The old woman cautiously opens the door to him, but seems suspicious. As planned, he gives her the pledge to untie and she turns her back to him. Just at the moment when it seems she is about to turn back around to face him, he withdraws the ax and strikes her with the blunt side three times, killing her. He then removes her key ring from her pockets and takes a purse that, along with two crosses, hangs on a string around her neck. He leaves the crosses on her chest and goes to search under her bed for a strongbox. While he is looking through the chest, he finds some jewelry and begins to pocket these pieces as well but suddenly there is the sound of someone walking in the room where the body is. He waits for a moment and then suddenly springs up and rushes into the adjoining room where he sees Lizaveta staring in horror. He immediately murders her with a single blow from the sharp edge of his ax.
	He goes to clean the ax in the kitchen and then is preparing to leave when he hears the sound of people climbing the stairs. Sensing that they are headed for the apartment, Raskolnikov latches the door and crouches behind it, waiting. Two men who have appointments approach the door and ring. At first they are annoyed that the occupants have forgotten their appointments, but then they realize that the door is latched from the inside and that something must be wrong. One leaves to get the janitor and the other waits at the door for a while before getting fed up and leaving also. Now that the coast is clear, Raskolnikov slips out the door and hides in a vacant apartment that is being painted. The men approach with the janitor and head for the apartment. Just as they enter the apartment, which is now unlatched, Raskolnikov hurries out of the building and back to his flat, replacing the ax in the janitor's room and falling onto his couch.
	Part2, Chapter 1: He lies in a troubled semi-slumber for a long time before realizing he should hide his plunder and lock his door. After falling asleep again, he is awakened by Nastasia the maid and the janitor, who gives him a summons. Extremely anxious, weak and unstable, he dresses and walks to the police station. On the way into the building the thought occurs to him to fall on my knees and...tell all. A strong smell of paint is in the air when he arrives in the station, and he finds it nauseating. He is informed that the reason for his summons is that his landlady is suing for unpaid rent. Feeling a sudden rush of relief and joy, he goes into a long explanation of his prior engagement to the landlady's daughter, who died. He is given an I.O.U. to sign and the clerk mentions that he seems ill. The thought again occurs to him to confess. At this moment, he overhears the officers discussing the murder and he collapses in a faint. When he comes to, he worries that they are suspicious of him and runs home to prepare for a search of his premises.

Part2, Chapter 2: He hides the stolen items beneath a rock in a vacant lot. When he realizes that he has successfully hidden them, another wave of joy passes through him, but it is soon replaced with hopelessness and disgust for everything around him. He finds himself at his friend Razumikhin's apartment and enters in a state of near-delirium. He realizes, after a feeble attempt to converse, that there is no one in the whole wide world he could effectively meet at this moment face to face. He rejects Razumikhin's efforts to provide him with some lessons for pay and leaves.
	Raskolnikov then wanders through the streets and at one point is given some money by someone mistaking him for a poor beggar (his clothes are rags). He then returns home and dreams that one of the policeman is beating the landlady.
	Part2, Chapter 3: After days spent in fevered delirium and illness, Raskolnikov awakes to discover Nastasia and a tradesman, whom he does not know, at his bedside. Razumikhin, who has been caring for him, enters the room. The tradesman presents him with thirty-five rubles which his mother has sent. Razumikhin takes some of the money and goes to buy new clothes for Raskolnikov. In the meantime, Razumikhin has also succeeded in currying the landlady's favor, a feat which he declares required little effort. The chapter ends with the entrance of Zosimov.

Part 2, Chapter 4: Zosimov is a doctor and friend of Razumikhin. When he and Razumikhin begin discussing the murders, Raskolnikov turns away from them as he lies on his couch and faces the wall, studying the wallpaper. Razumikhin and Zosimov heatedly argue over whether the painters could be suspects in the crime. Razumikhin strongly believes they could not have committed it, since they were behaving so jovially immediately following the murder. Suddenly a strange man enters the room.
	Part 2, Chapter 5: The man turns out to be Peter Petrovich Luzhin, Dunia's fianc�. He is stiff and awkward in his greeting and is met with hostility from Raskolnikov, who suspects (rightly) that he is out to stroke his vanity by marrying a poor woman. He is well-dressed and fresh-scrubbed, in contrast to the squalor of the students' appearance and Raskolnikov's living conditions. Luzhin makes an embarrassing attempt to flatter the youth of today, but is met with disagreement and contempt by the young men (Luzhin is 45). Raskolnikov asks Luzhin if it is true that you told your bride...how glad you were that she was a beggar...because it's more profitable saving a wife from beggary--you can lord it over her and remind her she's in your debt! Luzhin is incensed that his words have been twisted and realizes that Raskolnikov was told about this by his mother. Raskolnikov tells Luzhin to go to hell and demands that he leave. He then tells his friends to go as well, wanting to be alone.

Part 2, Chapter 6: As soon as he is left alone, he dresses in his new clothes and goes out. He ends up in a tavern, where he asks the waiter for tea and the last five days' worth of newspapers. He spots an officer, named Zamiotov, who was at the police station when he fainted. Zamiotov sits down next to him and strikes up conversation. Raskolnikov cannot resist taunting him, hinting that he may know something of the murder, that he may even be the murderer. Zamiotov grows increasingly uncomfortable and finally Raskolnikov asks And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta? Zamiotov turns white and asks if it is possible. At this, Raskolnikov responds, You believed me, didn't you? He leaves Zamiotov who is now deep in thought.
	On the way out of the tavern, he runs into Razumikhin, who has come looking for him. Razumikhin tries to persuade Raskolnikov to come to a party that is going on at his house (he is extremely worried about Raskolnikov). Raskolnikov protests, telling him to stop bothering him and leave him alone, that he does not want Razumikhin's favors. Raskolnikov then proceeds straight to a bridge, where he sees a woman throw herself into the water. He understands that he had been contemplating the same act. After witnessing her rescue, he wanders off and finds himself at the pawnbroker's apartment. It is empty and being repainted and he asks the painters about the blood stains from the murder. He also rings the doorbell. His questions cause a stir and when they ask him what he wants, he suggests they come with him to the police station and they'll find out. No one follows him and when he reaches the crossroads, there is a crowd standing around. At this point, he makes a definite decision to go to the police.
	Part 2, Chapter 7: The crowd is gathered around a man who has been run over by a carriage and is gravely injured. He recognizes the stranger as Marmeladov and pays to have him carried home. When the crowd enters with the dying man, Katherine Ivanovna is frail and sick from consumption and the children are in rags. Katherine is stricken with grief and Raskolnikov goes to comfort her, telling her he'll pay Marmeladov's expenses. He then finds a towel and begins wiping the blood from the dying man's face. One of the children, Polia, is sent to bring Sonia, who lives elsewhere since she became a prostitute. A doctor and priest are sent for. When Sonia arrives, her father sees her and cries out for her to forgive him. He dies in her arms. Raskolnikov gives Katherine his last twenty rubles and promises to come back later. On his way out, the girl Polia runs up to thank him. He asks her to remember him in her prayers.
	At this point he tells himself that my life didn't go out with the old woman's and decides not to turn himself in. He goes to Razumikhin's party after all, but elects not to stay. Razumikhin, who is drunk, walks him home and on the way confides that Zosimov believes him to be mad, or nearly so. He also reveals that Zamiotov had told him about their conversation in the tavern and says that he is glad Raskolnikov had taught him a lesson that day, meaning that Raskolnikov had shamed him for suspecting him. When they arrive at the apartment, Raskolnikov's mother and sister are waiting for him, worried about his illness.

Part 3, Chapter 3: Raskolnikov reveals that he gave away the money his mother had sent him, describing the details of Marmeladov's accident and his family's poverty. Raskolnikov's mother mentions that Martha Petrovna, Svidrigailov's wife, has died. There is a rumor that Svidrigailov had beat her and shortly after she had a stroke while bathing. Raskolnikov then reasserts his opposition to Dunia's marrying Luzhin and insists that she must choose between them. He states, Let me be vile. You must not. One's enough. Dunia denies that she is marrying him out of sacrifice, but he does not believe her. They show him the letter from Luzhin and he scoffs at it, and points out that Luzhin is trying to slander him by twisting what actually happened at Marmeladov's. In the end, Dunia informs everyone that she has decided Raskolnikov should accompany them to the meeting after all.
	Part 3, Chapter 4: At that moment, the door opens and Sonia enters, timid, embarrassed and shabbily dressed. Raskolnikov regards her with kindness and pity. He seats her by his sister, despite her low social standing. Sonia is extremely shy and explains that she had come from Katherine Ivanovna to invite him to Marmeladov's funeral and to the dinner afterwards. Katherine had prepared a lavish feast in memory of her husband as well as a testament to the fact that she herself came from better lineage. Pulcheria and Dunia excuse themselves and leave Raskolnikov alone with Sonia. He stares at her for several moments and recalls her father's account of her sacrifice.
	Raskolnikov then tells Razumikhin that he would like him to try and recover Dunia's ring and his father's watch, which he had pawned at the old woman's and which are now in police custody. He explains that he is worried his mother or sister might ask about them. He suggests that it might be better to go straight to Porfiry Petrovich, a relative of Razumikhin's and Razumikhin agrees heartily, saying that Porfiry will be very glad to meet him.
	On her way home, Sonia finds a new universe...taking possession of her soul--feelings are growing for Raskolnikov. It is revealed that Svidrigailov had overheard her say Raskolnikov's name as they parted and has been following her since, only to realize that they are neighbors, at which point he greets her. She feels strangely ashamed and more timid in his presence.
	Razumikhin and Raskolnikov proceed to Porfiry's home. On the way, Razumikhin describes Porfiry as a very smart, skeptical man who likes to fool people. Raskolnikov wonders whether Porfiry knows about his visiting the pawnbroker's apartment and asking about the blood. He decides he will have to find out by the expression on Porfiry's face. He then begins to tease Razumikhin about his obvious infatuation for Dunia and Razumikhin becomes annoyed. Raskolnikov continues to taunt him so that they both enter the flat laughing uproariously.

Part 3, Chapter 5: Raskolnikov enters still laughing and unable to restrain himself for several moments, meaning to affect a tone of spontaneous gaiety and confuse any suspicions Porfiry may have. He is surprised to see that Zamiotov, the officer he had met in the tavern the day before, is there. Raskolnikov then explains that he would like to retrieve the pawned items. Porfiry tells him that he must make a formal statement to the police about the matter. Raskolnikov, who is watching Porfiry closely, begins to suspect that he knows. Porfiry then mentions that he has been waiting for him and that the items were found at the pawnbroker's with his name on them, along with the date they were obtained. He goes on to mention an article of Raskolnikov's which has been published recently. Raskolnikov is surprised to hear that it has been published.
	In the article, Raskolnikov discusses his theory of crime and the extraordinary man. He argues that there are some individuals who are above the law. These extraordinary people are extremely rare, and include men like Napoleon, who step over all obstacles in order to achieve a greater goal. In the end, history agrees with them because their works are not subject to common morality and bring about great changes. These men do not suffer the pangs of conscience others are afflicted with. Their will is supreme. Although it is this theory which has allowed him to murder, Raskolnikov falls short of his definition of the extraordinary man. There rages within him a battle between the cold, calculating killer and the humane being capable of love. Thus at one moment, he is able to murder two people and at another abandon himself utterly to compassion, giving the last of his money to a dead man's family. The extraordinary man is entirely driven by his ideology, while Raskolnikov is aware in some ways of his connectedness to other living beings.
	Porfiry asks Raskolnikov to expound more on his theory and asks whether Raskolnikov considered himself one of the extraordinary men when he wrote the article. Raskolnikov answers that it might very well have been. Porfiry then asks whether it wasn't some future Napoleon who finished off the pawnbroker and her sister. Raskolnikov does not reply. Porfiry then tells him to come by with the statement and at that time they will talk. Raskolnikov, feeling annoyed, answers harshly, Do you want to question me officially, with all the formalities? Porfiry denies this, although Raskolnikov does not believe him. Porfiry then casually asks whether Raskolnikov recalls seeing painters at work in the empty apartment when he had brought his pledges. (Of course, the painters were working the day of the murder, not the day he brought his pledges). Raskolnikov, understanding the trap, says that he doesn't recall seeing them but that someone was moving out. Raskolnikov and Razumikhin leave.
	Part 3, Chapter 6: After leaving Porfiry's, Razumikhin and Raskolnikov discuss the conversation. Razumikhin is insulted by the implication that Porfiry and Zamiotov may suspect Raskolnikov of the crime, and admits that he had noticed the idea hatching quite a while ago. When they reach the lodging where Raskolnikov's mother and sister are staying, Raskolnikov excuses himself, saying he has business to attend to. He goes back to his house and searches the hole in the wall where he had originally stored the stolen items. Nothing is there, however, and he leaves. As he reaches the gate, he hears the janitor say, There he is to a man he has never seen before, who is dressed as an artisan. He goes over to the stranger and asks, What is it? The man stares at him closely for a moment then turns slowly away and leaves through the gate. Raskolnikov follows him and the two walk side by side, not saying anything for a moment until Raskolnikov speaks up and asks him why he had been looking for him. The man calls him a murderer and leaves him standing in the street.
	Raskolnikov goes back to his room and lies on the couch, drained and feeling ill again. After a while he hears Razumikhin check in on him and leave. He is distraught, wondering who the strange man could have been and whether he actually saw anything. At this point, he feels contemptuous of his own weakness and thinks that the extraordinary men are made of bronze, not flesh and blood! He laughs at his pitiful attempt to be extraordinary, thinking Would Napoleon sneak up to an old bag like that along her bed? He decides he is a louse, yet continues to burn with hatred for the old woman. He then ponders gentle creatures like Poor Lizaveta and Sonia, and falls asleep with Sonia in his thoughts.
	He dreams that he goes into the old woman's house and strikes her with the ax again, but she does not die, as if she were made of wood. Every time he strikes, the old woman laughs. When Raskolnikov wakes, Svidrigailov is waiting in his room.

They discuss current political and social topics, while Luzhin counts his money on a table. Sonia is mentioned and Luzhin suddenly brightens and says he would like to meet her.

However, many of the tenants do not show up and the ones who do tend to be of lower social status, a fact which vexes Katherine. When Raskolnikov arrives, Katherine immediately seats him by her side, overjoyed. Throughout the dinner, she makes critical and teasing remarks about the landlady, who overhears. Finally, the two women begin screaming at one another. The fight is cut short when Luzhin enters.

Part 4, Chapter 3: Katherine, who is increasingly emotionally unstable, asks Luzhin to come to her aid, citing her father's hospitality to him. He waves her away contemptuously, openly denying that he knew her father. He goes immediately to Sonia and accuses her of stealing a one hundred-ruble note from his room during their meeting. Katherine rushes to her defense, vehemently denying that Sonia would do such a thing. Sonia is frightened and horrified. She responds that she didn't take anything and gives him back the ten-ruble note he had given her. Sonia looks around her in despair and sees the crowd eyeing her with hostility. Raskolnikov is gazing steadily at her. In anger at Luzhin's accusations, Katherine searches Sonia's pockets. In her right pocket she finds a crumpled one hundred-ruble bill. Katherine still does not believe Sonia is guilty. She gives a pathetic plea to the crowd to come to her aid.
	Suddenly, a voice in the doorway says, How lowdown that is! It is Lebeziatnikov, who testifies that he had seen Luzhin slip the bill into Sonia's pocket and had thought at the time it was because he was doing a good deed. Raskolnikov immediately speaks up and spells out a motive, relaying the details of Luzhin's engagement to Dunia and how he had tried to put Raskolnikov in a bad light by slandering Sonia. Luzhin leaves and on his way out, someone in the crowd throws a glass at him but misses and hits the landlady. At this, she evicts Katherine and her family. Raskolnikov goes to follow Sonia, who had fled.
	Part 4, Chapter 4: Sonia exclaims, What would have happened to me if you hadn't been there! Raskolnikov responds by telling her the incident was based on her social position. He then asks if it were for her to decide, who she would choose to remain alive, Katherine or Luzhin. She rebukes him for asking her something that shouldn't be asked. She keeps asking him what is wrong, sensing something horrible. He understands that she loves him, however, and struggles to reveal the truth. He reminds her that he had promised to tell her who had killed Lizaveta and asks her if she can guess. He turns to face her and says, Take a good look. After understanding, Sonia collapses with grief, but then goes to him and holds both his hands. Why, why did you take this upon yourself! she says and throws her arms around his neck. When he tells her she is strange for embracing him after he what he has told her, she says, ...there is nobody...anywhere in the world now unhappier than you! She says she will go with him to Siberia. He responds saying that maybe he does not want to go to Siberia and in that voice she hears the tones of the murderer.
	Raskolnikov offers various explanations for his crime, but settles on I killed for myself, myself alone. Sonia instructs him to rise and go to the crossroads, to bow down and kiss the earth which he has defiled, then bow down to the four points of the compass and say aloud, I have killed. She says, You must accept suffering and redeem yourself by it. Raskolnikov still resists the idea of repentance and confession.  Since Sonia had turned to him with all her heart he was more miserable. She offers him a cross made of Cypress and says she'll wear one of brass that was given to her by Lizaveta. At that moment, there is a knock at the door. It is Lebeziatnikov.

They threw her out and she was threatening to take the children out onto the streets to perform for money. They rush out of the house, Sonia leading.

Dunia enters. She tells him she has heard about the false suspicions he has endured and that if he ever needs her, she'll come. She turns to leave, but he stops her and tells her that Razumikhin is a good man and capable of loving deeply. When she leaves, he reflects that if he had embraced her, afterwards she might remember it and shudder.

She is completely mad and alternates between instructing the children on song and dance and beating them. When they find her, Sonia is begging her to come home and weeping. Katherine refuses to leave, saying, Let all Petersburg see how the children of a decent father beg for alms. Finally, two of the small children break away and run and Katherine follows. She stumbles and falls, and blood comes spurting from her lungs. A policeman helps carry her to Sonia's place, where she dies, half-delirious, crying, They've finished off the old nag! She's...overstrained! In the midst of the chaos, Svidrigailov had turned up. He approaches Raskolnikov and tells him he will pay for the funeral and put the children in the best orphanage he can find. He further plans to set aside a thousand and a half rubles for each child for when they come of age and will pull [Sonia] out of the mud too...You can tell your sister that's how I used her ten thousand. When Raskolnikov asks why he is doing this, Svidrigailov responds by repeating some bits of the conversation he had had with Sonia, thus revealing that he been behind the partition the whole time and had heard everything.
	Part 6, Chapter 1: A strange time began for Raskolnikov, during which he brooded and grew anxious. In later recollection, it seemed like his consciousness kept flashing on and off. He worries especially over Svidrigailov, whom he does not trust. He does not attend Katherine's funeral.
	Razumikhin comes to see him and tells him that Dunia had received a letter today that upset her very much. He also says that they caught the murderer, referring to the painter. When Razumikhin leaves, he is thinking about how his previous notion about Raskolnikov had been nasty and vulgar and that Nikolay's confession would bring everything to light.  Thus, Razumikhin had consciously entertained suspicions that Raskolnikov was the murderer.
	Raskolnikov now wonders whether Razumikhin suspects him. He decides to go out but bumps into Porfiry when he opens the door.

Part 6, Chapter 2: Raskolnikov tenses up, recalling their last encounter. Porfiry announces that he has come to offer Raskolnikov an explanation. He explains that he knows that the artisan came to see him after their meeting and that he had been firmly convinced that Raskolnikov had committed the crime, although he had not until recently had any solid facts. Instead, he relied on what he knew of Raskolnikov's character. At first, Raskolnikov wonders whether Porfiry believes he is innocent. Porfiry reveals that the painter Nikolay belongs to a religious faction that embraces suffering, which explains his confession. He then gives a perfect account of the killer's bookish dreams...and a heart troubled by theories. Here we have a determination to make a first step. He then recounts how the killer had forgotten to close the door behind him, yet had killed two people and that he had not been up for stealing money and stashed what he did take beneath a stone. He describes, in graphic detail, the way the killer had hidden behind the door, crouching, while the doorbell was ringing. How the experience hadn't been enough for him and he had returned to the site later to ring the doorbell and experience that chill running down his spine. When Raskolnikov feebly asks who the killer is, Porfiry responds calmly, Why, Rodion Romanych, YOU killed.
	He explains that he does not Raskolnikov to see him as a monster and that he is sincerely well disposed to him. He then proposes openly that Raskolnikov give up and confess. He mentions that he has one little clue, sent by the Lord, which he will not reveal to Raskolnikov. He says that he will not arrest him for several days, to give Raskolnikov the chance to make a confession on his own. He then tells him that suffering is a good thing. In addition, he is certain that Raskolnikov will not run away. Raskolnikov waits for Porfiry to reach the street and then he leaves.

My Antonia: Novel Summary,"Introduction
My Ántonia opens with a short frame story: the author (presumably Willa Cather) relates a chance meeting with an old acquaintance, Jim Burden, on a train ride through Iowa.  The time appears to be roughly contemporary with the publication of the novel (1918).  The two adults reminisce about their shared Nebraska childhood, where they first met, and they mention a woman named Ántonia.  They challenge each other to write an account of their relationship with Ántonia, and only Jim appears to follow through, composing a lengthy manuscript and bringing it to her a few months later.  The author says that this manuscript became the text of My Ántonia. 
Analysis
	Cather chooses this character of Jim Burden as the narrator for two obvious reasons. It allows her to manipulate or mediate the perspective that she uses to write about Ántonia (as a romantic interest, as an exceptionally strange woman, among many other perspectives), and it displaces some of the credit/blame for the story to someone else without moving too far away from her (someone from her hometown in Nebraska, who understands life in a small prairie town).
	 
	A frame story is a narrative within which a character proceeds to tell a story.  
Book I: The Shimerdas
Parts I – IV
Part I
	The book opens with Jim Burden, the narrator, being taken west from Virginia to Nebraska to live with his grandparents after his parents’ deaths.  Jake Marpole, a farm hand who worked for Jim’s parents, accompanies him.  Jake is a young man at the time, and Jim is ten years old.  They take a train across the country, and they hear about an immigrant family traveling on the same train going to the same place, Black Hawk, Nebraska.  Jake buys and gives Jim a copy of The Life of Jesse James, a book he treasures for many years. 
	When they arrive at Black Hawk, Jake and Jim see the immigrant family (the Shimerdas), and hear the family talking in a foreign language.  They are greeted by Otto Fuchs, a German immigrant and employee of Jim’s grandparents.  Jim compares Fuchs to a character from the Jesse James book—he is visibly tanned and scarred, and dressed like a cowboy—and Fuchs leads them to a wagon to take them to the Burdens’ farm.  Jim notices the immigrant family again, getting into the only other wagon present. Fuchs drives them over the Nebraska land, and Jim thinks to himself about how empty and featureless the land is compared to Virginia.  He realizes he has left his parents behind, and he feels intimidated and insignificant under the vast sky and wide, flat land.
	Part II
	Jim falls asleep in the wagon and wakes up in his grandparents’ house.  He sees his grandmother when he opens his eyes, and she immediately compares him to her dead son—Jim’s father—and invites him into the kitchen.  Jim makes his way out of bed and down to the basement kitchen, and he seems impressed by the order and cleanliness of the arrangement.  He takes a bath in the tin washtub in the kitchen while his grandmother is in the attached dining room, refusing her help with cleaning himself.  Jim notices the details of the kitchen, acquaints himself with the pets of the house, and muses for a little while on his impressions of his grandparents.  Otto Fuchs introduces him to one of the horses, and Jim, Otto, and Jake are called upstairs for prayers.  The next day, Jim goes outside and starts to get to know the town.  His grandparents apparently live in the only wooden house in the entire town; the neighbors live in sod houses.  Most of the area around the house, at least the part not covered with corn, is covered with wild red grass. 
	As Jim is musing on the red grass, his grandmother invites him to accompany her to the garden to dig up some potatoes.  She tells him that he should never go to the garden without some kind of weapon to protect him from rattlesnakes.  After digging some potatoes, Jim asks if he can stay in the garden without his grandmother.  She agrees, but she gives him some information about all of the various animals that he might see.  He spends a good portion of the day in the garden, and he enjoys the feeling that he has become part of the land. 
	Part III
	A few days later, Jim accompanies Otto Fuchs on a trip to visit the new Bohemian family in the town with a gift of some provisions.  Jim finds out that the Bohemian family, the Shimerdas, bought a piece of land not far from his grandparents, and that they had paid too much for it.  They had been swindled by Peter Krajiek, a Bohemian man who was already living there.  No one in the family spoke enough English to survive without Krajiek, so he also functioned as their interpreter.  Fuchs suggests that he might have helped them with Krajiek, except that he doesn’t think the Shimerdas will trust an Austrian.  When asked to explain, Fuchs says that it’s “politics,” and that it would take too long, but that Bohemians don’t trust Austrians. 
	As the Grandmother, Fuchs, and Jim make their way to the Shimerdas’ farm, they notice Squaw Creek, a narrow stream that runs through a deep ravine through the Shimerdas’ land.  The ravine makes farming that piece of land difficult and reduces its value.  They come upon the Shimerdas’ house, a dugout built against the edge of the ravine.  Mrs. Shimerda comes out of the house to meet them, and shakes Grandmother’s hand.  She speaks a little English about the house, saying that it is no good.  Ántonia and Yulka, the two daughters, come out of the house and meet the visitors, as does Ambrosch, the oldest son.  Ántonia, Jim notices, is brown-skinned and brown-eyed, and quite beautiful.  She is about fourteen years old, a few years older than Jim.  While the two families are talking, Krajiek and Marek, the second son who shows off a webbed finger and acts a bit strangely, approach from the barn.  At some point, Mr. Shimerda emerges, and Jim is greatly impressed by his appearance and his demeanor.  Mr. Shimerda doesn’t seem to belong on a farm; he seems too aristocratic for farm labor. 
	Ántonia and Yulka drag Jim away from his family and bring him over to the edge of the ravine.  Ántonia starts quizzing him on the English names for things, including his own.  Jim teaches her several English words, and she tries to repay him with a gift of a ring.  After a little while, Mr. Shimerda comes looking for the girls, and they run to meet him.  Mr. Shimerda confronts Jim with a silent, questioning look.  Then he returns to the house, takes out a book with Bohemian and English alphabets, and asks Grandmother to teach Ántonia English. 
	Part IV
	Jim learns to ride one of his grandparents’ horses, and he becomes the messenger for the family.  As the messenger, with the freedom of travel that he has with the horse, he becomes a sightseer, traveling about the area to admire the landscapes.  He also instructs Ántonia in English every day.  She runs across the prairie between them, and Jim shares some of the watermelon from the farm with her.  Jim also notices the ways that the rattlesnakes take advantage of the prairie dogs in the area, and compares Krajiek to a rattlesnake in a prairie dog town.  The Shimerdas don’t know how to get rid of their only English-speaking Bohemian companion. 
Analysis, Parts I-IV
	Cather sets the Shimerda family up in a way that seems to promise catastrophe.  In her description of Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch, she suggests that they are self-interested and cunning.  Mr. Shimerda appears to be set up to be a victim of tragedy, as a kind of great man set up to suffer through inappropriate or unsuitable challenges.  He is a musician but there is no one who will listen to him.  The family also appears to be facing a difficult struggle, with a poor house and a poor plot of land to farm, and only a cheating Krajiek to help them succeed as farmers.  Jim’s family appears as welcome charity to the Shimerdas, but Jim’s family has no solution for the bulk of the Shimerdas’ problems.

Adam Bede: Summary,"George Eliot, Adam Bede. Edited with an Introduction by Stephen Gill. Penguin Books, London, 1980, rpt. 1985.
Book First
 
Summary of Chapter 1: The Workshop
The narrator will magically use the ink of her pen as a mirror to show us the carpentry workshop of Jonathan Burge in the village of Hayslope in Loamshire, England, 1799. Five workmen there are busy, the most striking of them a tall strong man singing a hymn in a baritone voice as he finishes a mantelpiece. This is Adam Bede, the obvious leader of the group. His brother, Seth, is younger and claims he has finished the door he is working on. Sandy Jim teases him that he forgot the panels on the door. Wiry Ben Cranage pipes in saying that after all, Seth is a wool-gathering Methodist. Adam pushes Ben against the wall until he promises to leave his brother alone. In friendly laughter, the men accuse Seth of thinking of the woman Methodist preacher who will preach on the Green tonight. Seth is in love with Dinah Morris and invites the others to hear her. Adam declares his loyalty to the Church but believes everyone should worship as he chooses. When the church clock strikes six, the other men immediately leave off working, but Adam chides them for having no pride in their work, and he continues until he finishes, going home with his dog, Gyp, while Seth goes to the Green to hear Dinah preach. A stranger, passing by on horseback, cannot help but admire Adam Bede as he passes.
Commentary on Chapter 1
The chapter introduces the place and plunges us into a rural community in Loamshire, perhaps a fictitious name for Warwickshire where the author, Mary Ann Evans grew up and knew farm and village folk. Her father managed an estate there, and his early life provided material for the character of Adam Bede. This is country life in old England before the industrial revolution changed everything, and people moved to the cities for jobs. The author investigates the rural people, their habits and thinking, in greater detail than the English novel had done, for it usually dealt with the upper and middle classes. In this, Eliot is indebted to the poet, William Wordsworth, whose poetry is mentioned in the text. A quote from Wordsworth’s “The Excursion” also appears on the title page. The trials of simple country folk were significant to Wordsworth in what they could teach about life, since they were closer to the earth and primal feelings.
Adam Bede’s name indicates a primal man, like Adam in the Garden of Eden before the fall. Bede is the name of the Anglo-Saxon saint and historian of seventh and eighteenth century England and again brings up the suggestion of early English life in its simplicity. Adam is a peasant attached to the earth and is contrasted to the more spoiled gentry, like Arthur Donnithorne. Eliot uses dialect for the lower class characters, who speak for themselves, and then the narrator comments on their ways and their history, like a latter day Bede.
Adam’s protectiveness towards his younger brother Seth, his fondness for his dog, his love of his work, his love of learning, and his integrity all surface in the very first chapter. The other men respect him, even when he is a little stern with them. The discussion of religion is a main theme in the book and begins here with introducing the “dissenters” or groups that disagreed with the established English church, like the Methodists. Methodism began as a reform movement within the Church of England, begun by John and Charles Wesley, in 1729. Soon, it separated and became a religious movement of its own. The Methodists ministered to the poor, especially in the growing populations around industrial mill towns. These poor were more desperate than the poor in farm country. Methodists made converts easily near the mills and gave people hope, support, and unity. Seth is a Methodist, but Adam does not see why people should not stick to the Church. However, he has been influenced by his own pastor, Mr. Irwine, a tolerant man believing one should worship according to conscience. Adam also defends practical knowledge as important to learn as religion, and that is why he goes to night school to better himself.
The theme of the book is found in the hymn Adam keeps singing: “Let all thy converse be sincere,/ Thy conscience as the noonday clear.”  Adam is known for his honest dealings with others, a standard that not everyone can maintain, he finds out. Because he is so strong, both physically and morally, he cannot understand the weakness of others.",Adam Bede,Adam Bede: Summary,"25    Adam BedebyGeorge Eliot  [pseudonym of Mary An...

	The author expresses both pleasure and sorrow at finishing his novel ?pleasure at having successfully completed this lengthy project, and sorrow at parting from the work, which has become a part of him.
	Chapter I: I am born
	The adult David Copperfield narrates the story of his life, beginning with his birth.
	The women of David's neighborhood believe, based on the time of his birth, that he is destined to be unlucky and that he would possess the gift of seeing ghosts and spirits. On the first prediction, he comments that the story he will tell will reveal its truth or otherwise, and on the second prediction, he comments that he is not aware of having any such gift.
	David's father is already dead when he is born. An aunt of his father's, Miss Betsey Trotwood, turns up on the day of his birth. Betsey was once married to a man who beat her and tried to kill her, and she ended up paying him to stay away from her. Though Betsey was fond of David's father, she was contemptuous of his mother, Clara Copperfield, calling her ""a wax doll.?/p>
	This is the first time that Betsey has met Clara, and she gives her the nickname of Baby because of her youthful appearance. Betsey informs Clara that she is certain that she will give birth to a girl. She intends to be a friend to the girl, and to ensure that she does not place her trust in the type of man who will take advantage of her, as she herself did.
	Later, Mr. Chillip, the doctor, emerges from the birthing room with the news that Clara has had a boy. Without a word, Betsey walks out of the house, never to return.
	Chapter II: I observe
	David describes some of his earliest memories. He remembers his pretty mother, and the kindly nurse, Clara Peggotty, who runs the household. One evening, David is reading to Peggotty from a book about crocodiles. He asks Peggotty if a person whose spouse dies can marry again. Peggotty says that they can if they choose, though she sounds unenthusiastic.
	Clara comes in with Mr. Murdstone, a handsome man with black hair, eyes and whiskers, who is courting her. David takes an instant dislike to him. David falls asleep. When he wakes, he hears that both women are in tears. Peggotty is telling Clara that her former husband, David's father, would not have liked Mr. Murdstone.
	Mr. Murdstone returns one day and takes David on a trip to Lowestoft, a nearby town, to meet some of his business acquaintances. One of the men, Mr. Quinion, jokes with Mr. Murdstone about his courtship of Clara and David's dislike of him. David observes that the men seem to share his wariness of Mr. Murdstone, and that Mr. Murdstone never laughs with them.
	One evening, Peggotty asks David to accompany her on a two-week visit to her brother's at Yarmouth. He excitedly agrees. As he says goodbye to his mother, Mr. Murdstone appears at her side and tells her to control her emotions.
	Chapter III: I have a change
	Peggotty and David travel by carrier's cart to Yarmouth, where they are met at an inn by Peggotty's nephew, Ham. Ham takes them to his family's home, which is a boat converted into a house. Inside there is a smell of fish. Peggotty's brother, Daniel Peggotty, who owns the house, deals in seafood, which he stores in an outhouse. Mr. Peggotty lives in the house with his nephew, Ham, and his niece, Little Em'ly, whom he adopted when their fathers drowned at sea. Also living with Mr. Peggotty is Mrs. Gummidge, the widow of Mr. Peggotty's partner in a boat. Mr. Peggotty is an easy-going man who only becomes angry if his generosity in adopting destitute people is mentioned.
	Next morning, David goes out onto the beach with Little Em'ly, where they collect pebbles and fall in love with each other. Little Em'ly says that she is afraid of the sea, which has destroyed so many local men and boats. She also reveals that she wants to be a lady. The adult David reflects that perhaps it would have been better if the sea had swallowed Little Em'ly that morning, so that she would not have to suffer everything that she suffered since.
	Mrs. Gummidge turns out to be a depressed sort of woman, given to complaining that ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me.?She claims that while others may share the adverse conditions that cause her grief, ""I feel it more."" Mr. Peggotty remarks that ""She's been thinking of the old 'un,"" meaning her dead husband.
	At the end of their vacation, Peggotty and David set out for home. David is excited to see his mother again, but Peggotty tries to restrain his enthusiasm. When they reach home, David is baffled that his mother has not come out to the gate to meet him. He fears that she is dead. Peggotty reveals that Clara has married Mr. Murdstone.
	David finds his mother sitting with Mr. Murdstone by the fire. Clara rises to meet David, but Mr. Murdstone tells her again to control her emotions. David finds that his bedroom has been moved to a more distant room. There is a fierce black dog in the kennel in the yard, which springs out to attack him.
	Analysis of Chapters I-III
	The narrator, David Copperfield, looks back on his childhood and tells his story. Though he very occasionally interjects a comment from the perspective of the older and wiser adult, for the most part, he describes events as they appeared to him as a child without adult reflection. This has the effect of reinforcing the naivete and innocence of David as a character. For example, when David accompanies Mr. Murdstone to Lowestoft, Mr. Quinion jokes with the others about David's dislike of Mr. Murdstone. David, being a very young child, has no idea that ""Brooks of Sheffield"" is an invented name to hide the fact that the men are talking about him. In fact, David joins in their laughter at his own expense. It would have been easy for Dickens to add an adult comment to explain that Brooks of Sheffield is really David, but the fact that he does not enables the reader to reach this conclusion independently. The reader is thereby cast in the role of the knowing adult observer, and David retains his childish helplessness and innocence, engaging the reader's sympathy and pity. This authorial technique, in which the reader knows more of the truth than the protagonist does about the other characters' true motives, is called dramatic irony.
	Occasionally, Dickens breaks his practice of giving purely the child's view of David's life, as when the adult David comments that he sometimes feels it would have been better if Little Em'ly had drowned on the day they met, rather than suffer as she has done since. This is an example of foreshadowing, a technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel to create an ominous feeling. The reader is given a sense of Em'ly's future difficulties, setting up an expectation that makes him want to read on and find out what happens to the character.
	Betsey Trotwood's question to Clara Copperfield about whether she and her husband, David's father, were happily married, introduces one of the major themes of the novel: the importance of equality within marriage. Clara's response prompts Betsey to comment disapprovingly that Clara and her first husband were ""not equally matched."" This is a situation with which Betsey is all too familiar, as she herself has been dominated by a cruel husband. The scene with Betsey and Clara is also an example of foreshadowing. Here, Betsey's history warns the reader of the looming disaster of Clara's second marriage, in which she will also be dominated by a cruel husband (Mr. Murdstone). This warning is reinforced by David and Peggotty's instinctive dislike of Mr. Murdstone and by Peggotty's warning that Clara's first husband would not like Mr. Murdstone. The fact that David is removed to Yarmouth in order to allow the marriage to go ahead smoothly is also a foreshadowing of how David's family life will change: he will be excluded from the compact between his mother and her new husband.
	Another foreshadowing technique that Dickens frequently uses in this novel is his use of a character's appearance to describe their soul. David's good-hearted and innocent mother is beautiful and childlike in appearance; Mr. Murdstone is as dark of soul as he is of hair; and Peggotty is as warm and honest as her ruddy face and work-roughened hands.
	As well as being defined by their appearance, many characters in the novel are defined by a catchphrase - just as, in a cartoon, a character is defined by one or two distinguishing characteristics, like a big nose or prominent ears. Mrs. Gummidge can be summed up by her catchphrase, ""I am a lone lorn creetur...and everythink goes contrairy with me."" She remains loyal to her catchphrase until late in the novel, where she surprises everyone by turning into its opposite - but the catchphrase still rules supreme, even as she defies it.
	The characters do not change in their essence throughout the novel; their motivations are established at their first introduction, and remain constant. Little Em'ly retains her desire to be a lady, and it proves her undoing. Clara retains her babyish innocence, and Mr. Murdstone his desire to control her. Betsey's chief motivation is to ensure that no other girl should suffer at the hands of unscrupulous men, as she has. She is bitterly disappointed that Clara does not provide her with a girl child to fulfill her ambition, but in time, she will transfer her protective instinct to David.",David Copperfield,David Copperfield: Summary: Chapters I-III,"44    David CopperfieldbyCharles Dickens\n\n\n\n\n\r...

Ivanhoe: Summary,"Chapter I
	The story is set in England in the twelfth century, towards the end of the reign of Richard I. Richard is absent from the country. He has been imprisoned in Austria on his return from the Crusades in the Holy Land. In his absence, the nobles have established a tyranny, and the lower classes suffer under it. This situation arose as a result of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Although four generations have passed since then, there is still hostility between the Normans, who were originally from France, and the conquered population of Anglo-Saxons.
	It is an early evening in summer in a forest in the area of northern England known as the West Riding of Yorkshire. Gurth, the swine-herd, is talking to Wamba, the jester. Both are in the employ of Cedric of Rotherwood, a Saxon noble. Gurth appeals to Wamba to help him round up the herd, but Wamba is reluctant. Wamba then makes a series of pointed jokes at the expense of the Normans, whom they both dislike. Gurth then complains that the Normans take the best of everything, although Cedric has been valiant in the preservation of Saxon rights. But he fears the imminent visit of a Norman noble, Reginald Front-de-Boeuf.
	Chapter II
	A group of ten horsemen overtake Wamba and Gurth on the road. The two most important men in this group are an easy-going, generous-minded monk, Prior Aymer of Jorvaulx, and a stern knight of the order of the Knights Templar, Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who has been fighting in the Holy Land. The other men are their attendants. The prior and the knight ask Gurth and Wamba the way to Cedric the Saxon’s home, where they desire to stay the night. Gurth is reluctant to give these Normans directions to his master’s dwelling, and he quarrels with the knight. The prior intervenes to keep the peace. Then Wamba gives the men the wrong directions. But when the men reach the place called Sunken Cross, where Wamba told them to turn left, they cannot remember what the directions were. They stop a stranger, who says he is also going to Cedric’s. The stranger, who says he is a palmer (pilgrim) just returned from the Holy Land, then leads them in the right direction until they arrive at Cedric’s mansion.
	Chapter III
	In Cedric’s mansion, the hall is prepared for the evening meal. Cedric sits at his table on a raised dais, waiting for the dinner, which has been delayed, to be served. Several servants stand behind him, and his dogs are at his feet. Cedric is anxious because Gurth has not returned with the herd, and he fears that some misfortune has befallen them, although he is more worried about the herd (which is valuable) than about Gurth. He is also impatient for his favorite clown, Wamba. When Oswald, his cup-bearer, says that Gurth is not that late, since the curfew bell only tolled an hour ago, Cedric is put in an even worse temper. This is because the curfew is a Norman imposition. Cedric rants about all the injustices that accompany Norman rule, and he also mentions his son that he banished. Then the sound of the Knight Templar’s horn outside interrupts him. Cedric is none too pleased to hear who the visitors are, because both are Normans, but he wishes to show hospitality nonetheless. The guests are shown in.
	Chapter IV
	Cedric greets his hosts with dignity, although there is some tension between the Saxon Cedric and his Norman guests. Wamba and Gurth return, to Cedric’s complaints about how tardy they are. The feast is a fine one, and the diners are joined by Cedric’s beautiful young ward, the Lady Rowena. Brian de Bois-Guilbert, the Knight Templar, is captivated by her and stares at her, which displeases both Rowena and Cedric. In the discussion over dinner, it transpires that the Knight and Prior are on their way to a tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouche. Another stranger arrives at the gate, and Cedric authorizes his page to allow him to stay the night.
The opening chapters introduce a number of the themes of the novel and show the situations of many of the main characters. Chapter I makes is clear how divided the country is between Normans and Saxons, and how the Norman nobles have established a tyranny. In this theme the author, Sir Walter Scott, is not being true to history. Scholars of the period agree that any hostility between Norman and Saxon did not last for four generations after the Norman Conquest. In those days, people were more conscious of divisions of rank than of national origin. Scott’s picture of Saxons and Normans in fact represents more the typical nineteenth century view of the good-hearted, rough-and-ready English and the foppish, pretentious French. Hostility between England and France was a habit acquired over several centuries of frequent wars between the two countries. (The war in which the English defeated Napoleon was fresh in the minds of the first readers of Ivanhoe, which was published only a few years after Napoleon’s final defeat.)
	The lines of conflict that are to dominate the novel are clearly drawn in the opening chapters. Cedric’s disinheritance of his son is mentioned, and this father-son drama will become an important element in the plot. Lady Rowena is introduced, and as a beautiful young unmarried woman she is clearly going to be the subject of a romantic plot, although De Bois-Guilbert’s early interest in her does prove to be something of a red herring.
	The Norman villain of the novel is also introduced in these early chapters. De Bois-Guilbert is presented as an arrogant, quarrelsome knight, as his treatment of Gurth in Chapter II shows. His susceptibility to women, later to become one of the main plot elements, is also shown. It runs counter to the vow of chastity he took as a member of the Knight Templar Order.
	Just as the representatives of medieval chivalry do not emerge as admirable characters, neither do the representatives of the medieval church. One such representative is introduced in these chapters. The initial description of the Prior tells its own tale. His clothes are much finer than the rules of his Cistercian order permit—a sign of his hypocrisy. The fact that he is overweight, not to mention the twinkle in his eye, indicates that he enjoys the pleasures of eating and drinking.

The Jungle: Novel Summary,"

Summary
The Jungle begins with Marija Berczynskas overseeing and organizing a wedding ceremony in the ‘back of the yards’ in Chicago. She is Lithuanian and today her cousin, Ona Lukoszaite, has just married fellow Lithuanian Jurgis Rudkus. Ona is not quite sixteen and the readers are told her new husband is able to carry a two hundred and fifty pound quarter of beef without staggering, but he is as ‘frightened as a hunted animal’ at the wedding celebrations.
	A ‘charming informality’ is one of the characteristics of this celebration, but it is a law (transplanted from Lithuania) that no one leaves hungry. Ona’s stepmother is Aunt Elizabeth, and is referred to as Teta Elzbieta, and she and other women bring masses of food through to the guests.
	There is also music being played and this transforms the place from a saloon ‘to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky’. The violinist is Tamoszius Kuszleika and he later gets engaged to Marija. Ona is spared from crying too much (with happiness) by listening to Marija teach the musicians a song they do not know. She is described as a powerful woman who works in a canning factory handling fourteen-pound cans of beef.
	Following this, Antanas (Jurgis’s father) gives a speech. He is sixty years old, but looks eighty. He and the rest of the family have only been in the United States for six months, but this is already affecting him adversely. He works in the pickle rooms at Durham’s and this is damaging his chest.
	The music begins again and the guests dance along. The older ones wear some item of clothing that is from their homeland, but the younger people avoid doing this. These younger people have assimilated more than their elders. Some of the dancers are described, such as Alena Jasaityte. She is the ‘beauty of the evening’ and paints cans all week in a factory.
	The next event is one of the most important of the evening. This is the acziavimas, which is a three or four hour uninterrupted dance and each guest dances and leaves money for the bride and groom. The wedding costs two even three hundred dollars and this is more than a man’s wages for a year. The vesilija is a form of compact where the guests eat and drink as much as they desire, but also give the married couple money. This tradition is changing in the ‘new country’, though, and some are leaving without donating anything. Jurgis says not to worry as he will work harder to pay the bills for the wedding.
	Chapter Two begins by explaining how Jurgis is still young and optimistic, and talks lightly about work. He is also naïve and has never lived in a city before. He met Ona and her family in Lithuania and her father initially refused him permission to marry her. Jurgis went back to see her a year later to ask again only to find her father had died and the family were now impoverished. This family now consisted of Ona, Teta Elzbieta, her six children and Ona’s brother Jonas. They all believed that coming to the United States would give them freedom and more opportunities. Before they set off, and at the last moment, Marija also decides to join them.
	When they arrive in the Packingtown district in Chicago, the smell of the stockyards greets them first. They are almost penniless once they reach here after being taken advantage of in New York (as they are clearly immigrants and know no English). They all stay at Aniele Jukniene’s home as she takes in lodgers. This is already overcrowded and ‘unthinkably filthy’. There are lots of children in the area, but no school and there is a fetid odor because this part of town is built on the city dump. Despite these conditions, Ona and Jurgis look out at Packingtown in awe.
	In Chapter Three, Jokubas, a fellow Lithuanian who runs a delicatessen, shows them around the area. The cattle pens alone take up half of a square mile. He takes them to Durham’s and shows them a room where hogs are killed and the sound of their pitiful shrieks is given in detail. Their deaths are also depicted; a chain is attached to one of their legs and they are swung on this chain before being killed. The factory is described as such: ‘It was porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics.’ The narrative continues to describe the unpleasant conditions and how the inspectors are lax in checking the hogs for tuberculosis.
	Descriptions then ensue of the killing of cattle and of how nothing of the animals is wasted at Durham’s. They are thought to furnish food for thirty million people. At this early time in the narrative, Jurgis thinks the workers should be grateful to have positions with such a company and is described as guileless.
	His first work is with Durham’s rivals, Brown’s. The bosses quickly choose him when he first waits for work, because he is young and has a large stature. Because of his naivety, he is unable to see that he is lucky to have been picked.
Analysis
	Chapter One begins with the marriage of Ona and Jurgis and from Chapter Two to Chapter Seven the narrative takes the readers back to explain how the families arrived and settled in the United States, and how they saved for the wedding to take place.
	Chapter One is primarily concerned with describing how Ona and Jurgis are marrying in a traditionally Lithuanian way, and how these customs are being eroded for the worse in this new country. In the United States, the guests are less willing to pay after eating and drinking as much as possible. By beginning in such a way, the novel emphasizes immediately how the United States is having a detrimental effect on earlier traditions and how the cracks in the family’s American Dream are beginning to appear after being in this country for only a few months.
	Chapters Two and Three trace back to six months ago to when Jurgis and his father and Ona and her family came to the United States with hopes for a better future. The narrative is careful to reiterate how they innocently presumed that life would improve. This is most evident in the depiction of the central character, Jurgis, who at this early time still believes that he will be treated fairly. He is depicted as honest and willing to work, and it is also evident that he is naïve in the practices of the packers (the firms who kill the animals and produce the meat and by-products). He is in awe of companies such as Durham’s and Brown’s and is unable to see that he has only been chosen to work because of his age and build and neither of these advantages will last long with the hard work he has to undertake.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary,"The story begins at the camp of the Union army during the Civil War. The men have been at camp for a long time. A tall soldier tells his comrades he is convinced they are about to move on the enemy, which is camped the other side of the river. Some men disagree, and there is a spirited debate. A young private listens to the debate, and then retreats to his hut to be alone. He is full of anticipation that he is about to participate in his first battle. He is a romantic, idealist young man, raised on a farm, who has dreamed of battles all his life. He had wanted to enlist in the Union army, but his mother discouraged him. Eventually he enlisted, against his mother’s wishes. Reluctantly, she lets him go. His friends all admire him for enlisting. On the way to Washington with his regiment, he is treated like a hero. Following that, he had to put up with months of monotony in a camp, an endless round of drills and reviews. He sees almost nothing of the enemy, and doubts whether he will ever be a part of a real battle. He listens to the stories of veterans, but he does not know how much to believe. He suddenly thinks that perhaps in a battle, he might run away. This question worries him.
	The tall soldier and the loud private he is arguing with join the youth in the hut. The youth, whose name is Henry Fleming, asks the tall soldier directly whether there is going to be a battle, and the soldier assures him there will be. Henry asks the soldier’s opinion about how the regiment will perform, since it is composed mostly of men who have never been in a battle. The soldier says that some may run away, but in general they will fight well. Henry asks the tall soldier, whose name is Jim Conklin, whether he had ever thought he might run himself. Jim replies that if a lot of men started to run, he probably would as well. But if everyone stood and fought, he would too. Henry is reassured by Jim’s statement.
Analysis
	The first chapter sets the scene and introduces the main characters. By not giving any specific details of place or time, or even stating directly which army Henry is a member of, the author gives the scene a general rather than specific significance. He intends to explore the psychological aspects of war as it is experienced by the ordinary soldier, so the generality of the descriptions carry significance beyond their time and place. (The novel is in fact loosely based on the Civil War battle of Chancellorville in May, 1863, although nowhere is this stated.) The author’s desire to create a universal effect is also seen in the way the characters in this chapter are described. For the most part, they are the “tall soldier,” the “loud private,” and “the youth,” rather than being given specific names.
	This chapter also shows that Henry has reached a crucial point in his life. As a young boy, he had thought of war as a romantic, glorious enterprise, although he also believed that it was something that belonged to the pages of history, not something that could happen in the present. When the Civil War breaks out, at first he does not take it seriously, and thinks that no war could match the heroics he has read about in ancient Greek books. Men had been civilized and had lost the savage spirit that used to animate them. But now war has come, and he has enlisted, he will begin to discover a lot about himself that he had previously not even thought about. The key issue is how he will behave in battle. He is disturbed by thoughts that he may run away. The thoughts he has on that subject suggest that the novel will be about the mind of a young soldier as he faces combat for the first time. It is the psychological aspects of war that will be the focus, not so much the physical events, although they will be vividly described also.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 2-4,"The tall soldier’s information proves to be incorrect. The army does not move. But Henry is still troubled by the question of whether he will run away when battle begins, and he gets frustrated because he knows there is no way he can answer this question until the time comes. He wonders what the rest of the men are thinking, but he dare not ask. Sometimes he thinks they are all heroes; at other times he convinces himself they are all fearful of the prospect of battle. In his anxiety he frequently reproaches himself for his thoughts, and sometimes fixes his anger upon the generals, whom he regards as intolerably slow.
	One morning, just before dawn, Henry is convinced that a battle is imminent. The regiment begins to march. There is a vigorous discussion among the men as to what will happen. They seem in good spirits, but Henry is weighed down by his own thoughts. At nightfall they stop in a field and set up camp. Henry keeps to himself as much as possible. He lies down in the grass and wishes he were back home on the farm. The loud private, whose name is Wilson, joins him. Wilson believes there will soon be a big battle, and that they will be victorious. Henry asks him how he knows he will not run when the time comes. Wilson says of course he will not run. His confident reply makes Henry feel miserable, since it is clear that their viewpoints have nothing in common. He torments himself with his fears about how he will react to battle, and eventually falls asleep.
	The following night, the military columns file across the river on two pontoon bridges. The next morning they march along a road that leads them deep into a forest. Then at dawn one morning, the men start to run down a road together. There is the sound of distant firing. Henry realizes the time for battle has come. It is impossible for him to escape. His mind plays tricks with him, and he convinces himself that he never wanted to go to war; the government had forced him into it. They cross a stream and climb a hill. A skirmish is already underway; he sees the body of a dead soldier, and expects the enemy to fall upon them at any moment. He thinks the generals are all idiots, and considers shouting a warning to all the men. Harried by a young lieutenant, Henry quickens his pace. The regiment marches from place to place apparently aimlessly. Henry is impatient, and complains to Jim Conklin and Wilson.
	In the afternoon the regiment, having just gone over the same ground it covered earlier, enters a new region. Henry thinks it would be better to get killed instantly; that at least would end his worries. When they get close to the battle, Jim confesses to Henry that he expects to be killed. He gives Henry a packet of his belongings and tells him to convey it to his, Jim’s, family.
	The men of the regiment exchange rumors of what is happening in the battle. The noise increases and the bullets begin to fly close to them. The lieutenant is shot in the hand. As the battle intensifies, the men of the new regiment are breathless with horror. Many men are fleeing from the battle, although Henry has not yet seen what they are fleeing from. He resolves to get a good view of it, thinking all the time that once he has done this, he will probably run faster than any of them.
Analysis
	Although surrounded by his comrades, Henry is very much alone with his thoughts, knowing that the question he has asked of himself will soon be answered. His verbal abuse of the generals, which other characters also express, show that this is a novel written from the point of view of the ordinary soldier who knows nothing of what his generals are planning. The commanders in this war are seen only from afar.
	Although this is a realistic novel, many passages are tinged with irony. For example, there is a quiet irony in the description of how the soldiers of the new regiment, as they march, start to look like more experienced soldiers. But there is one thing about them that is different from veteran regiments: “Veteran regiments in the army were likely to be very small aggregations of men” (ch. 3, p. 32). What this means is that large numbers of the soldiers in the regiment have been killed. The understated way of expressing this fact is probably more horrifying than a simple statement of the number of casualties would have been. And the passage that follows, in which other soldiers mistake the decimated regiment for a brigade (which is much smaller than a regiment) underlines the irony. It is also significant that rather than react with horror, the other soldiers laugh when they realize their mistake. This is a defense mechanism whereby they keep the knowledge of their own possible, even likely, fate at bay.
	In these chapters, Henry is contrasted with two other characters. The first is the lieutenant. Henry considers himself to have a fine mind, and he contrasts himself with the lieutenant who roughly pushes him on faster. Henry regards the lieutenant as a mere brute. Later in the novel, however, this will change. The two men will find they have a lot in common and they will form a bond.
	Henry is also contrasted with Jim Conklin, who gives every appearance of being brave and confident, and with Wilson, who feels sorry for himself and expects to be killed. (But at least Wilson admits to Henry what he is feeling; Henry always keeps his thoughts to himself.)

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 5-7,"The enemy advances on Henry’s regiment, and the battle begins. Henry wonders whether his rifle is loaded, but then as he sees the foe swarming toward him in the field, he fires a wild shot. Then he gets caught up in the battle and feels a sense of brotherhood with his comrades. He also feels rage at the enemy and regrets that he can only use his rifle against one man at a time. A man tries to run, but is pushed back into the fray by the lieutenant. He is immediately grazed in the head by a shot. After a period of fighting, Henry realizes that the enemy has been repulsed. The men celebrate. Wounded men make their way to the rear.
	Henry feels very satisfied. He believes he performed heroically, and the men continue to congratulate each other. But then a shout goes up: the enemy is coming upon them again. Many of the men believe they will not be able to withstand this second assault. Henry feels physically weak, and finds that he is exaggerating the prowess of the enemy. He waits, horrified. He sees a few men fleeing, yells with fright, and runs too, as fast as he can, leaving his rifle behind. As he runs he fears death at any moment. He runs past the artillery gunners, and watches another brigade going to the relief of their comrades. When the noise of the battle subsides, he runs more slowly. He observes a harassed general on horseback. The general then gets word from an officer that the assault of the enemy has been repulsed.
	Henry cringes when he overhears this news. He is angry. He justifies his cowardice by telling himself that he did the right thing by saving himself, because at the time it seemed as if death was imminent. It was his duty to save himself. Had his comrades been more intelligent, they too would have realized that it made sense to abandon their position. He thinks they are fools and is angry with them. He walks deep into a wood to get away from the sounds of the battle, which is still going on in other areas. He climbs a tree, still insisting to himself that he was right to preserve his own life. Then he continues to walk in the forest. He encounters a dead soldier, shrieks at the gruesome sight, and then flees from it.
Analysis
	The events that lead to Henry’s act of cowardice have great psychological veracity. On his first engagement in battle, Henry performs adequately, as does almost everyone else in the new regiment. They naturally feel relief when the battle is over, and they relax and celebrate. When they become aware that the enemy is about to charge again, they are simply not mentally prepared for another battle. It is not what they are expecting. Their resolve the second time around is therefore much weaker. As Henry realized in the first stage of the battle, an army is a collective thing. If the regiment fights well, there is a kind of group momentum that carries everyone along with it. But the same applies in reverse. Henry does not run away in a vacuum. He first sees two other men running. Once the cohesion of the regiment is broken, it is no longer a single unit with what he called earlier a “common personality.” The contagion now works in the opposite direction; he runs because others are running. In neither case is he really acting as an individual; he is simply caught up in what is happening to the group.
	Henry’s attempts to justify his actions are also true to life. Like many a guilty person, he simply cannot admit to himself that he did something that was wrong or cowardly. For him to admit such a thing would make it almost impossible for him to go on living. So his mind spontaneously goes to work to convince him that in fact, he is the intelligent one who showed insight and foresight, and his comrades are the fools.
	There is also irony in the fact that Henry flees what he believes to be imminent defeat, only to find later that his side have triumphed. This makes his position even more difficult.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 8-10,"When twilight comes, Henry hears renewed sounds of fighting, and he runs in the direction of the battle, fully aware of how ironical this action is. But he runs just to witness the battle; he has no intention of getting involved in it again. He thinks of the war as like the grinding of an immense machine, and he must get close to it and watch it. He comes upon a procession of wounded men making their way to the rear. He falls in with them. A tattered soldier covered with grime and blood, and wounded in the head and arm, walks at Henry’s side and tries to befriend him. He tries to get Henry to agree with him that it had been a good fight. He says all the soldiers on their side fought hard. Then he asks Henry where he is wounded. Henry panics and turns away from the man. He slips off into the crowd.
	Henry finds other wounded men to walk with, but he now thinks that his shame must be visible. He wishes he had a wound too, a “red badge of courage” (ch. 9, p. 67). He walks alongside a man who is badly wounded and near death. With horror he realizes it is Jim Conklin. When Jim recognizes Henry, he says he was worried about him. Henry says he will take care of him, but the tattered soldier tells Henry that Jim has only a few more minutes to live. Henry watches as Jim goes through his last moments before falling to the ground dead. At the sight of his dead friend, Henry turns with rage in the direction of the battlefield and shakes his fist.
	The tattered soldier and Henry leave the corpse and start back on their way. Henry is worried that the soldier may also die, but the tattered soldier says he will not. After they have talked a while, the tattered soldier again asks Henry where his injury is located. He assumes it may be an internal injury, since Henry carries no visible wound. Henry becomes angry at the man and tells him not to bother him. Then Henry says goodbye and wanders off by himself. He wishes he was dead. He feels unable to keep his crime of cowardice concealed.
Analysis
	In these three chapters, Henry is continually confronted with his own conscience. Wherever he turns he cannot escape it. This is the role the tattered soldier plays. He acts as a prick to Henry’s conscience. The tattered soldier’s tales of how well the men fought, and how much he admires them, is an awful thing for Henry to hear, carrying as it does a terrible reproach for his own cowardice. But then it gets even worse. Given that his listener is Henry, there is deep irony in the tattered soldier’s tale of meeting a boy from Georgia who said that the Union boys would run once they heard a gun. “Well, they didn’t run t’day, did they, hey?” he says to Henry (ch. 8. p. 66). Of course, Henry can make no response. Then twice the tattered soldier asks Henry, in all good intent, where he is wounded. It seems that Henry cannot escape from being reminded of his act of cowardice. All the men he meets now have visible badges of courage—their bleeding wounds. Henry’s wound is indeed internal and invisible, as the tattered soldier believes, although what the soldier means by that is something quite different from the reality.
	The contrast between Jim and Henry reaches its starkest moment here. They have similar backgrounds. They have known each other since childhood. But Jim faced up to his responsibilities and paid the heaviest price a man can pay. No wonder Henry is tortured by grief at Jim’s fate, since it is inextricably mixed up with his own feelings of guilt, which can only become worse as a result of his friend’s death.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 11-12,"The noise of the battle grows louder and Henry watches a column of retreating men and wagons. Because they are retreating, he feels a kind of vindication of his own actions. Then he sees a column of infantry moving in the other direction, toward the battle. This fills him with misery. He feels he can never be like these men, who are filled with glory. But then for a few moments, he wants to join them, and he visualizes himself doing great deeds on the battlefield. Then he realizes how difficult such a course of action would be—he has no rifle, and does not know where his regiment is. His mind goes this way and that, until he abandons his plan to return to battle. At about this time he becomes conscious of the many ailments that afflict him. He has a raging thirst, every bone in his body aches, and he is hungry. He becomes even more despondent, and believes that he will never become a hero. But he still seeks moral vindication. He reasons that if his army has been defeated, this could have advantages for him. Whole regiments would be shattered and scattered; many brave men would have been forced to desert. He would then be able to appear as just like one of them—even better in fact, he reasons, since his superior powers of perception had enabled him to see the coming defeat much earlier than others, and to take the only appropriate action. Then his mind turns again, and he regards himself as a villain and wishes he was dead. He convinces himself that it is not possible that his army should be defeated, and he tries to think up a plausible story he could take back to his regiment to explain his absence. But he cannot invent a story that does not have holes in it, and he imagines the derision he will face from his comrades if he returns.
	Henry encounters more retreating soldiers coming fast in his direction. Soon he is in the midst of them. The scene is chaotic. Henry tries to talk to one of the men, but the man is in a rage and he hits Henry on the head with his rifle. Henry collapses on the ground and rises only with great difficulty. His head is bleeding. The scene is still chaotic, and he moves away from it. He can hear the sounds of a huge battle taking place and he hurries on as dusk comes, worrying about the wound he has sustained. His head feels swollen, and he gets very weary. Another soldier sees him and starts to walk with him. He is friendly, asks Henry a lot of questions and talks a lot, telling stories of the battle. He finds out which regiment Henry is in, and guides him back to it.
Analysis
	In these chapters Henry’s mind swings from one extreme to another. He has no stable point of reference. He does not know how he should think of himself, so he fluctuates between moral justifications of his act and bitter self-condemnation. He fully realizes the difficult position he is in, because he will surely be found out by his men if he should return to his regiment. At this point he is like a leaf in a breeze. He has fallen from the main branch of the tree and the wind now takes him wherever it will. He is no longer in control of his own life. He does not know who he is or what his role in life is to be. It is the lowest point in his fortunes.
	The soldier who helps Henry back to his regiment is never named. Henry does not even see his face. Since Henry’s return to his own regiment is the beginning of his rehabilitation, the incident with the friendly, unnamed soldier suggests that even in the midst of this terrible situation, a kind of mysterious grace is operating in Henry’s life. He is to be given a second chance.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 13-15,"Henry makes his way apprehensively to towards his old comrades. He fears the reception he may receive. The first soldier he encounters is his friend Wilson, who greets him warmly. He had assumed that Henry had been killed. Henry makes up a convincing tale about being separated from the regiment, being involved in terrible fighting, and getting shot. A corporal arrives and takes care of Henry. He dresses the wound and says it appears that Henry was grazed by a cannon ball. After the corporal leaves him, Henry sits on the ground observing the scene around him. Then Wilson arrives, and tries to help Henry by tying a wet, cool handkerchief around his swollen head. Wilson then gives Henry his own blankets, and will not listen to Henry’s protests about his generosity. Henry sleeps.
	He wakes in the morning and already there is a distant sound of battle. There are bugle calls and drum rolls. Wilson watches out for Henry’s needs as they gather around the camp fire for breakfast. Henry notices how much his formerly loud and aggressive friend has matured. He is quieter, more confident, less ready to quarrel. Wilson says the officers believe they have the rebels where they want them. He adds that he thinks they gave the opposing army a defeat the previous day. Henry replies that from where he was, it looked the other way round. Then he remembers Jim Conklin, and tells Wilson about his death. A quarrel springs up between three soldiers, and Wilson goes across to become the peacemaker. When he returns he comments to Henry that initially he had thought the regiment had lost half its men in the battle. But it turns out they had only been scattered, and were wandering around or fighting with other regiments. Most of them had now returned.
	Henry remembers the package Wilson gave to him, when the latter had spoken with self-pity about what he believed would be his imminent death in battle. But he decides not to give the package back to Wilson straightaway. He fears that at some point Wilson will expect Henry to tell him his adventures of the previous day, and the truth may come out. He realizes that his possession of the package gives him some power over Wilson, so he resolves to keep it. If anyone will be the subject of derision, he determines it will be Wilson, not himself. Now he considers himself safe from discovery, his self-confidence and self-respect return. He does not fear what may happen in the forthcoming battle. He again reassures himself that even though he had fled the previous day, he had done so with discretion and dignity, not like the other deserters. As Henry thinks these thoughts, Wilson approaches him, and in an embarrassed way asks for his package back. Henry does not make it difficult for him, and congratulates himself on his generosity. He feels superior to his friend.
Analysis
	It appears from the comments made by the corporal, and later by Wilson, that the number of men from Henry’s regiment who ran from the battle was high. This is clear from the corporal’s statement that he thought at first they had lost forty-two men, but many of them are now returning. He does not draw the conclusion that the men deserted. Nor does Wilson, when in a separate incident he says to Henry: “Th’regiment lost over half th’ men yesterday. . . . I thought a’ course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep a-comin’ back last night until it seems, after all, we didn’t lose but a few.” He goes on to explain that the regiment had been scattered, and many of the men believed lost had in fact been fighting with other regiments—just as Henry had done.
	The irony here is rich. Not only does Wilson not doubt Henry’s story, it seems not to occur to him that the men who were scattered in fact deserted. Although the truth that some men in the regiment are cowards is plain, no one is willing to draw that conclusion. Of course, this is very convenient for Henry and plays a part in restoring his confidence. He guesses he will not be found out.
	The maturing of Wilson after the battle is notable. The experience has changed him for the better. He no longer has to prove himself and is a better man as a result. Henry is observant enough to note the change. It is ironic, then, that Henry maneuvers himself into a position where he can feel superior to Wilson. This is the incident with the package. The reader will hardly feel that Henry is justified in his attitude. Wilson may have had a moment of self-pity but at least he did his duty. But now it is he who feels shame rather than Henry, who is busy puffing himself up with images of his own superiority and imagining all the great war stories he will tell, with himself at the center, when he returns home to family and friends.

Rumors spread that their army has been defeated. The regiment then marches through the woods, as Henry complains loudly about the incompetence of the generals. He and Wilson agree that the regiment fights hard. Wilson says they do not have any luck, and Henry persists in blaming the generals. But after another soldier makes a sarcastic remark to him, he feels threatened and keeps quiet. The troops halt in a clearing in the woods. They know a battle is imminent, and the lieutenant berates his men for arguing too much. There is rifle fire from the thicket in front of the regiment. The battle is upon them.
	Henry fumes with rage and exasperation. He wants to rest, not fight. As he waits with his fingers on his rifle, he conceives a hatred for the enemy. As the battle gets underway, he is conscious only of this hate, and his desire to crush the enemy. He determines to hold his position whatever happens, and he fires his rifle with ferocity. He does not even notice when there is a lull in the battle. He stands alone, still firing. When the smoke clears he sees that the ground ahead of him is deserted. The enemy has retreated. The lieutenant offers him high praise, and his comrades look admiringly on him as a “war devil.” When Henry reflects on what has happened, he is struck by how easy it was for him. He had fought like a beast, and become a hero. But he knows nothing of how it had all happened. As for the other men in the regiment, they are jubilant, and celebrate their victory with pride.
Analysis
	Henry continues to discover more about himself. Earlier, after long pondering the question of how he would react in a battle, he had found he was capable of an act of cowardice. Now, he shows he is also capable of acting courageously. He is so intent on the battle that he loses all sense of danger and is barely conscious of what he is doing. He discovers for himself the truth of what he had been told before he had ever tasted combat: “The youth had been taught that a man became another thing in a battle. He saw his salvation in such a change.” This reflection comes in chapter 3, just before the battle in which Henry runs away. As a coward, Henry was like a condemned man. Now, after his feats on the battlefield, he is like a man who has been saved.
	This section also marks the beginning of the bond that forms between Henry and the lieutenant. Earlier, Henry had regarded the lieutenant with distaste, as a crude man, quite the opposite of himself. But the lieutenant, whatever he may of thought of Henry, now regards him with admiration, saying that if he had ten thousand “wild cats” like Henry, he could win the war in less than a week.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 18-19,"During the lull in their portion of the battle, Henry and Wilson go in search of a stream in order to find some drinking water. They do not find a stream and start to make their way back. They take the opportunity to observe the battle, which continues fiercely. They overhear the general of their division talking with another officer. The general fears the enemy will break through at a place called Whiterside, unless he can get reinforcements. The officer says he can spare none of his men except those of the 304th regiment, which is the regiment to which Henry and Wilson belong. The officer refers to them as “mule drivers,” because they were recruited from farms. The general approves the plan, and says as the officer rides off that he does not expect many of these “mule drivers” to return from the tough mission he has given them. Henry feels angry at the impersonal, indifferent way such things are decided. He and Wilson return to their regiment and give the news that they will shortly be asked to make a charge. The men are skeptical at first of how Henry and Wilson know this, but then they accept it. The officers bustle around, preparing the regiment for battle.
	The charge begins. Henry plays his part with fierce determination. The regiment takes many casualties as the battle intensifies, but the men continue to advance. After some while they tire and the advance halts. They continue to take casualties. The lieutenant and the other officers urge them forward again. They advance into withering fire from the enemy, and then halt again. The lieutenant bellows that they cannot stay there; if they do they will all be killed. He tries to force Henry to continue the advance. At first Henry protests, but then he, the lieutenant and Wilson rush on ahead of the other men. They urge the others to follow, and soon the whole regiment is on the move again, facing intense hostile fire. The sergeant who carries the flag is killed, and Henry and Wilson grab the flag from his corpse.
Analysis
	These chapters are full of insights into the strange, contradictory nature of war. Henry for example notes with distaste the impersonal, unfeeling way in which a general is willing to sacrifice men. He thinks they are being used just like brooms to sweep up the woods. No attention is paid to their humanity. And yet when the battle starts and the men advance, Henry feels an unusual sense of being fully alive. All his senses function in a very acute way. It is almost as if he is lifted to another state of consciousness, so clear does everything become:
It seemed to the youth that he saw everything. Each blade of the green grass was bold and clear. He thought that he was aware of every change in the thin, transparent vapor that floated idly in sheets. The brown or gray trunks of the trees showed each roughness of their surfaces (ch. 19, p. 119).
Henry also seems to comprehend everything about his comrades as they go into battle. And yet, curiously, he is also ignorant. He does not know why he is there. He is in a strange state of knowledge and ignorance at the same time, and he notes this condition in the other men too. They too find the situation incomprehensible, but they are caught up in a kind of group consciousness that lifts them beyond selfishness and makes them a formidable fighting force. Beyond the reach of reason, they are more like animals, acting instinctively.
	There is also great heroism in this horrific environment. Henry as well as Wilson emerge as men of great courage and leadership. There can be few moment in literature as moving as when the two of them wrest the Union flag from the dead sergeant. But the moment is also grotesque, as the description of the dead sergeant shows. This is a realistic war novel, not an exercise in sentimental patriotism.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 20-22,"Henry and Wilson, as they carry the flag, are forced to retreat with the rest of the regiment. They fall back to the trees for cover. Then, with their ranks much depleted, they begin marching again. Once more they come under heavy fire. They become discouraged and feel betrayed by their officers. Henry is filled with anger against the officer who described their regiment as “mule drivers.” He and the lieutenant try hard to rally the men. But as the battle intensifies again, the regiment is in disarray. Henry, as the new color-bearer, holds the flag up firmly. Suddenly, the enemy is close and advancing upon them, step by step. Against all the odds, the Union soldiers beat them back. The men dance with joy. Their enthusiasm returns and they feel a new pride in themselves.
	In their part of the field there is a sudden stillness. The men feel free. They return to their own lines. Henry realizes that the distance they had covered was very small, and the battle must have lasted for only a short time. But he looks back with satisfaction at his own performance. He and the men then witness a confrontation between the officer who called them mule drivers and the colonel of the regiment. The officer says that if the men had advanced another hundred feet, it would have been a great effort. The colonel replies calmly that they advanced as far as they could. The officer rides away, and the lieutenant tells the colonel that anyone who says their men did not fight hard is a fool. The men are resentful at how the officer disparaged their efforts. Henry and Wilson discuss the injustice of it. Then another man brings some news. It turns out that when the colonel met the lieutenant, he wanted to know the name of the man who had carried the flag. After the lieutenant tells him, and praises Henry, the colonel says Henry is a good man to have. The lieutenant also has words of praise for Wilson. The colonel says they should both be major generals. When they hear this, Henry and Wilson are embarrassed, but secretly they are thrilled to be recognized and honored in such a way.
	In the lull in his regiment’s fighting, Henry takes the opportunity to observe the battles that are taking place elsewhere. Waves of troops engage each other in all directions. The noise is deafening. Then Henry’s own regiment is in action again, and performs with great valor. Henry is once again the standard-bearer. Casualties are high.
Analysis
	Henry’s experience has come full circle. When he first thought about war, as a young man before he even enlisted, his mind was filled with romantic, idealistic notions of glory. He imagined himself performing heroically in battle. Of course, when he enlisted, he found out that war was not such a glamorous adventure. He got bored marching for no apparent reason and sitting around in camps. War seemed the opposite of glory, and his former ideas foolish. Then of course came his moment of cowardice on the battlefield and his resulting confusion as he tried to live with the knowledge of how he had behaved when the pressure was on. He also had many thoughts about the insignificance and smallness of the individual in the face of such huge collective action as a war.
	But then, for reasons that Henry never fully understands, he
	genuinely becomes the hero he had once dreamed of being. He even discovers that the lowly infantryman is not always anonymous. His name is conveyed to his general, and he is praised by name. Now he can tell those war stories he imagined himself relating in chapter 15, when he had nothing at all to boast of, and they will be true. He really has been a “central figure in blazing scenes.”

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 23-24,"The officers call for a charge, and the men readily agree, even though the regiment has been severely weakened. They charge across a field toward a fence, behind which lies the enemy. Henry goes ahead with the flag, feeling joy and strength, and unconcerned about the bullets flying around him. He is in a kind of “wild battle madness.” Some of the enemy run; others hold fast. Henry sets his heart on capturing the enemy flag, but it is Wilson who accomplishes this task, immediately after the enemy standard-bearer is killed. The regiment drives the enemy back and takes four prisoners.
	The battle wanes. The men of Henry’s regiment march back to join the other Union forces. Their part in the battle is over. Henry reflects on his experience. He studies his successes and his failures. He rejoices in his feats of courage, and revels in the respect he has gained from his comrades. But he cannot forget his moment of shame, or the image of the tattered soldier deserted and left to wander in a field. He is haunted by this, and feels he may never forget it. But gradually he is able to put it behind him. He feels that as a result of the battle he has attained manhood. He looks forward to a more tranquil life.
Analysis
	The final charge is a stirring affair. The two armies are shown fighting at closer range than earlier; the struggle becomes more personal. As earlier descriptions have also shown, the individual soldier in battle is lifted beyond rational feeling into a realm of fanatical dedication. Henry feels like a “daring spirit of a savage religion-mad” (p. 141), and the men plunge on in an “exhibition of sublime recklessness.” The capturing of the enemy flag is a fitting climax to the battle, although the honor goes to Wilson not Henry.
	As a result of his war experience, Henry reaches a new maturity, just as Wilson had done earlier. He knows life is not all glory or shame, success or failure. It is a mixture. He has learned that he can redeem himself even after a grievous failing. He has also learned what it is to be a part of something bigger than himself. Although he felt joy in battle, he seems also to be aware that peace is more precious. Looking back on his experience, he views war as a “red sickness of battle,” a “sultry nightmare” which had turned him into an animal. He sees life more in a more balanced way now. The emphasis is on the “quiet manhood” he has attained, sturdy but not over-assertive. War has not corrupted him; it has made him wiser.

Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 1-Part 1 Chapter 2,"Part 1 Chapter 1-Part 1 Chapter 2
Part 1 Chapter 1: Dostoevsky immediately introduces us into the mind of his forty-year-old Underground Man, who describes himself as a ""sick"", ""spiteful"", ""most unpleasant man"" with a liver disease for which he refuses to seek treatment ""out of spite."" Throughout the man's speech, he addresses a formal audience he calls ""distinguished gentleman""-more out of sarcasm than respect.
	Yet this Underground Man's soliloquy is far from an elegant and polished masterpiece-much of it is confusing and almost incoherent.  The UM himself admits that some of this confusion is a result of his life's confusion-a life that swarms with ""contradictory elements"" that torment him constantly. 
	He is also a man who cannot act as others do.  Though he hates this spiteful part of him, this inability to ""become anything,"" he does, however, take some kind of pride (though also shame) in the fact that he is superior in intelligence to those around him.  He takes great pains to explain that because he is so intelligent, he is unable to act.  He will elaborate on this point in future chapters.
	Part 1 Chapter 2: In this chapter we learn that the UM's illness is more than physical: he asserts that he has a psychological disease-he has too much consciousness.  He admits that day after day he would rush home to hide in his ""corner,"" only to anguish and ""gnaw"" at himself, reconsidering the actions he had taken that day.  At the same time, however, he finds a kind of pleasure in the humiliation and even despair caused by this ""overly acute consciousness.""

Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 3-Part 1 Chapter 4,"Part 1 Chapter 3-Part 1 Chapter 4
Part 1 Chapter 3: The UM now uses an analogy to make his point.  He describes the normal, ""stupid"" person as an enraged bull rushing headlong into a wall at the slightest impulse.  He likens himself, one who possesses a hyperconsciousness, to a mouse-the antithesis of a normal man, he says.  While the bull acts on its rather simple mental reasoning, the mouse cannot act because its overly sophisticated mental processes perpetually plague it with doubt and vacillation, rendering him unable to do anything, save ""creep ignominiously back into its mousehole."" This hole, this underground, is the home of the UM and those like him.
	At the end of the chapter, the UM elaborates on the wall concept.  The wall represents, he explains, ""the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science and mathematics."" The wall also embodies such ideas as evolution, which Dostoevsky largely equated with atheism and socialism.  While the man of action readily accepts the wall and its implications, the UM (and Dostoevsky) can't come to grips with the concept of the stone wall, the idea that ""two times two makes four,"" because it makes man out to be an animal-a mere phenomenon of science, lacking the human component of free will.
	Part 1 Chapter 4: To advance his previous point that one can find pleasure in suffering, the UM uses the example of a toothache.  He explains that though there is absolutely no rational motive for finding enjoyment in one's pain, realizing that one can make such an irrational decision is in and of itself a cause for certain satisfaction.

Part 1 Chapter 5: Here we delve deeper into the mind of this deeply disturbed individual.  The UM, explaining what it was like to grow up, says that he could never find any virtue or justice in his world, and therefore could only use spite or conscious deception to find reasons to act.
	Part 1 Chapter 6: Here, the Underground Man sidetracks himself, explaining how if he were a sluggard then he would truly respect himself.  He muses about how his life would be different if only he could call himself a lazy drunk who devoted his life to the ""beautiful and sublime."" In fact, he mentions and quotes the words ""beautiful and sublime"" so often in this chapter that the words quickly become a sardonic attack on the utopian ideals Dostoevsky and his UM so despised.

Part 1 Chapter 7: The UM more clearly focuses his assault on Chernyshevsky's ""golden dreams"" in this chapter, where he asserts that man is an inherently irrational creature (he cites human history, including the American Civil War, which was in progress during the time he was writing), and therefore does not always act in his own self-interest.  Indeed, the Underground Man asks, ""And what if it turns out that man's advantage sometimes not only may, but even must in certain circumstances, consist precisely in his desiring something harmful to himself instead of something advantageous?"" Freedom to act against the laws of nature, against the crystal palace of reason, is the advantage the UM sees above all others.  The UM goes on: ""Man needs only one thing-his own independentdesire, whatever that independence might cost and wherever it might lead.""
	Part 1 Chapter 8: Next, he confronts the counter-argument that man's ""free will"" is just an illusion-just a scientific formula of biological chemicals.  The UM says that if this were ever the case, man would cease being human altogether and become an organ stop.  Later, he even suggests that this liberty of choice, this freedom to be stupid, is a right.

Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 9-Part 1 Chapter 10,"Part 1 Chapter 9: Next, the UM uses the analogy of the road to present his conclusion that man is afraid of completing his goal.  Man, he argues, loves the act of building, or constructing the road, but not the final product of the finished road.  It then follows that humans fear the law of determinism-that two and two makes four.  The UM dreads the prospect that humans will find this reason-this crystal palace, because then there will be nothing left for mankind to seek, nothing else for which to strive, nothing else for which to live.
	Part 1 Chapter 10: In this chapter, the Underground Man explains his refusal to accept the crystal palace, for the very reason that he wouldn't be able to stick his tongue out at it.  He would much rather live in his self-acclaimed underground.

Part 1 Chapter 11: The UM begins this chapter by proclaiming: ""The final result, gentlemen, is that it's better to do nothing! Conscious inertia is better! And so, long live the underground!"" Yet quickly he admits that he's lying, that he doesn't truly prefer the underground, but ""something different, altogether different, something that I long for, but I'll never be able to find!""
	He also says that he doesn't believe a word that he has just said, which makes the reader wonder about the man's sanity.  Yet this is all part of the psychology of the underground, and with some personal musings about why he has just written this ""speech"" down on paper, the Underground Man launches into part two-Apropos of Wet Snow.
	Part 2 Chapter 1: The Underground Man flashes back to when he was only twenty-four years old.  He explains that even at that early age (remember the first part was written when he was forty) his life was ""gloomy, disordered, and solitary to the point of savagery."" Speaking about his work environment, he admits that he hated all of his co-workers, though he probably despised himself even more so.  The attack against the man of action in part one is resurrected in this chapter, when the UM explains that ""only asses and their mongrels are brags, and even then, only until they come up against a wall.""
	Though he wishes to interact with others and perhaps even have normal relations with his fellow human beings, the UM's hyperconsciousness, as in part one, makes this impossible.  He spends most of his time reading, hoping it will keep his mind busy working on external problems.
	One night he passes a tavern, only to see some men quarreling and one even being tossed out of the window.  Though he meekly tries to get into a fight himself, hoping to be thrown out in the same way, he isn't successful and leaves the establishment unsatisfied.  But he takes great pains to explain that he left not out of cowardice, but out of vanity.  He wasn't afraid of being physically humiliated, indeed he longed for it.  What he feared was that he wouldn't be understood, that his supreme ""literary"" genius wouldn't be recognized or respected, and that he would be treated as the insignificant little fly that he considers himself.  He remembers the officer who ignored his presence when he tried to start the fight, however.  He stalks this man, finding out all about him, hoping to challenge him to a duel.  Every day he imagines that as the two of them pass each other on the street, he will intentionally bump the man, instead of yielding to him as he always does.  One day the UM finally does find the resolve to carry out his mission, and the two bump shoulders.  Though the officer pretends that he doesn't notice the incident, the UM knows that he does notice, and he declares victory for having ""publicly placed [himself] on an equal social footing with him.""

Part 2 Chapter 2: Dreaming is the only method the UM now finds to escape his life of ""debauchery"" and enter the world of the ""beautiful and sublime."" He says that he dreamt for three months straight, and this dreaming was quite satisfying and even intoxicating, he admits.  He explains that he would go from considering himself to be a hero (in his dreams), to believing himself to be nothing but dirt, shifting from dominating over others to being dominated by them.  In these fantasies, he finds a love for humanity, and soon he wants to exhibit this love in the real world.  So growing restless of this dream-life, he decides to enter society, meaning he plans to visit an old schoolmate named Simonov.

Finally after all the preparations have been made, the UM invites himself to their gathering, much to their chagrin.
	That night he has horrible dreams about his childhood school experiences, where he is alienated from his classmates-by conscious choice of course.  These dreams set up an important contrast to the previous ""beautiful and sublime"" dreams he had been having over the previous three months.  Though he had imagined that mankind would embrace him and show him the love he found in his dreams, his overly acute conscious realizes that such fantasies will not be found in the real world, that society will not show him the love he desires.

	The UM is fascinated by her, however, and tries to philosophize to her, rebuking her for making herself into a slave and imploring her to give up the loathsome profession and get married.  Soon he also tells about himself and how he didn't have a family growing up.  This, he says, is why he has become ""so unfeeling.""

A Tale of Two Cities: Summary,"
Book I Chapter 1-4
The narrator begins his story in the year 1775 with the observation that ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" and concludes that it was a period in all respects much like the one nearly 70 years later from which the tale is being told. The narrator observes that there were kings and queens in England and France and that the aristocrats in both countries found little reason to expect any change in their status. At this time the English Crown received reports of unrest from its American colonies and in France the aristocracy continued its trend of overspending at the expense of its working poor. Criminals in both countries were dealt harsh physical punishment for even the smallest of crimes. In England, there were frequent highway robberies and corruption allowed the practice to flourish.
On a particularly foggy night in 1775 the mail coach from London to Dover is struggling up a muddy hill. The coach's three nervous passengers walk beside the coach in order to lighten the load for the horses on the grade. The passengers are thickly wrapped and unrecognizable in the fog. Finally, the coach reaches the summit and as the coachmen opens the door for the passengers he hears the sound of a horse approaching. He draws his pistol and expects the worst. Amid much anxiety and suspicion the approaching rider requests an audience with Mr. Jarvis Lorry, one of the passengers, who identifies himself and asks if the rider is a man named Jerry. Learning that this is the case, Mr. Lorry reassures the skittish coach drivers and receives the written message. Mr. Lorry identifies himself to the drivers as a member of Tellson's Bank of London on his way to that company's Paris branch. He reads aloud the brief message: ""Wait at Dover for Mam'selle"" and sends the brief reply, ""Recalled to life."" Jerry departs for London, by way of several roadside ale-houses, with the strange answer and the coach continues on to Dover. As he rides, Jerry muses that he would be in a ""bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion.""
Back in the coach, Mr. Lorry holds onto a leather strap, which secures him against the jolting road and allows him to fitfully doze during the journey. He dreams that he is walking in the underground storerooms of Tellson's but in the dream he knows that he is going to dig someone out of their grave. He inquires several times of the spectre how many years it remained entombed and receives the unvarying answer: ""Almost eighteen years."" When he asks the apparition if it is glad to be recalled to life, it answers, ""I can't say."" In the dream he digs to free the buried man but just as the body is unearthed it crumbles to dust. Mr. Lorry awakes in the coach and lowers the window to feel the real rain and mist on his face. The dream repeats often during the journey until Mr. Lorry realizes that the day is breaking.
At noon, when the mail coach reaches Dover, Mr. Lorry is the only remaining passenger because the other two men alighted at points along the road. After confirming that a packet ship will leave for Calais, France the following day, Mr. Lorry instructs the head drawer at the Royal George hotel to prepare a bedroom for himself and orders a barber and breakfast. Mr. Lorry emerges from his room clean and shaven and is revealed to be of about sixty years of age and formally dressed in a plain and worn but well-cared-for suit. He takes his breakfast alone before the fire and briefly dozes before his meal arrives. He instructs the drawer to prepare lodgings for a young lady who may arrive at any time that day. A brief but friendly exchange with the waiter reveals that there is much traveling between Tellson's branches, though Mr. Lorry himself has not traveled to Paris in nearly fifteen years. Mr. Lorry spends the day walking the beach, alone with his thoughts. That evening after dinner orders a bottle of claret and just before finishing the wine he hears the sound of an approaching carriage and rightly surmises that it is the Mam'selle he has been expecting. The waiter announces her as Miss Manette and conveys her wish to see him immediately.
Mr. Lorry follows the waiter to a darkly furnished room where he meets Miss Manette, a very pretty girl about seventeen years old. He is reminded of a little girl he carried in his arms aboard the packet from Calais to England many years before. Miss Manette relates that she has received a message informing her that a recent discovery regarding her deceased father (whom she never saw in life) has been made and that she must travel to her native land of France. She asks if she may place herself under Mr. Lorry's protection for the journey and he readily assents. She was told that the discovery is of a very surprising nature and that the bank's representative, namely Mr. Lorry, would reveal it to her. Mr. Lorry is somewhat disconcerted at the prospect but begins to relate the story of one of his customers when he worked at Tellson's French branch nearly twenty years prior. Miss Manette soon discerns that Mr. Lorry is speaking of her own father, a man of science, and she also gleans that it was Mr. Lorry himself who brought her to England soon after her mother's subsequent death. Mr. Lorry admits that all that is true but asserts that he is a man of business and his relations with people are business in nature and devoid of strong emotional attachment. He continues his story by suggesting that the fictional character he has invented to stand in the place of Dr. Manette did not die but instead imprisoned with no appeal or outside communication. This information causes Miss Manette to swoon with emotion, but she begs Mr. Lorry to continue his story. After appealing to her to be business-minded about the affair, Mr. Lorry proceeds to tell her that her father has been found alive but greatly affected and changed by long years of imprisonment. Miss Manette reflects that she will be going to see a ghost but Mr. Lorry encourages her to be strong and that perhaps her influence will bring her poor father to reason. He tells her that her father is now under another name and she should not speak his true name aloud while in France, but he then notices that she is not listening but has sunk into a chair and become catatonic.
Mr. Lorry calls for help and a large, redheaded woman, Lucie's guardian Miss Pross, comes running into the room and shoves him away. She orders smelling salts, cold water and vinegar and affectionately fawns over Miss Manette. She castigates the flummoxed man of finances for frightening such a fragile girl.

Chapter 1-4
The narrator begins his story in the year 1775 with the observation that ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" and concludes that it was a period in all respects much like the one nearly 70 years later from which the tale is being told. The narrator observes that there were kings and queens in England and France and that the aristocrats in both countries found little reason to expect any change in their status. At this time the English Crown received reports of unrest from its American colonies and in France the aristocracy continued its trend of overspending at the expense of its working poor. Criminals in both countries were dealt harsh physical punishment for even the smallest of crimes. In England, there were frequent highway robberies and corruption allowed the practice to flourish.
On a particularly foggy night in 1775 the mail coach from London to Dover is struggling up a muddy hill. The coach's three nervous passengers walk beside the coach in order to lighten the load for the horses on the grade. The passengers are thickly wrapped and unrecognizable in the fog. Finally, the coach reaches the summit and as the coachmen opens the door for the passengers he hears the sound of a horse approaching. He draws his pistol and expects the worst. Amid much anxiety and suspicion the approaching rider requests an audience with Mr. Jarvis Lorry, one of the passengers, who identifies himself and asks if the rider is a man named Jerry. Learning that this is the case, Mr. Lorry reassures the skittish coach drivers and receives the written message. Mr. Lorry identifies himself to the drivers as a member of Tellson's Bank of London on his way to that company's Paris branch. He reads aloud the brief message: ""Wait at Dover for Mam'selle"" and sends the brief reply, ""Recalled to life."" Jerry departs for London, by way of several roadside ale-houses, with the strange answer and the coach continues on to Dover. As he rides, Jerry muses that he would be in a ""bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion.""
Back in the coach, Mr. Lorry holds onto a leather strap, which secures him against the jolting road and allows him to fitfully doze during the journey.

Chapter 5-6
The scene is the squalid street outside a wine shop in the poverty-stricken Saint Antoine district of Paris. A cask of red wine has been spilled in the street and hungry peasants use various means to sop and drink the mixture of wine and mud before it soaks away. The narrator describes these people as desperate and haggard from long years of deprivation and hunger. One of the peasants, a tall joker named Gaspard, uses the wine to write the word ""BLOOD"" on a wall but the owner of the wine shop, Monsieur Defarge, fails to appreciate the intended humor and rubs out the word with some mud. Monsieur Defarge returns to his shop where his wife sits with her knitting at rest while she picks her teeth. She gives a short cough to let her husband know to look about the shop for some new customers. He sees an older man and a young girl sitting in the back of the shop but ignores them for the moment in order to discourse with three men drinking at the counter. They exchange doleful observations of the wretched condition of the people and refer to each other by the name ""Jacques."" Monsieur Defarge offers to show the three men a bachelor-style apartment on the fifth floor but then remembers that one of them has been there before and can lead the others to it. After the Jacques depart, the elderly man approaches Defarge. The elderly man is Mr. Lorry and as he and Miss Manette follow Defarge up a steep staircase he makes several inquiries regarding the health of Miss Manette's father who is living in the garret. Mr. Lorry is dispirited by Defarge's response. At the top Mr. Lorry is surprised to find that Defarge must use a key to open the door but Defarge observes that the former prisoner would be frightened if left in an unlocked room. Miss Manette is afraid to enter but Mr. Lorry admonishes her to have courage and see to the business at hand. They come upon the three men from the shop looking through a chink in the wall and Mr. Lorry, somewhat angrily, asks Defarge the why he chooses to make a show of Dr. Manette. Defarge replies that it is best if some select people see the doctor. They enter the dim and dark apartment where an old man with white hair is bent before the feeble light of a solitary window making shoes.
Defarge opens the window wider and the additional light reveals the haggard dress and sunken visage of the shoemaker who returns to his work. Mr. Lorry comes near the man and Defarge prompts the shoemaker to describe his work while Mr. Lorry examines the shoe. At Defarge's prompting, the shoemaker gives his name as ""One Hundred and Five, North Tower."" Upon further prompting the shoemaker reveals that he became a shoemaker only after many requests to teach himself the trade and even then with much difficulty. Mr. Lorry calls the shoemaker by name, Monsieur Manette, and the old man drops his work and briefly struggles to remember his visitor but soon returns to his work. During this conversation, Miss Manette moves through the shadows to a position near her father who eventually notices her. He is deeply affected by the sight of her and though he does not know who she is he examines her hair. He pulls from around his neck a locket with a few strands of hair like her own and tries to figure out who she might be. Finally he decides that she cannot be his wife and asks her name. He is deeply affected by the sound of his voice as she explains with great emotion that she has come to take him to England. By the end of her speech his head is resting on her breast and the pair have collapsed to the floor. With her father cradled in her arms, Miss Manette beseeches Mr. Lorry to prepare their departure immediately. Mr. Lorry and Defarge leave to obtain the necessary papers and transportation. The daughter and father are left alone for some time and then Mr. Lorry and Defarge return with food and traveling cloaks. Though Dr. Manette is evidentially comforted by his daughter's presence he is bewildered and believes himself to be leaving the prison as they depart the shop. They succeed in transferring Dr. Manette to a waiting coach but he then asks for his shoemaking tools. Madame Defarge, who stands nearby but ""saw nothing"", retrieves the tools from the garret. They quickly make their way to the Barrier where Defarge leaves them to their journey. They travel all night under stars that, just before dawn, seem to ask Mr. Lorry the same question: ""I hope you care to be recalled to life"" but he receives the same reply: ""I can't say.""
Analysis of Chapters 5-6
This section describes the miserable condition of the peasants in Paris during the period and Gaspard's graffiti foreshadows the revolution that is soon to come. The Defarge's wine shop is revealed to be more than simply a drinking house in the society of Jacques that meet there and the obvious understanding between Defarge and his wife hints at the deeper role they will play in the coming violence. Monsieur Defarge's insistence that some men are better for having seen the wretched condition of doctor Manette also serves to illustrate the work he is doing to proliferate discontent among those who would organize the overthrow of the current system. Miss Manette's instant connection with her father belies their shared blood and brings the first ray of hope into the miserable doctor's bleak existence. Doctor Manette's attempts to understand his daughter's identity are the first steps he takes in recovering his senses though Mr. Lorry's dream that the unearthed man still cannot say whether or not he cares to be recalled to life belies the uncertainty of that recovery and the various trials that the doctor will undergo if he is to return to normal.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book I Chapter 5-6,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 1-3
It is five years later, the year 1780, and Tellson's Bank of London remains an old-fashioned place, proud of its smallness, darkness, ugliness and inconveniences. The old partners in the firm suffer no improvements and in this way mirror England as a whole. Death is meted out for all offenses, whether it be unlawfully opening a letter or stealing a horse. Though this policy increases rather than decreases crime it has the very satisfactory effect of dispensing with each case forever. All the men who work at Tellson's are old. The bank employs an odd-job man, named Jerry Cruncher, who waits outside its door ready at a moment's notice for whatever errand that he is assigned. While he is on these errands his son (age twelve) waits in his father's place. Mr. Cruncher's apartment, which he shares with his wife and son, consists of two cramped rooms that are very neatly kept by Mrs. Cruncher (first name Aggerawayter). He awakes one morning in 1780 to find his wife praying, or as he indecorously calls it ""flopping"", which he claims works against him. He throws a muddy boot at his wife and advises his son that his mother is praying away their income and food. The boy keeps an eye on his mother while his father cleans his unaccountably muddy boots. At breakfast, Jerry angrily stops his wife from saying a blessing over the meal claiming he won't have his ""wittles blest off [the] table."" Just before nine o'clock he and young Jerry (who like his father has spikes of hair upon his head) encamp themselves in front of Tellson's to wait for any work that might arise. Soon there comes a call for a porter and the elder Cruncher leaves the younger to ponder why his father always has iron rust on his hands.
Jerry is sent to the Old Bailey courthouse with a message for Mr. Lorry. He is instructed to make his presence known and then wait until Mr. Lorry needs him. Before Jerry leaves the clerk tells him that the Bailey is trying treason cases that day. Jerry observes that the punishment for that offense is quartering which he calls ""barbarous."" The old clerk responds that Jerry had better respect the law which is immutable and for the best. Using the note provided by the clerk, Jerry gains admittance to the courtroom (a privilege for which most people paid money) and is informed that the man to stand trial will most assuredly be found guilty. As instructed, he attracts Mr. Lorry's attention and then waits to be entertained by the trial.
When the prisoner enters the room everyone carefully examines him except a wigged gentleman sitting with the defense counsel. This man stares at the ceiling. The accused man is about twenty-five years old with dark good looks and the bearing of a gentleman. The judge announces that the accused, Charles Darnay by name, has pled ""Not Guilty"" against charges that he is a traitor in the service of the French king. The prisoner's eyes stray, and those of the spectators with them, to a young woman and her father who are seated beside the Judge's bench. The young woman obviously sympathizes with the prisoner. The spectators wonder who the father and daughter are and what part they will play in the trial. Standing far in the back of the room, Jerry learns that the father and daughter are called there as witnesses for the prosecution.
Using very grand language, the prosecuting Attorney General states that the prisoner has been engaged in traitorous activities against their king and that the prosecution will produce unimpeachable, patriotic witnesses to attest to the prisoner's guilt. Furthermore, the Attorney General states that these witnesses have procured treasonous documents that, though admittedly not in the prisoner's handwriting, will prove that the prisoner has been monitoring the England's military forces for at least five years.
Several witnesses are called. The first is a man named John Barsad, who claims to be a gentleman and corroborates the Attorney General's assertion. Upon being cross-examined, however, he is revealed to be a gambler and is made to seem ridiculous when he is made to recall being pushed for cheating and then falling down a staircase on his own volition. The defense attorney implies that Barsad may hope to profit by his testimony by receiving employment as a government spy. The next witness, the prisoner's former servant Roger Cly, also asserts that his motives in procuring the lists were purely patriotic. He testifies that the prisoner has traveled between England and France often. The defense casts suspicion upon his motives, however, when it reveals that Cly has known John Barsad much longer than he has served the accused man. The third witness is Mr. Lorry who is unable to say whether the prisoner was one of the men who shared the Dover mail coach five years before but testifies that Darnay did come aboard the return ship from France soon after midnight when he returned with Lucie and Doctor Manette. The Attorney General questions Miss Manette and she testifies that the prisoner helped her find shelter for her father and was very kind and considerate at the time. Under questioning she is forced to admit that she did witness the prisoner exchange some papers with some French gentlemen before boarding the ship and that while on board he made a joke about George Washington achieving as much fame as the English King George III. Dr. Manette is questioned about the journey but admits that he can not remember the crossing due to mental sickness at the time. The prosecution then tries to prove that Darnay took the Dover mail coach and alighted early in order to glean the strength of a nearby garrison. The last witness is a man who swears that on the night in question he saw the prisoner in a particular coffee-room near Dover. The wigged gentleman staring at the ceiling passes a note to the defense attorney who, after reading the note, asks the witness if his learned friend who just passed him the note looks just like the prisoner. Everyone in the courtroom is immediately struck by the previously unnoticed similarity, and the witness admits that the man does resemble Darnay. The judge asks Mr. Stryver (the defense attorney) if the purpose of this is to put his partner Mr. Carton on trial and Mr. Stryver replies that he is attempting to cast doubt upon the witness' memory. The similarity between the two men succeeds in destroying the witness' credibility.
The defense and prosecution sum up their cases and the judge, who obviously favors the prosecution, adds his observations. Jerry Cruncher remarks to his neighbor that Mr. Carton, who continues to look at the ceiling, probably doesn't get much law work. At this moment, Mr. Carton cries out that Miss Manette is in danger of fainting. She and her father are escorted from the room and the jury, unable to reach an immediate decision, retires to consider its verdict. Mr. Carton asks Mr. Lorry about the young lady's condition and learns that she will recover. He offers to take this information to the prisoner. Carton asks Darnay what verdict he expects to receive. Mr. Carton agrees with Darnay that it would be best to expect the worst, but offers the observation that the jury's failure to reach an immediate verdict should be taken as a positive sign. An hour and a half later the jury returns and Mr. Lorry calls for Jerry to take the message ""ACQUITTED"" back to Tellson's.
Analysis of Chapters 1-3
This section serves to introduce Jerry Cruncher, a decidedly comic figure but also a representation of the English urban peasantry at the time. He is a relatively simple man who is seemingly content and vigilant in his position as Tellson's only trusted messenger. He is determined to provide food for himself and his family and the hints, such as the rust on his hands or mud on his boots, that he may have a more dishonorable occupation as well, that he has another, secret occupation serve to underscore his devotion to his stomach. Significantly, Dickens uses Cruncher as his perspective on Charles Darnay's theater-like trial, which is portrayed to be little more than entertainment for the mob. As such, Charles Darnay's trial is a grand play attended by a rapt audience with only Sydney Carton uninterested in the result. Carton displays interest in his surroundings first when he notices the similarity between himself and Charles Darnay and later when he notices that Miss Manette is about to faint. In both instances his thoughts can be attributed to where his interest most lies, namely himself and his desires. His later dialogue with Darnay reveals that he considers himself to be beyond redemption and, as such, free to give his opinion with regard for another's welfare or feelings.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 1-3,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 4-5
Outside the court Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry discuss the trial. After kissing Lucie's hand, Mr. Darnay thanks Mr. Stryver who has pushed his way into the group. Mr. Lorry sees Dr. Manette look somewhat fearfully and curiously at Charles Darnay. Soon the doctor and his daughter depart. Sydney Carton approaches the group. He is a little drunk and smells of port wine. Mr. Carton upsets Mr. Lorry by explaining that he, Mr. Carton, has no business and even that even if he did he would not attend to it. Mr. Lorry asserts that business is what guides one's life and departs in a huff. Sydney Carton takes Darnay to a nearby tavern to dine and drink. Carton proceeds to get more inebriated and chides Darnay for the obvious affection that Lucie Manette showed for him on the stand. His line of questioning leads to the assertion that he doesn't particularly care for Darnay. Before Darnay departs, Sydney Carton confides to him that he is a drunk because he cares for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for him. After Darnay leaves he orders another pint of port and gives orders to be awoken at 10pm. He questions himself in a mirror and tells himself that he hates Darnay because the remarkable similarity in their appearance reminds him of what he has not become. He falls asleep on his arm at the table.
The narrator observes that those were drinking days in London and Mr. Stryver, who was tireless in his pursuit of professional success and advancement, was like his counterpart Sydney Carton a heavy drinker. Carton rendered service to Stryver in all night drinking sessions where he would review Carton's upcoming cases and distill the essence from the various statements, a task his friend was intellectually ill equipped to perform himself. In this way Sydney Carton was the jackal to Mr. Stryver's lion. After being awoken by the waiter at 10pm, Sydney Carton made his way to Stryver's apartment where the two engaged in a long night of drinking while Carton poured over case briefs. While Stryver reclined on the sofa and drank at ease, Carton draped himself in cool wet towels and doggedly drank alcoholic punch and did his work. At three in the morning, the work complete, the two friends discuss the differences in the their nature and recall the days they spent as students in Paris. Before Carton leaves, Stryver asks what he thought of the pretty Miss Manette and is surprised to hear his morose friend's assertion that she was not very pretty. Carton walks home alone through the cold streets and falls asleep in his rarely used bed.
Analysis of Chapters 4-5
These chapters serve to flesh out the character of Sydney Carton. His discussion with Darnay demonstrates that although the two are alike in appearance their demeanors are very different. While Darnay eats, Carton drinks and whereas Darnay is polite and tempers his responses, Carton's comments are caustic, fueled by alcohol and a general dissatisfaction with life. The second half of Carton's evening, spent at Mr. Stryver's apartment, illustrates Carton's genius with the law and his complete willingness to let his partner take the credit for his own work. Though, as Mr. Stryver notes, In these descriptions, the reader is given the impression of a man who feels unloved, uninspired and for lack of any other attractive alternative, satisfied with simply doing his partner's work. Their discussion reveals that they have known each other since their school days and that Stryver has always been pushing his way to the front ranks. ""You were always somewhere,"" observes Carton, ""and I was always - nowhere."" They are opposites and together they seem to be prospering. Their partnership is depicted as a friendly union that neither man seems impelled to break. Sydney Carton's dismissal of Miss Manette's beauty, something, which has obviously affected him, reveals that he is not devoid of sensitivity and yearning for a higher purpose.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 4-5,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 6
Four months pass. Mr. Lorry is in the habit of visiting Lucie and Dr. Manette in their pleasant Soho home on Sunday afternoons. Dr. Manette practices medicine from his house and has earned a reputation as a shrewd and vigilant scientist. On an exceptionally fine Sunday Mr. Lorry arrives at the Manette residence and is told that Dr. and Miss Manette are out but will return shortly. Mr. Lorry goes upstairs to wait. He notices that Dr. Manette's old shoe making tools sit unused in the Doctor's bedroom. Miss Pross enters and they engage in a sharp but friendly conversation about the people who come to visit Lucie. Miss Pross is afraid that Lucie's affections will be taken from her and she asserts that none of the callers are as good for her as Miss Pross' estranged brother, Solomon, whom Mr. Lorry knows to be a dishonest scoundrel. Mr. Lorry questions Miss Pross about Dr. Manette's health and asks why he has not disposed of the shoemaking bench and tools. Miss Pross posits the theory that the Doctor is afraid of losing his mind again. She observes that the doctor shies away from any discussion of his imprisonment. She confides that sometimes the doctor paces the floor in the night and Lucie walks with him until he is composed. At that moment the house, which is so situated on street that any footsteps in the street echo loudly within, begins to resound with the approach of Lucie and Doctor Manette. The group has a pleasant dinner and then, owing to the heat of the evening, they sit under the plane tree and drink wine. Mr. Darnay joins them and in the course of conversation tells them of a story he heard regarding some buried scraps of paper found in the Tower (prison) that had been interred long ago by an inmate but were deteriorated and could not be deciphered. Doctor Manette is visibly upset by the story but claims that his consternation is result of the rain that has begun to fall. The group goes inside for tea where Mr. Carton joins them. The drops of rain continue to fall with greater frequency and as they listen to the echoes of unseen people's footsteps rushing in the street Lucie remarks on her fancy that when she listens to the footsteps she imagines that they represent the hundreds of people who will enter their lives. A great thunderstorm breaks and it is one o'clock in the morning before it has cleared sufficiently for Mr. Lorry to walk home with Jerry as an escort.

This chapter establishes the close knit-ties among the Manettes, Charles Darnay, Miss Pross and Mr. Lorry. Mr. Lorry is accepted as a surrogate uncle and Miss Pross, though she affects to be in their service, is very much part of the ""family"". Sydney Carton's presence indicates that he also feels comfortable paying the Manette's a visit but his aloof and morose demeanor, while accepted among the group, establishes emotional distance between him and the others. Charles Darnay's story about the discovered manuscript obviously upsets the doctor and foreshadows the discovery of a different manuscript that the doctor has either forgotten or is trying to forget at the time. Lucie's interpretation of the echoing footsteps also serves to foreshadow the footsteps of the Paris mob that will soon enter all their lives.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 6,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 7-9
In Paris, Monseigneur (who is identified only as one of the upper echelons of the French royal court's aristocracy) is holding one of his regular receptions at his Grand Hotel. The Monseigneur is in his private chamber with the four men required to properly serve him his chocolate. The narrator describes the opulence of Monseigneur's lifestyle, filled with parties and theater, and sums up the nobles' idea of public business as ""let everything go on its own way"" and most especially to let it go his, the Monseigneur's, own way. We are told that, lacking aptitude for managing finances and in danger of growing poor, the Monseigneur took his sister out of a convent and married her to a rich Farmer-General who desired the status associated with the Monseigneur's royal name. Waiting in the main rooms is the usual assemblage of well-connected people who the narrator characterizes as being useless in their avowed specialties. Everyone is wonderfully and richly dressed. Eventually Monseigneur condescends to move among his guests and he is much fawned over before he returns to his private chamber. Eventually only one visitor is left, a man of about sixty with fine features, who is not in the Monseigneur's favor and pauses to offer a curse in the direction of the private chamber before leaving.
The man's carriage rushes through the narrow streets without regard to the safety of the peasants who flee to avoid its wheels. There is a jolt and a cry and the horses rear and stop. The passenger, who is recognized by the newly formed crowd as Monsieur the Marquis, discovers that his carriage has run over a small child and the father, is now weeping over the body of his dead son. The Marquis admonishes the people to keep out of the way of carriages, suggests that his horses might have been injured and throws a gold coin to the moaning father. Another man arrives and calls the bereaved father by name, Gaspard, and comforts him that life is miserable and his son is best shut of it. The Marquis overhears and asks the man's name that he learns is Defarge. The Marquis throws Defarge a gold coin as well but as he is being driven away he is shocked when someone throws a gold coin into his carriage. He stops and angrily yells at the crowd but sees only a stout woman with her knitting where Defarge had been. The Marquis rides on and is followed by other carriages from the fancy ball. The narrator compares the watching peasants to rats who must return to their holes.
The Monsieur the Marquis' carriage is making its way slowly up a country hill on its way to his chateau. The countryside is full of sparse, underdeveloped fields. Eventually the carriage reaches the small village near the Marquis' home. The people of the village are downtrodden, hungry and burdened with heavy taxes. A prison looks down upon the village from a nearby crag. The Marquis questions a man who he saw looking at his carriage as it came up the hill and learns, to his anger, that a man covered in white dust who is stranger in the region had been suspended under his carriage. The Marquis continues to his mansion and is stopped en route by a poor woman who has just buried her husband who died from want. She begs for a small stone engraved with her husband's name to mark his grave but the Marquis ignores her petition and drives on. When he arrives at his chateau he learns that his nephew, Monsieur Charles from England, has not yet arrived.
The chateau is made of stone and its walls contain numerous carvings of flowers, men and animals. The Marquis makes his way through the richly furnished chateau to his private chambers where settings for two diners have been laid. Halfway through his supper the Marquis' nephew arrives from England. The Marquis' nephew is Charles Darnay. The two men have a conversation during the course of which is becomes apparent that Charles, attempting to gratify the last wish of his dead mother, has refuted his aristocratic family and rejected all that it stands for. He accuses his uncle of committing great wrongs against the people with the aid of his dead father, who was the Marquis' twin brother. Charles also asserts that the Marquis, if he were not currently in disfavor at the Court, would have had him imprisoned long ago. The Marquis seems amused by Charles' accusations and does not deny them. Rather, he seems proud of his station and the acrimony of the French peasants. ""Detestation of the high,"" he tells his nephew, ""is the involuntary homage of the low."" Charles again asserts that wants nothing to do with the family name and states that if the family wealth ever came to him he would find ways to disperse it among the poor. To Charles' dismay his uncle knowingly questions Charles about Doctor Manette and Lucie. Soon thereafter Charles retires and the Marquis sleeps as well. Three hours later the sun rises and the people of the village begin their day. The grizzled mender of roads, however, senses some inordinate bustle at the chateau and returns to the village fountain where he learns that the body of the Marquis has been discovered with a knife driven into its chest through a note that reads: ""Drive him fast to his tomb. This from JACQUES.""
Analysis of Chapters 7-9
The scenes in the Monseignuer's court serve to highlight the ostentatious wealth of the French aristocracy and its lack of concern for the peasantry. Dickens thoroughly researched this period of French history in preparing his book and many of the details, the number of servers required to serve the chocolate for instance, are accurate. It was not rare for carriages to run over people in the street and only a fine punished nobles if their carriage inadvertently killed a man. The Marquis' obvious inhumanity and failure to appreciate the latent power of the mob serves as a reminder that a lifetime of privilege carries with it a dangerous and destructive egoism. Appropriately, the Marquis' chateau is made entirely of stone and is decorated with stone visages that, like his station in life, both shield him and complement his own intractable world-view. This section also reveals that Charles Darnay, whose real family name is Evremonde, is the nephew of this horrible man. Though he has sworn off all ties with the family it is obvious from his uncle's allusion to Doctor and Miss Manette that there is more to the family's unsavory history that will directly involve Charles though he has moved to England and begun a new life. Though the Marquis believes that he will witness this event his life is taken suddenly by an assassin, assumed to be the stranger riding under the Marquis' carriage. The reference to ""Jacques"" in the note and the exhortation to drive the Maquis ""fast to his tomb"" indicates to the reader that Gaspard, the joker of the Saint Antoine district in Paris, has murdered the Marquis to avenge the death of his son.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 7-9,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 10-14
It is one year later and Charles Darnay has established himself as a higher teacher of the French language. He works hard and prospers from his diligence. One summer day he visits Dr. Manette with the intention of asking for Lucie's hand in marriage. The doctor has become an energetic and productive man and enthusiastically greets his friend. Dr. Manette grows serious when Darnay broaches the subject of marriage but encourages him to continue. Charles assures the doctor that he has no intention of separating him from his daughter and expresses his hope that the marriage would only bind father and daughter closer. The doctor agrees with these sentiments but when Darnay begins to speak of his past, admitting that his family name is not Darnay, the Doctor grows apprehensive and begs him to stop. He asks Charles to reveal his identity only if Lucie agrees to marry him and then not until the morning of the wedding. Darnay readily agrees. That evening Lucie returns to find her father working at his old prison occupation of shoemaking. She is distraught but when she calls to him he walks with her until he falls asleep.
It is 5 o'clock the next morning and Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton are awake and still drinking following another night of work. Stryver very haughtily announces that he intends to ask for Lucie Manette's hand in marriage even though the pairing will bring him no financial gain. He accuses Carton of being a disagreeable fellow and asserts that he has been embarrassed by his friend's sullen moody behavior during their visits to the Manette's. Stryver goes on to express his belief that Miss Manette will benefit greatly from the marriage and that his proposal will be a piece of good fortune for her. Carton drinks heavily during Stryver's speech and offers no resistance to the proposal though his shrewd caustic responses belie a deeper emotional struggle than his manner suggests. Stryver finishes his speech by recommending that his friend marry a woman with money so as to provide for his otherwise dismal future.
Mr. Stryver has no doubt that his proposal to Lucie will be successful. He resolves to ask for her hand immediately in order that they may begin preparations for the wedding. On his way to the Manette's he stops at Tellson's to share the good news with Mr. Lorry. The banker receives the news coldly and, much to Mr. Stryver's dismay offers no encouragement. In fact, his first response is ""Oh dear me!"" Although Mr. Lorry agrees with Mr. Stryver's various claims to worthiness he persists in withholding his approval. In his arrogance, Stryver is unable to discern any logical reason why Lucie would refuse to marry him. He asks Mr. Lorry if he thinks that Miss Manette is a fool. Mr. Lorry bristles at the implied offense to Miss Manette and suggests that in order to avoid painful, embarrassing situations for Doctor and Miss Manette; he should go to Soho that evening instead of Mr. Stryver to confer with the Doctor on the matter. He promises to bring an answer to Mr. Stryver immediately after his interview. Though Stryver can see no reason for the intermediary he accepts Mr. Lorry's offer. After Mr. Stryver leaves Tellson's, however, he considers the situation and realizes that Mr. Lorry would not express doubts if he did not believe them to be true. By the time the banker calls at his apartment to tell him the suit would not prosper, Mr. Stryver has already reconfigured the situation in his mind so that it is Miss Manette who has tried to seduce him in order to better herself and failed in the attempt. He even asserts that he might not have proposed in the first place. Mr. Lorry is dumbfounded and finds himself bustled out before he can formulate a response.
It was true that Sydney Carton was always moody and morose when at the Manette's. Yet, many nights he would walk in their neighborhood for hours until the sun rose. Soon after Mr. Stryver tells him that he has reconsidered asking for Lucie's hand, Sydney Carton is seized by a sudden impulse and goes to the Manette house where he finds Lucie alone at her work. In very sorrowful terms he expresses to her his belief that his life will only get progressively worse and that if for a moment he could have believed that she loved him he would have known that he would only bring her misery. She implores him to believe that he can prosper and be happy and asks if without her love there is no other way that she can make him happy. He asserts that he is beyond redemption but that she has stirred something in him that he thought long since dead. Again, she asks if she can do anything for him and Carton answers that he would like her to remember that on this occasion he opened himself to her and that there was enough left of him that was worthy of pity. She sorrowfully agrees to keep his trust and he humbly thanks her. On his way out he tells her that he will never speak of their conversation again and will deny that it ever occurred should she broach the subject. She weeps at his display of emotion and he reminds her that in a couple of hours he will be so besotted as to not be worthy of such affection. Carton tells her that in the near future, when the ties of marriage and motherhood have enclosed her, to remember there is one such as himself who would give his life for her happiness. He departs.
Jerry Cruncher and his son are in their regular spot outside of Tellson's watching the constant flow of traffic moving up and down Fleet Street. They see a funeral procession approaching and Jerry notices that the crowd is jeering and calling out that the man to be buried was a spy and that his body should be tumbled out of the casket. Jerry learns that the man's name was Roger Cly and that he was an Old Bailey informant. The crowd resolves to pull the body from the coach but someone in the crowd suggest instead accompanying the coach to its graveyard destination and the mob readily agrees. Jerry Cruncher slips into the crowd and accompanies them to the burial ground. After the casket is buried the mob goes on to dissolve into random acts of vandalism and drunkenness. Jerry Cruncher calmly smokes a pipe and makes a close survey of the low gates in the graveyard where the casket has been interred. That evening, amidst continuous appeals to his wife not to pray, he announces that he will be out on one of his nocturnal fishing trips that night. When his son asks about the rust on his hands and wonders aloud whether his father will return with any fish, his father sharply silences him. At one o'clock in the morning Jerry fetches some heavy tools from a locked cabinet and, believing the rest of the family to be asleep, exits the house. Young Jerry follows him and observes that two other men join his father before they reach a graveyard. Jerry the younger is horrified to observe that his father and his friends begin unearthing a fresh grave and though he initially flees in terror he returns to watch. Once the casket is unearthed, however, he flees home and falls into a troubled sleep. The next morning he knows that something must have gone wrong with the operation because his father is very upset and accuses his wife of praying against him. On the way to Tellson's young Jerry asks his father the meaning of the profession ""Resurrection Man"" and when his father haltingly tells him that it is a person who provides cadavers to doctors young Jerry announces that he would like to grow up to be a resurrection man. Jerry is noticeably proud of his son.
Analysis of Chapters 10-14
This section serves to broaden the reader's understanding of several of the key characters and their relationships toward one another. Of Lucie's three potential suitors only Carton speaks directly to Lucie. Darnay takes the admirable course by consulting with the doctor beforehand and as this is the proper method, and the affection between him and Miss Manette is apparent, it is assumed that his suit will prosper. Mr. Stryver's proposal, on the other hand, is presumed to fail by everyone who knows of it except Stryver himself. That his pride can admit no other explanation save Lucie's own ignorance and stupidity underscores his egotistic sensibility. Two events occur which create suspense and foreshadow things to come. First, Doctor Manette is apprehensive about Darnay's past and his insistence on postponing the truth coupled with his temporary relapse leads the reader to draw a connection between the Evr�monde's and the doctor's imprisonment. Second, Sydney Carton's emotional episode with Lucie Manette reveals him to be a man of much greater sensibility and feeling than previously depicted. His avowal to give his life for her happiness introduces a defining aspect of his character and one that will figure prominently later in both their lives. The episode with Jerry Cruncher and his son reveals the reason behind Jerry Cruncher's muddy boots and rusty hands. Though his nocturnal occupation provides extra income it is apparent that he feels some doubt regarding its morality. He not only castigates his wife for praying but he is happy to learn that his son does not condemn the practice.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 10-14,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 15-16
For three days in a row there has been more than the usual number of early drinkers in the Defarge's wine shop. Monsieur Defarge has been absent for several days but Madame Defarge tends to her customers, many of whom come not to drink but to whisper conspiracies. When known spies for the government enter the conversation ceases and Madame Defarge knits steadily. At noon on the third day Monsieur Defarge enters the shop with the mender of roads from the small village where the Marquis was murdered. All the men refer to each other as ""JACQUES."" While the mender of roads takes a thin meal of stale bread and wine, various men get up and leave the shop to go to the garret apartment. Eventually Defarge and the road mender join the others. The road mender says that a man the Parisians know to be Gaspard, father of the child run over by the Marquis' carriage, was captured by the soldiers of his village. He was beaten and placed in a cage suspended above the prison and for many days the people in the town witnessed his suffering but could do nothing to help him. The villagers heard that a petition had been presented to the King to spare the man's life but they didn't know if it was true. Two of the Jacques interrupt the story and explain to the road mender that Defarge himself hazarded his own life by stepping in front of the King's carriage and was beaten for presenting the petition. The mender of roads says that the people of the village whispered that in Paris prisoners were horribly tortured before being killed and another of the Jacques affirms this fact. One morning the village awoke to find a gallows erected next to their communal fountain. That afternoon Gaspard was hung and his body left to rot with the murder weapon decorating the gallows. His story finished, the road mender is asked to wait outside while Defarge and the various Jacques confer. They all agree to include the Marquis' entire family and his chateau on their list of those registered for destruction. Defarge assures the men that the authorities will not discover his wife's method of keeping the list, sewn as code into her knitting. Before the road mender returns to his village the Defarge's take him to see a royal procession. The road mender is overcome by the gallantry and reach pageantry of the aristocracy that he cries out his enthusiasm. Later the Defarges commend his zeal and remind him that it will be useful when the time comes to destroy the aristocracy. The road mender returns to his village wiser and for the first time in his simple life, empowered.
The Defarge's return to the wine shop and Monsieur Defarge learns from a Jacques of the police that a new spy named John Barsad has started working the Saint Antoine district. As she shuts up the shop for the night Madame Defarge observes that her husband is depressed and he admits that he is sad that the revolution may not come in his lifetime. She reminds him that it could come at any moment and though it may not arrive while they live she is confident they have done much to help bring it to fruition. The next day a man Madame Defarge recognizes as the spy John Barsad comes into the shop and tries to bait her into revealing the district's sympathies for the executed Gaspard. As a signal to the others in the shop she places a flower in her hair and the shop quickly empties. As Barsad tries to bait her, Madame Defarge knits his name into the register. Monsieur Defarge joins them and the spy, knowing that Doctor Manette sheltered with the Defarge's, relates the news that Miss Manette is to marry the nephew of the murdered Marquis who is living under the name Darnay in England. Madame records this information in her register as well. After the spy leaves, Monsieur Defarge expresses his hope that destiny will keep Darnay out of France but his wife observes that fate will do what it will. That evening Monsieur Defarge admires the character of his wife as she goes throughout the street visiting the women.
Analysis of Chapters 15-16
These chapters juxtapose the horrible death of Gaspard with the increasing unrest in Paris. Significantly, the mender of roads from the village is the one to convey the news of Gaspard's death and his horror at effect upon his fellow villagers connects with the sentiments already being pursued by the society of Jacques in Saint Antoine. The manner in which the Defarge's use his zeal for the pageantry of the procession to remind him that such zeal can be turned to his own advantage encapsulates the manner in which the methodical planning of the Jacques and their agenda can be readily accepted by the rural peasants who have suffered as much under the wasteful aristocratic rule. Madame Defarge emerges from this section as a prime motivator for the revolution. She is differentiated from her husband in two ways. First, she is shown to be more patient and determined when she demonstrates to him that it is only necessary that their enemies suffer not that they do the actual persecution. Second, she does not express any sympathy for Charles Darnay whom she considers a member of the aristocracy and therefore irredeemable in her eyes.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 15-16,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 17-20
The night before Lucie Manette is to marry Charles Darnay she and her father sit under the plane tree in their yard and she reassures him that he love for Charles and all the ties that marriage will bring will not intrude upon her feelings for her father. He assures her that he knows this to be true and that her marriage will only make him happier. He speaks of the time he spent in prison, something Lucie has only heard him mention once before, and describes how he imagined what his child might be, son or daughter, and worried that they would never know him. He explains that in his furthest flights of solitary imagining he never would have believed that he could be as happy as his present life has made him. Later that night Lucie sneaks into her father's bedroom and, placing her hand on his breast, she prays that she will always be true to him.
The morning of the wedding Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross fuss over the beautiful bride while Dr. Manette and Charles Darnay confer in the adjoining room. When Mr. Lorry suggests that he should have married before he grew old, Miss Pross insists that he was born to be a bachelor. Mr. Lorry promises Lucie that he and Miss Pross will take good care of her father while she and Charles spend two weeks honeymooning in Warwickshire and will send him to Wales to join them in good health. When Darnay and the Doctor emerge from their conference Mr. Lorry notices that the Doctor is pale and seems cowed. The wedding, which is private at a small church, goes smoothly and after breakfast the newly married couple are on their way. Mr. Lorry again notices the doctor's changed demeanor and when he returns later in the evening he is alarmed to find Doctor Manette at his old occupation of making shoes. The doctor does not recognize either Mr. Lorry or Miss Pross. Mr. Lorry, for the first time in his life, takes a leave of absence from Tellson's in order to attend to his sick friend. For nine days he tries to bring the doctor to his senses by making small talk about ordinary affairs.
On the morning of the tenth day Mr. Lorry awakes in the doctor's room where he had unintentionally fallen asleep. The doctor has returned to normal but is not aware that nine days have passed since Lucie's wedding. After breakfast Mr. Lorry engages his friend in a discussion regarding a hypothetical friend who recently experienced the recurrence of an old mental debility. The doctor understands that they are in fact discussing himself but continues with the conceit. When the doctor learns that Mr. Lorry's ""friend's"" daughter is unaware of the relapse he is very thankful. The doctor admits that the relapse was foreseen by its subject and dreaded. The doctor expresses his belief that the relapse might not return. Mr. Lorry asks if perhaps if his friend works too hard and the doctor denies that this is the cause. Mr. Lorry then suggests that the tools that accompany the relapse (meaning the shoemaker's tools and bench) should be thrown away. The doctor argues that they were once so important to the subject's survival as to have become dear to him. He relents, however, that they should be disposed of in the subject's absence. Accordingly, as soon as the doctor has left for Wales to meet his daughter and son-in-law, Mr. Lorry with Miss Pross assisting utterly destroys the shoemaking implements.
Soon after Charles and Lucie return their first visitor is Sydney Carton. He pulls Charles aside and asks him if they could be friends so he might have the privilege of calling upon the couple informally about four times a year. Charles asserts that they have always been friends, which Carton dismisses, but readily accepts Charles' offer to call upon them whenever he feels the need. Later that night Charles makes comments about Carton being reckless and careless. Later, in private, Lucie begs him to show more leniency in his opinion of Carton and expresses her belief that he is capable of great things. Charles is touched by the reminder that while they are happy Carton is miserable. He promises to remember her advice.
Analysis of Chapters 17-20
The doctor's mental relapse following his private conversation with Charles Darnay sets the stage for a collision between the doctor's past and Charles' aristocratic family. Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross are revealed are shown to have softened in the years of they have spent with the Manette family. Their easy banter and shared joy in the union reflect a deeper emotional life than either had been comfortable expressing at the beginning of the story. As such, it is appropriate that they share in the destruction of the doctor's shoemaking tools - the most tangible sign of his former life and in their view the best service they can do for the family. Their sensitivity to the dynamics of the family, evidenced by the secrecy they maintain around the doctor's relapse, endears them to Dr. Manette when he has recovered his senses. This desire to protect his daughter from his relapses coupled with his tacit permission to destroy the shoemaking implements indicates that Doctor Manette is hopeful of overcoming his past and its associations with Darnay's ancestry. Sydney Carton's somewhat awkward request to be permitted to visit the family demonstrates the degree to which their happiness has become necessary for his survival. That Lucie's sympathy for him is genuine is evidenced by her defense of his character to her husband.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 16-20,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 21-24
Years pass. Lucie occasionally suffers misgivings about the future but she is a model mother and homemaker. She gives birth to a daughter, which she and Charles name Lucie. Later they have a son who dies while still a child. They see Sydney Carton about six times a year but he is never intoxicated when he visits. Little Lucie forms an emotional attachment to Carton and, without knowing why, pities him. Stryver achieves professional success with Carton's help and marries a wealthy widow with three sons. When Stryver presents these boys as pupils to Darnay they are rejected. About the time of little Lucie's sixth birthday, Mr. Lorry arrives with grave news of social unrest in France from Tellson's Paris branch. They all feel powerless against the rising tide of violence.
Far across the water in the district of Saint Antoine, centered upon the Defarge's wine shop, the revolution has begun and the Defarge's are busy arming the peasants and leading them in an assault upon the hated Bastille prison. For many hours the siege continues until the remaining soldiers surrender and the peasantry rush in with bloodthirsty vengeance. Madame Defarge, armed with pistols and a saber, leads the women and Monsieur Defarge is one of the first men to enter the breached prison. Monsieur Defarge has a soldier lead him to one-hundred-and-five north tower, the former cell of Doctor Manette. The soldier leads him though dense passageways to the long uninhabited cell where Defarge and one of the Jacques find the initials A.M. (Alexandre Manette) carved in the wall. They search the cell and Defarge claims to have found nothing in the chimney before they return to the mob. With the Defarge's in the lead, the mob propels the governor of the prison through the streets and when he falls dead from its blows Madame Defarge cuts off his head with her knife. Seven prisoners are released and the heads of seven guards are hoisted up on pikes for display.
A week later the Saint Antoine district is calm but enlivened by its newly discovered power. Madame Defarge has a lieutenant honorably named The Vengeance. Monsieur Defarge returns to the shop with the news that an aristocrat named Foulon, an enemy of the people who told them they should eat grass if they were hungry, is being brought into the city as a prisoner. At the urgings of the Defarge's the district of Saint Antoine is roused to a murderous pitch and the crowd goes to the Hall of Examination where Foulon is being questioned. Eventually the crowd seizes the aged man and hangs him from a lamppost, severs his head from his body and places it, with grass in its mouth, upon a pike for all to see. Then the mob seizes Foulon's son-in-law and treats him to a similar fate. Eventually the crowd returns to Saint Antoine to prepare what meager food is available and share in the companionship of the district.
Far away in the village the mender of roads continues at his occupation. There is a great blight upon the lands and nothing will grow in the dry heat. The soldiers of the prison are reduced in number and their officers have no faith that they will obey orders. Throughout France the aristocracy has begun to flee the country for fear of so many hungry people. All over France, low-caste men from revolutionary Paris have begun to mix with the local populations in the small villages. One day in July, the mender of roads meets a shaggy-haired man coming down the road. They greet one another as ""JACQUES"" and by dropping a pinch of gunpowder into his pipe the stranger indicates that there will be action that night. The stranger sleeps while the mender works and at sunset the stranger proceeds in the direction of the Marquis' chateau. That night the village, much to the consternation of Monsieur Gabelle (the local chief functionary) expectantly gathers near the fountain. In the grounds of the chateau the stranger meets three others who have come from the cardinal points on the compass. Soon their efforts yield a great conflagration that swallows the chateau. A rider from the chateau comes to the village seeking aid but is ignored. The rider gallops to the prison but the officers, looking doubtfully at their soldiers, tell him that the chateau must burn. The villagers light their houses with candles and surround the house of Monsieur Gabelle who resolves to throw himself from the roof if the villagers break in. In other villages the same scene is repeated and the revolution comes to the countryside.
Three years pass and the aristocracy have all been killed or hunted out of France. Many of those aristocrats who live in exile in England gather daily at Tellson's, which due to its branch offices in both countries, has become a conduit of information. One morning Charles Darnay visits Tellson's with the object of dissuading Mr. Lorry from making a scheduled trip to France in order to save what documentation can be spared from the Paris branch. Darnay expresses the wish that he was going himself because, as a Frenchmen with sympathy for the people, he might be of some use. Mr. Lorry assures his friends that the trip is absolutely necessary and tells him that he will depart that night with Jerry Cruncher as an escort. Their conversation takes place amid the hustle and bustle of the bank where various French aristocrats-in-exile are venting their complaints against the people of France. Mr. Styver is also there and much to Darnay's annoyance loudly supports the aristocrat's assertions. Darnay notices that a letter on Mr. Lorry's desk is addressed to Darnay's real name ""The Marquis St. Evr�monde"". When the other exiled aristocrats begin to disparage the missing Evr�monde, Darnay defends him and receives much ridicule from Mr. Stryver. Darnay admits that he knows Evr�monde and Mr. Lorry entrusts him to deliver the letter. Outside, Darnay opens the letter and finds that it is from Gabelle, an old loyal servant of the Marquis, who has been imprisoned and will be killed unless the emigrant (i.e. Darnay) returns to answer charges of treason against the people. Darnay considers that he has committed no crime and resolves to go to Paris. He is beguiled with the belief that by going he can do some good and perhaps help steer the revolution away from its bloody beginning. He gives Mr. Lorry a letter for Gabelle. The following night, before he departs for France, he leaves letters for Lucie and Doctor Manette explaining his reasons for going to Paris.
Analysis of Chapters 21-24
The revolution finally arrives with the storming of the Bastille. Dickens strove to be historically accurate in his depiction of the event, including such incidents as the beheading of the governor and the number of prisoners actually freed, but places his characters in the forefront of the action. Although the subject's name is changed, the incident in which Foulon is killed by the mob and his mouth stuffed with grass actually occurred during the revolution and lends credence to the story for Dickens' readers. Madame Defarge is revealed to be a woman capable of great acts of violence indicating a deep-seated need for revenge previously only gleaned through her methodical knitting. She shows great zeal in beheading the Bastille's Governor and later plays a key role in Foulon's death. When the revolution spreads to the countryside it is the men from the city who must stir the peasants to rebellion but once shown that the old ways can be destroyed they are quick to capitalize on their new sense of power as evidenced by the scene with the functionary Gabelle is persecuted and driven to his rooftop. It is typical of the plot scheme that the letter, which calls Darnay to France, should reach him through his association with Mr. Lorry. The train of events, which stemmed from the Marquis' carriage killing Gaspard's child, has resulted in Gabelle's imprisonment and Darnay's motive for returning to France. His decision to leave is motivated at least in part by pride as displayed by his obvious displeasure at Mr. Stryver's remarks regarding his Evremonde identity and his belief that he can play some part in leading the uprising against his own class.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 21-24,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 1-5
Upon arriving in France, Charles Darnay's progress to Paris is retarded by numerous inspections by each small village's group of red-capped patriots. At one such village, still a far distance from Paris, he is awakened in the middle of the night and is told that as an aristocrat he must be escorted to Paris under guard, that he must leave immediately and that he must pay for the escort. At the small town of Beauvias he is told that new decrees have seized all the property of emigres and aristocrats and that more decrees are expected soon that will condemn all such persons as himself to death. Nevertheless, Darnay and his escort reach Paris the following day where at the Barrier none other than Monsieur Defarge inspects his papers, especially the letter from Gabelle. The officer in charge consigns Darnay, or Evremonde, as he is known in France, to the prison of La Force. On the way to the prison, Defarge relates his connection to Darnay's family but refuses to help him in any way. Darnay hears a crier in the streets announcing that the royal family has been taken to prison and that all foreign ambassadors have fled the country. He then realizes that the situation in his native country is much more serious and deadly than he had previously imagined. The narrator notes that in a few days the mass executions by Guillotine would begin. Although the orders for Darnay's imprisonment call for him to be held ""in secret"" or solitary confinement he briefly mingles with some of the other prisoners and is amazed to find that the prisoners are full of manners and refinement while the guards are uncouth and uncultured. Once in his cell he is told that he may not purchase any writing utensils or paper but may purchase food. Alone he paces his cell and thinks about Doctor Manette making shoes.
The Paris branch of Tellson's is located in a wing of a large house that has been seized from its aristocrat owner. Unlike the London branch, it is lavishly furnished and separated from the street by a high wall. In its courtyard there is a grindstone that the revolutionaries used to sharpen their weapons. After a busy day of trying to reconcile utterly chaotic accounts and take inventory of what documents remain, Mr. Lorry is sitting by the fire, listening to the chaos in the streets and giving thanks that, so he believes, no one dear to him is in the city. Shortly thereafter he is surprised when Lucie and Doctor Manette appear at his door and, in a state of high emotion, inform him that Charles has been in the city several days as a prisoner. They are interrupted by the sound of a large crowd in the courtyard and Mr. Lorry, who knows that it is the sound of weapons being sharpened at the grindstone, begs them not to open the blinds. Doctor Manette explains that his past suffering as a prisoner of the Bastille has made him a hero and person whose character is beyond reproach in the new Republic. Fearing that the sight of the mob might overwhelm Lucie, however, Mr. Lorry sequesters her in another room while he and Doctor Manette look upon the grisly sight of the angry mob savagely sharpening its bloody instruments of death in the yard below. Mr. Lorry informs Doctor Manette that the mob is murdering the prisoners and begs him to use what influence he has immediately to spare Charles' life. Doctor Manette converts the mob to his cause and departs with them to La Force. Mr. Lorry goes to Lucie and finds her with Miss Pross and her daughter. Lucie has collapsed under the emotional strain and Mr. Lorry spends a sleepless night waiting for word from the Doctor.
The next day Mr. Lorry, knowing that he cannot endanger Tellson's by sheltering Lucie and her family and also aware that Charles will not be able to leave the city for some time even if he is released, engages an apartment near the bank for the family and leaves Jerry to look after them. Later in the day, Monsieur Defarge arrives with a note from the doctor to the effect that Charles is saved for the moment but will not be released. In the note the doctor asks that the messenger be permitted to see Lucie. Only after Madame Defarge and The Vengeance join them on the way to the apartment does Mr. Lorry notice Defarge's affected, mechanical manner. At the apartment Lucie is initially grateful for her husband's note and his observation that her father has ""influence"" in Paris. Madame Defarge's cold manner and relentless knitting make Lucie apprehensive. After Madame Defarge has seen little Lucie she leaves. Before she leaves Lucie begs her to help her family and Madame Defarge's impersonal reply brings despair to them all.
Four days later Doctor Manette returns and describes to Mr. Lorry the horror of the hundreds of executions. He relates how he used his influence to stay Charles' execution but could not get him released or his case brought to trial. Over time, Doctor Manette becomes well known and liked among the revolutionaries and practices his trade as the chief surgeon for three prisons including La Force. Mr. Lorry notices that whereas the Doctor's imprisonment was once a source of weakness and fear in revolutionary Paris it has become his strength and solace. He vows to save Charles. Nevertheless, fifteen months pass and Charles remains a prisoner while the Doctor builds his reputation among the bloody horrors of the revolution.
During the long months of Charles' imprisonment Lucie does her best to repress her grief and attend to her father and daughter. One day her father informs her that on some days at 3pm Charles is able to gain access to window that looks down upon a street corner near a woodsawyers shop. Every day afterward she waits from 2pm to 4pm. Over time the woodsawyer, an ardent revolutionary, engages her in conversation. Occasionally she gives him drink money but is fearful of him. The woodsawyer notices that she is constantly looking at the prison but claims, ominously, that it is none of his business. One day while she waits, Lucie is horrified to witness several hundred people including The Vengeance and the woodsawyer doing a demonic dance called the Carmagnole in the street. Later her father joins her and reassures his daughter that he can save Charles who has been summoned before the Tribunal the next day. When Doctor Manette visits Mr. Lorry that evening the narrator comments that Mr. Lorry has a visitor who chooses to remain unknown to the doctor.
Analysis of Chapters 1-5
Dickens is careful about placing Charles Darnay's return to France just prior to the bloody September massacres of that marked the beginning of the Reign of Terror and the mass executions of those condemned as enemies of the people. Darnay's dream of somehow using his influence to help direct the course of the revolution is utterly dashed by the decrees he hears en route to the city and on his way to prison. The wave of murderous, vengeful death begins with the killing of the prisoners. A notable juxtaposition of scenes occurs when Mr. Lorry and Doctor Manette look out from Tellson's, a place of safety and seclusion, to witness the bloody mob sharpening its instruments of death. At this moment, however, Doctor Manette is pressed to use his influence and he immediately succeeds in winning over the mob. This early success emboldens the doctor and whose past suffering becomes a source of strength in revolutionary Paris. While he works among the horrors of the revolution, becoming well known and well liked in the process, he grows more confident of his ability to save Charles and at no point does he express doubts that he will succeed. He is even able to arrange that Charles should be able to see Lucie occasionally during her corner-side vigils. The woodsawyers keen interest in Lucie's loitering and the appearance of the Carmagnole in the street remind the reader that the family is surrounded by danger in a city where a show of sympathy for a prisoner could lead to death.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book III Chapter 1-5,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 6-11
Charles Darnay is called to appear before the dreaded Tribunal of five judges. On the day that he appears all fifteen prisoners who go before him are sentenced to death. He notices that Madame and Monsieur Defarge are in the audience but they do not look at him. Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry are also in attendance. Following Dr. Manette's instructions, Charles carefully answers all the Tribunal's accusations and offers as witnesses to his good character the author of the letter, Gabelle, as well as Doctor Manette. The attending crowd, initially bent on taking Charles' life, are converted to his cause following Manette's testimony and Charles is declared free. The crowd is overjoyed and carries the somewhat stunned Darnay to his family's apartment where Lucie collapses in her husband's arms. Lucie and Charles offer thanks to the Doctor who admonishes his daughter not to tremble for fear because he has saved him and now he is safe.
Doctor Manette is a changed man now that he has saved his son-in-law from execution. He is confident and assured. The next afternoon before Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher leave to run errands, Miss Pross announces her fidelity to the English king and asks if they will be returning to England soon. Doctor Manette responds that it would be dangerous for Charles to try and leave so soon after his acquittal. Disappointed but resolute, Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher leave to visit many shops to make small purchases so that the household will not be perceived as ostentatious. While they are gone four men in red caps arrive to re-arrest ""The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay."" When the Doctor demands to know the reason he is told that his son-in-law has been denounced by the Defarge's and one other of the Saint Antoine district to be named the next day at the trial.
Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher enter a wine shop and while their amount is being measured Miss Pross recognizes one of the departing customers as her long-lost brother Solomon and she screams aloud in surprise. Mr. Cruncher is also very surprised and looks at the man as if he has seen a ghost. Solomon rudely beseeches his sister to keep her mouth shut unless she wants to see him killed and the trio retires to the street where he bluntly asks what she wants with him. Miss Pross is stunned by her brother's rude behavior. He admits that he knew she was in the city and has been avoiding her. He is afraid she will give away his true identity to the bloodthirsty revolutionaries with whom he serves as a prison official. Miss Pross begs only a kind word from her brother before he departs but Jerry Cruncher asks the man what other names he has used. As Cruncher struggles to remember the man's alias, Sydney Carton steps up and announces that Solomon is none other than John Barsad, spy and witness at Charles Darnay's first trial in England many years ago. Carton explains that he arrived the previous evening and presented himself to Mr. Lorry but that he chose for his presence to remain unknown until he could be useful. Much to John Barsad's consternation he further explains that Miss Pross' brother is a ""sheep"", or spy, under the goalers at the prison. Carton compels Barsad to accompany him to Tellson's bank where he relates to Mr. Lorry that Charles Darnay has been rearrested. Using the analogy of a card game, Sydney Carton proceeds to explain why it is in Barsad's best interest, lest his identity be betrayed, to be Carton's friend and help him with a special favor. Over the course of the conversation Carton alludes to Barsad's prior co-conspirator, Roger Cly who he believes is in France as well, but Barsad insists that Cly is dead and offers to produce a death certificate as proof. Upon hearing this claim Jerry Cruncher interrupts and, much to the surprise of all present, angrily states that he knows for a fact that Roger Cly's body was not in the coffin that was buried. Barsad is compelled by fear of discovery to assist Carton who, after he learns that Barsad can gain access to the prisoners (though he cannot free anyone), pours himself a third glass of brandy and then asks to speak to the spy in private.
While Carton and Barsad converse, Mr. Lorry demands that the visibly disturbed Jerry Cruncher tell him what else he's been doing for income besides acting as messenger at Tellson's. Cruncher initially answers ""Agricultooral character"" but when Mr. Lorry hints that he will lose his job Cruncher beseeches his employer to go easy on him since many doctors have performed the same function as himself but for higher wages. Seeing that this has not mollified Mr. Lorry, Cruncher begs him to let his son continue at Tellson's while he takes up the more honest profession of grave digging. He claims that the bloody sights of the revolution have caused him to reconsider his nocturnal profession and points out that he need not have volunteered the helpful information regarding Roger Cly. Mr. Lorry agrees to stay Cruncher's friend if he repents in action not just word. Soon afterward, Barsad leaves and Carton announces that he has ensured access to Darnay at least one time prior to his execution. Mr. Lorry is visibly distressed and saddened and Carton expresses feelings of tenderness for the old man that causes Mr. Lorry to re-evaluate the morose barrister. Mr. Lorry is to go visit Lucie that evening and Carton stresses the importance of keeping his presence in Paris a secret from her. Mr. Lorry affirms that he is ready to leave the city and his papers are in order. Carton reminds Mr. Lorry that though the old man is a bachelor he has the great comfort of knowing that if he were to die the next day there would be mourners at his funeral. He and Carton discuss the manner in which a man's memory returns to his childhood as he draws nearer to death and Carton admits that he has recently experienced powerful memories of his unhappy youth. Carton walks Mr. Lorry to the Manettes and then wanders the streets of Paris, retracing in part Lucie's daily walk to the prison. He stops at a chemist's shop and orders several concoctions, which the chemist cautions him against mixing improperly. As he walks that night he repeats to himself the words on his father's gravestone: ""I am the resurrection and the life."" The next morning he slips unnoticed into the courtroom where Charles is to be retried. The prosecution announces three witnesses, Monsieur and Madame Defarge and, amid great uproar, Doctor Manette himself. The doctor protests vociferously but is shouted down and told to listen to the evidence. Monsieur Defarge reads aloud a manuscript he recovered from the doctor's old cell the day that the Bastille fell.
The manuscript is in the doctor's hand was written after he had been a prisoner for ten years. It relates the incidents of his capture and detainment. One night in 1757 he was walking home from a case, a young surgeon with a growing reputation, when a carriage containing two twin gentlemen stopped him and under threats of violence took him to a house where a woman lay restrained on a bed. She was hysterical and kept repeating the phrase ""My husband, my father, and my brother!"" She then would count from one to twelve and say ""Hush"" before repeating the lines again. The two brothers seemed inconvenienced by the woman's condition and after the doctor gave her a sedative, which does not cease her litany, the brothers reluctantly admitted that there was another patient. In a back room filled with hay, the doctor found a young man dying of a saber wound. The brothers showed no pity for this boy whom they referred to as a ""brute."" As he died, the boy told the doctor how his sister, who lies in the other room, married a poor man like herself and when he would not consent to allowing one of the brothers to have his way with her the nobleman harnessed her husband to a cart and drove him like an animal until he died one day at noon, sobbing once for each stroke of the bell. The noble took the girl and when the boy told his father the old man's heart burst from grief and he died. The young man then came to kill the nobleman and free his sister but was outmatched and suffered the mortal wound that he soon died from. The noble who took the girl was none other than the Marquis Evr�monde. The girl lingered a week in great pain and the brothers only concern during this time was that the whole situation seemed ridiculous and potentially degrading to their family. When she finally died the nobles offered the doctor money and insisted on his discretion. He refused, however, to take their gold. The next morning the doctor found the gold on his front doorstep and wrote a letter to his Minister describing the whole situation. The next day, before sending the letter, he was visited by the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde who had heard of the girl's mistreatment and was greatly distressed. She expressed her hope that the girl's younger sister would have a good life. The Doctor saw that the woman had a young son (who is Charles) with her and she shared her belief that in the future her son would have to pay for the wickedness of his father and uncle. The doctor delivered the letter that very day. That night he was summoned by a carriage for an urgent case but soon thereafter the carriage stopped and the brothers stepped from the roadside shadows, burnt the letter in front of the doctor and interred him in the prison where he has remained ever since without communication to the outside world. The Doctor's manuscript ends with a curse upon the Evremonde's and all their descendents. After the reading the crowd and the jury are unanimous in their condemnation of the Evremondes and sentence Charles to be executed the following day.
Lucie and Charles are allowed to briefly embrace. Charles comforts the distraught doctor with the thought that he has done everything in his power but that none can stop fate. Only after hearing the manuscript does the family understand the true nature of the doctor's years of torment. The doomed man is carried back to his cell and Lucie collapses at her father's feet. The doctor utters a great cry of anguish. Sydney Carton appears and carries the unconscious Lucie to a carriage and then into the Manette's apartment where he gently lays her on a couch. Little Lucie hugs Carton and begs him to do something to help them. Carton kisses the still insensible Lucie on the cheek and only little Lucie hears him whisper ""A life you love."" Carton immediately becomes business-like and brings the distraught doctor to his senses. Though he admits to Mr. Lorry that he has no hope of success, Carton charges the doctor with the task of working to spare Charles' life and then to report the result at Mr. Lorry's quarters that evening at 9 o'clock.
Analysis of Chapters 6-11
A great deal happens in this section to move the plot forward and reveal some the stories lingering mysteries. Like Doctor Manette, who is able to use his influence to free his son-in-law, Sydney Carton becomes a changed man in revolutionary Paris. Both men seem at their best when those they love are threatened. Like his friend Stryver, Carton is suddenly energetic and cunning as when he convinces Barsad to help him and, as in his conversation with Mr. Lorry, surprisingly open and sympathetic. His maneuverings and calculated steps (as when he visits the chemist) belie a greater scheme. The doctor's letter reveals, for the first time, the circumstances surrounding his imprisonment and explain the reason for his request that Darnay keep his true identity and secret and the relapse that followed that confession. The audience is reminded of the aristocrat's cruelty during the years leading up to the revolution by the letter. Ironically, it's author's term of imprisonment, recently made a source of strength, becomes the means for his son-in-law's sentence of death. In this way Fate, as personified by Madame Defarge, achieves mastery over the Evremonde clan and the dying boy's request is honored by the doctor himself.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book III Chapter 6-11,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

Chapter 12-15
With several hours to spare, Carton goes to the Defarge's wine shop with the purpose of making his face known to the revolutionaries. At the shop, he pretends to be unfamiliar with the French language and Madame Defarge closely examines his appearance. He overhears the Defarge's commenting on his likeness to Darnay and also overhears Monsieur Defarge meekly suggest to his wife that Lucie and her daughter's life should be spared in order to please the doctor who has suffered much in the cause of the revolution. Madame Defarge and her compatriots scoff at the idea and Madame reminds her husband that she is the younger daughter of the girl who died so horribly in the doctor's manuscript. Madame Defarge is without mercy and has sworn to wipe out the Evremonde race in its entirety. Carton returns to Mr. Lorry's apartment and waits for the doctor. When Doctor Manette returns soon after midnight it is not only apparent that Charles is doomed but that the Doctor's senses have become deranged. The doctor pitifully begs for his shoemaking tools. Before Mr. Lorry leaves to take the doctor to Lucie, Carton demands that the banker follow his instructions exactly. Mr. Lorry is to hold on to Carton's letters of transit and is to hold the similar papers of the doctor, Lucie and her daughter. He tells Mr. Lorry that Lucie and little Lucie are in grave danger and it is imperative that the family flees the city the next day before the transit papers can be rescinded. Mr. Lorry is to be ready to leave with the family at exactly 2pm the next day but he is not to depart until Carton has rejoined them after visiting Charles in his cell. That night Carton walks outside of Lucie's apartment for the last time.
That same night in prison Charles Darnay composes his mind and resolves himself to accept the death that certainly awaits him. He writes letters to Lucie, Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry but never once thinks of Carton. Eventually he falls into an uneasy sleep and dreams of the happiness of their Soho home. He awakes and knows instantly that on that day, a day marked for 52 executions, he will die. As a church bell tolls the hours he counts each one that he will never see again until it tolls one o'clock and he hears footsteps approaching his cell. Sydney Carton enters and with quick dialogue and forceful appeals he convinces Darnay to change clothing with him one article at a time. Darnay believes that Carton wants to break him out of jail and knowing this to be impossible begs him not to perish in the attempt. Carton denies this plan and orders Darnay to begin writing as he dictates. As Darnay writes Carton prepares a chemical mixture and then forcibly applies it to Darnay, rendering the latter unconscious. Although Barsad fears that Carton will betray himself before the Guillotine falls, and endanger the spy as well, he yields to Carton's assurances and takes the still comatose Darnay out in his place. At two o'clock Carton is taken to a room where the other fifty-two victims wait. A young girl, a seamstress who knew Darnay from his prior imprisonment, approaches Carton, and after some dialogue in which she expresses her fears of death she realizes it is a different man. He motions for her to keep his secret and she implores him ""O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"" He promises to do so until the last. The narrator looks forward in time and observes that the carriage bearing the still unconscious Darnay, his family and Mr. Lorry proceeds safely from the city and slowly but surely makes its way to the coast.
At the same time that Sydney Carton is awaiting execution in Darnay's place, Madame Defarge, the Vengeance and Jacques Three (the most bloodthirsty of the Jacques) hold a meeting in the woodsawyer's shed. Madame Defarge expresses her sadness that her husband lacks the resolve to see the Evremonde clan completely exterminated and she asserts that she must ensure that Evremonde's wife and daughter do not escape the Guillotine. Furthermore, Madame Defarge asserts that the doctor must also fall before the blade. To her compatriot's joy, Madame Defarge announces that she will go to the doctor's apartment and confront Lucie. She agrees to meet the others at the execution site before the blade falls. She carries with her a loaded pistol and a dagger. At the apartment Miss Pross and Jerry Cruncher are waiting to leave in a lighter carriage that will overtake and join the one that recently departed containing the family. They know that Carton has traded places with Darnay and that every moment counts. Jerry is so emotional that he proclaims to Miss Pross that he will never do ""It"" any more, (by which he means unearthing dead bodies) and that he will never again forbid Mrs. Cruncher from ""flopping."" Miss Pross understands neither of these allusions but passionately signifies that she has heard him. Miss Pross expresses her belief that it would be best if the second carriage did not depart from the apartment and raise suspicions. She sends Jerry to intercept their carriage and await her at a certain Cathedral door familiar to them both. After Jerry departs, Miss Pross is washing her face when she is surprised to see that Madame Defarge has entered the apartment. Madame Defarge demands to know the family's whereabouts. Miss Pross does not understand French and Madame Defarge speaks no English but the two women immediately understand that they are at cross-purposes. Madame Defarge inspects all the rooms but the one that Miss Pross blocks and the two women struggle and the pistol explodes and kills Madame Defarge. Miss Pross composes herself and then locks the apartment and flees. On her way to meet Jerry she drops the key in the river. When she meets Jerry he realizes that the poor woman has become deaf though he cannot understand why.
The tumbrels carrying those to be executed roll through the Paris streets. The doomed display varying countenances, from resolved to insane. John Barsad sees Sydney Carton holding the hand of a young girl and prays that he will not betray him. The Vengeance asks her friends in vain if they have seen Madame Defarge. As the Guillotine begins its work upon the fifty-two condemned to die, Sydney Carton and the seamstress hold hands and express their belief that God has sent them each other at this moment. They kiss each other's lips before they are parted. She is executed before him. Sydney Carton looks peaceful and sublime as he is led to the blade. Before he dies his thoughts are of the family that will live long and peacefully in England because of his sacrifice. He imagines that a son is born to them that is named for him and, as the blade falls, he says to himself, ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.""
Analysis of Chapters 12-15
These chapters bring to the story to a close the story at the cost of two lives. Sydney Carton is able to fulfill his promise to give his life for Lucie's happiness by trading places with Darnay. Good, as personified by Miss Pross, triumphs over evil, personified by Madame Defarge when the latter dies by her own gun. Some critics have asserted that Carton's sacrifice is meant to be interpreted as a Christ-like act but others have insisted that because he dies for Lucie's happiness and not merely to save another his death is borne of selfish desires. In either case, Carton is depicted as having found true happiness in the moments before his death when he is able to bring comfort to the seamstress and assures her that like his own impending death hers will not be without purpose.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book III Chapter 12-15,"21    A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens [A st...

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: A Man of Ideas","Summary
	Joe Welling, an agent for the Standard Oil company, lives in Winesburg with his mother. He has a tendency to get big ideas about things in his head and then he tells people about them enthusiastically. He falls in love with Sarah King, a young woman with a dangerous brother and father. However, when they come to threaten him, Joe starts telling them about how all the fruits and vegetables in the world could be re-engineered using grasses if all the usual foods people eat were wiped out. They get swept along by the torrent of his words, like everyone else always is, and forget all about threatening him.
	Analysis
	This story demonstrates that all the grotesques do not have to be sad or frightening. Joe is rather amusing, perhaps even endearing. Nonetheless, he is a grotesque, because he has an exaggerated interest in certain ideas, a tendency that gives him tunnel vision and limits him.

Belle is in love with the bartender Ed Handby, even though they have only spent one evening in each other's company. Belle walks in the evenings with George as an outlet for her passion for the other man. She even allows George to kiss her.
	One night in January, George goes out for a walk and has an epiphany. He realizes that all people are connected through laws and a supreme order. He himself, he believes, must become more a part of that great connection. He finds himself moved by powerful words that he utters: ""death,. night, the sea, fear, loveliness"" (185). He goes to find Belle to tell her about his thoughts, but she just wants to make Ed jealous. When they go to a secluded spot to embrace, Ed shows up and tosses George aside. He does not want to beat George up; he just wants him out of the way. He does this three times, as George tries to charge the older man again and again.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Death","Summary
	Elizabeth Willard often visited Doctor Reefy in her middle age. Together, they would discuss their lives and people in town. They became friends and almost became lovers. She told him about her life and when she spoke, she seemed like a younger woman, not the old, worn out woman she had become. When she tried to communicate how she had longed for love, he embraced her. Just then, they were interrupted by footsteps and she ran out of Doctor Reefy's office. Elizabeth explained to her friend that she had had several lovers before marrying Tom Willard, and she had married him because he was available when she was ready to be married. Her father tried to convince her not to marry Tom, but to take $800 he had saved and flee. When she decided to marry Tom anyway, he gave her the money and encouraged her never to tell Tom about it. Very quickly, her marriage was a disappointment. She hid the money behind her wall and left it there for many years. She died before she could tell her son George, who is eighteen years old, about the money. After his mother's death, George decided he would leave Winesburg and get a job on a city newspaper somewhere. As he sat in the room with his mother's corpse, he also imagined himself kissing Helen White, but then he felt ashamed of his thoughts and began to cry. He left the room sobbing and full of grief.
	Analysis
	In this text, people are caged by their lives and their beliefs. Death and passion both represent a type of escape or release from the unhappiness of everyday life. Elizabeth held onto the money, hoping for ""the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms"" (236). The passions of sexual desire or of death are both promises of release from the strictures that keep people from connecting with one another. 
	Caught up in the release that comes with passion of any kind, three men call Elizabeth ""You dear! You lovely dear!"" (231), but they cannot provide her with a permanent release because they do not fully understand her and only express this appreciation in moments of passion. Once the passion is over, the connection between the two people fades and the people are left with the cages of everyday life.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Departure","Summary
	George Willard leaves Winesburg to go make his way in the big city. Several people see him off at the station, but Helen White is too late to wish him farewell. He thinks of mundane things as he waits for the train to pull out of the station. The conductor, who has seen many young men starting off on this journey, says nothing to George about what an important day this is.
	Analysis
	This is a rather hopeful ending for a text that has not been terribly optimistic. George is off to make his fortune in the world, but he can only do so alone, by saying goodbye to all his human connections. He is impatient with the people there to see him off, because this is his adventure, not theirs. In the final moment, he is a metaphor for everyone's lives; we are all alone on the train of existence, and any connection we make with others is destined to be fleeting.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Drink","Summary
	Tom Foster moved to Winesburg with his grandmother as a teenager. She cleans Banker White's house. Tom used to be the stable boy at the Whites' house, but because he is rather dreamy and irresponsible, he lost that position. Now, he does odd jobs and is quite happy. His grandmother comes regularly to clean his rented rooms, and he has a rather oddly disciplined approach to life experiences. He wants to do things, but he chooses specific experiences and then goes out and intentionally lives them. For example, having fallen in love with Helen White, he limits what he allows himself to think about her. One night, he decides he ought to try drinking to see what it feels like. He buys a bottle of whiskey and walks about a mile north of town, where he sits on a bank of grass and gets drunk. In his drunkenness, he goes and talks to George Willard about Helen. George is upset at first, but then they cement a bond between them. Tom decides that, now that he has been drunk, he will not need to try it again.
	Analysis
	Just as those who are overly severe or overly excited are grotesques, Tom is a grotesque because he is overly dreamy and sensitive. None of the characters in this text have a balance of characteristics; instead, they are all defined by one exaggerated belief or characteristic. Tom may be pleasant to be around, but his overly sensitive nature is no more practical in the real world than Ed Handby's violence or Seth Richmond's silence.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Godliness I - VI","Godliness I
	This is the first in a four-part story. Jesse Bentley was born sensitive in a family of rough farmers. He went off to study for the ministry and married an equally delicate woman. When all his four older brothers died in the Civil War, he came home to run the farm. Although he was sensitive, there was a strength that ran through him and made him survive a rougher life. He made a success of running the farm, even though no one expected him to be able to do so. Because he was intellectual in an age that did not lend itself to intellectual pursuits, he channeled that energy into a fervent belief in God. In doing so, he became something of a tyrant, feared by his employees. He believed that he had been specially chosen by God, and that all the people in the area were Philistines. He also believed that he needed a son to smite them. His wife died in childbirth.
	Godliness II
	Jesse did not have a son. His daughter, Louise, grew up to be a shrill and unhappy woman. She married a banker, John Hardy, and went to live in town. She has a son, David, who is timid and frightened much of the time because his mother is so erratic. Once, returning from his grandfather's farm, he runs away from home. When he returns, he is pleasantly surprised to find his mother is tender for the evening.
	David goes to live with his grandfather. He is happy on the farm, and everyone dotes on him. Once, his grandfather becomes possessed of the spirit of God while out in the wilderness with David, but this just terrifies the young boy. Other than this frightening event, however, the farm feels comfortable to him. One of his great-aunts mothers him, and he gets love he never felt at home.
	Godliness III: Surrender
	Louise grew up in a loveless household, as her father had always wanted a boy and her mother had died. As a teenager, she went to live in town to attend school. She lived in the Hardy household. The two Hardy girls hated her because she was such a good student, which was awful for her because all she wanted was love. When she reached out to their brother, John, he misunderstood and thought she wanted to become his lover. She mistakenly thought she was pregnant, and they ended up married. Because John could never understand the emptiness and need for love that drove her to him, Louise turned into a bitter woman. She neglects her son, David.
	Godliness IV: Terror
	The last part of the story returns to the story of Jesse, who meets with great financial success on his farming ventures. He decides to take his fifteen-year-old grandson, David, out into the woods to help him sacrifice a lamb. But he does not tell David what his plan is, and David becomes terrified when his grandfather approaches him and the lamb with a large knife. David runs away. When Jesse pursues him, David hits him with a stone from a slingshot. Thinking he has killed his grandfather, he flees Winesburg for good. Jesse's ambition is chastened by the loss of his beloved grandson.
	Analysis
	In the Bible, David slays Goliath the giant with a slingshot. That image is reproduced here. Jesse believes he is a man with a special connection to God, but he is actually a tyrant who needs to be slain. He believes so strongly in one truth, that he is a man chosen by God and surrounded by Philistines, that he has become warped into a grotesque. His single-minded pursuit of godliness through hard work killed his wife and turned his daughter into a miserable woman. Because he believes his grandson is part of his godliness, he makes David's life wonderful. Eventually, however, his belief goes too far and he destroys even that relationship. The truth he has embraced has destroyed every chance he had for human connectedness.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Hands","Summary
	Wing Biddlebaum, a forty-year-old man, lives on the outskirts of Winesburg and has little involvement in the community in which he has lived for twenty years. Wing is the kind of man who talks a lot with his hands. He has ""slender expressive fingers, forever active,"" and his natural tendency is to gesticulate a lot as he speaks. His story is ""a story of hands."" When he was younger, he was a gifted schoolteacher in Pennsylvania, much loved by the boys at his school. Wing's name was then Adolph Myers. However, a disturbed, half-witted boy said that Myers molested him. Since he did have a tendency to touch students in an affectionate way, people believed this boy. A man from the town named Henry Bradford came to the school and beat Myers up. Then in the night, a dozen men came to Myers's door with a rope in their hands, intending to lynch him, but he managed to escape. He moved to Winesburg and made up a new name. Now, he is afraid of letting his hands do whatever they like, so he tries to keep them contained. His only friend is the young reporter, George Willard, who sometimes comes to talk to him.
	Analysis
	Wing is a grotesque because he has constrained his hands, instruments of affection and gentleness, with the truth that a man should not lay hands on another. He has been warped by his efforts to keep himself confined within that truth.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Loneliness","Summary
	Enoch Robinson is a childish man who seems crazy. He grew up on a farm near Winesburg, and he used to want to be an artist. When he was twenty-one he went to live in New York City, where he remained for fifteen years. There, he made friends who were artists, and they came to visit him in his little rented room. They talked of the composition of his pictures, but he felt they did not understand the art. Then, he stopped letting them come visit and instead invented people to keep him company in his room, people he could better control. Eventually, he married an art student, but that, too did not work out because of his egotism. He wanted people who exactly suited his needs, rather than real people, so he left his wife and two children, returned to his room, and continued imagining people. Finally, a young woman started visiting him again, and he tried to make her understand about his people, but she realized he was crazy and ran away. He ran after her and tried to explain, but he ended up swearing at her, instead. When she left, she took all the life and imagined people out of his room. He returned to Winesburg to live out his life alone and defeated.
	Analysis
	The big city, with all its promise, could not give Enoch Robinson what he wanted. It is a lonely place, where he fails to establish connections with people. Instead, he populates his own village within the city. This does not make him an artist; it makes him immature because he cannot interact with other people. While people go away to the city to find something bigger or better than they can get in Winesburg, they are left with shattered dreams when they fail to make a connection with others.

	Elizabeth Willard owns the Winesburg hotel, which she inherited from her parents. Her husband, Tom, runs the shabby, unnprofitable hotel and behaves as though he is a very important man. He has a dream that one day he will become a Congressman or even governor. Elizabeth, on the other hand, has faded away and does not like to be seen by people. She feels defeated by life. However, she believes she has a special relationship with her son George, who sometimes comes to sit in her room with her when she is sick. But, they are just awkward with each other. One time, she hears her husband admonishing her son to be bold, and she wants desperately to communicate with George that he should not be too slick but should instead harbor dreams. Unfortunately, she is unable to communicate this to George.

	Elizabeth has big dreams that her son, George, will live the dreams she did not live. She wants him to be able to grope and find a way of expressing himself truly, rather than living a life of surface and convention. However, she is unable to express this to George because their awkwardness intervenes. Instead, she lives caged in her own unfulfilled dreams.

	Deprived of his attempt to connect with another person, the doctor spends his life creating truths that are then transformed into hard little balls. Truths are not magnificent, high-flown ideas once they are written down, because they then become mere scraps of paper. Truth is only beautiful when lived, which is what the doctor did with his wife. Without the human connection, they are meaningless.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Queer","Summary
	Elmer Cowley is the son of Ebenezer Cowley, a farmer who sold his farm a year ago and became a storekeeper. Ebenezer is not much of a merchant, as he just buys up a jumble of things that cannot really be sold. One time, Elmer threatens a merchant who tries to sell them an item they will never be able to sell again. He is bitter that his family is so odd and he thinks that everyone in the town laughs at them because of it. He takes a walk and tries to talk to a simple-minded man who remained on the Cowley farm, but he is unable to communicate his frustration. When he sees George Willard happen to look at him, Elmer flies into a rage, thinking the reporter is considering how odd the Cowleys are. Yet, when he confronts George, he cannot find words to tell him how he feels and just sputters with anger. He steals $20 from his father to take the local train to the city, where he plans to join the anonymous rush of people. He wakes up George and tells him to come down to the station, intending to tell the young man that he is not strange. Again, words fail him, and he gives George the $20 to return to his father and then beats up George before jumping on the train.
	Analysis
	Elmer believes that ""George Willard. belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town.. Did he not represent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness?"" (195). George is again thought to represent the town because he is the reporter, collecting the stories of everyone in town. For Elmer, making himself understood to George would vindicate him in the eyes of the town. He wants to be considered normal, to blend into a crowd, which is why he is going to the big city, where he expects to disappear into anonymity. However, even in the big city, there is loneliness. Elmer is lonely in a small town because he stands out, but Enoch was lonely in a big city where he blended in.
	The characters hope that moving from one place to another will give them a chance to make a meaningful connection with another person. This is why trains are so prominent in this book. Travel is a modern condition, in which people can leave small towns or cities easily. However, they cannot flee the essential human condition of loneliness, which just takes different forms in different settings.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Respectability, The Thinker & Tandy","Respectability
	Wash Williams is a huge, dirty, misshapen man who looks something like an ugly monkey. He has no friends and he hates women. Only George Willard knows his story. Wash had a beautiful wife who he loved in his own lovely youth, when he worked in the telegraph office in Columbus, Ohio. Then, he found out she had lovers and sent her back to her mother's house. When her mother asked Wash to come see his wife in Dayton, he would have taken her back if her mother had not devised a plan that horrified him and destroyed his belief in women. She sent Wash's wife into the room naked, hoping that would make him take her back. Wash was shocked and attacked his wife's mother with a chair. Now he despises all women and pities all men. This event also made the telegraph operator much less effective in his job, and he was transferred to Winesburg.
	The Thinker
	Seth Richmond is a young man with a rather forbidding kind of demeanor. He is so quiet that people think he is a deep thinker and are intimidated by him. Actually, he is just a manipulative person who does not have much to say. Even his mother is frightened by him. Once, he ran away with some other youths to the county fair and spent a few days stealing farmers' lunches and having fun. Upon his return, he manipulated his mother so she did not admonish him. When George Willard decides to be in love with Helen White, he asks Seth to speak to her on his behalf, since Seth knows Helen better than he does. Seth is irritated by this request and leaves abruptly. He thinks George is a fool. Seth wanders the streets for a while, feeling depressed because he does not feel part of the life of his own town. Eventually, he reaches the Whites' house. Helen answers the door and he invites her for a walk. He tells her that he is going away to Columbus and talks about his plans to get into the university there. He says nothing about George. Helen is impressed by Seth's determination. There is affection between them but neither knows how to express it. After they part, Seth thinks that Helen will end up with someone like George rather than with him.
	Tandy
	This brief story tells of how a girl named Tandy acquired her name. When Tandy was a little girl, her family did not pay much attention to her. One day, a drunken stranger told her that her name should be Tandy and that she could then be all that men want from a woman. After that, the little girl insisted on being called Tandy. The drunken man left Winesburg with nothing to show for his attempts to get sober.
	Analysis
	All three of these stories focus on the difficulty of relations between men and women. Men and women simply cannot communicate with one another. Wash adored his wife, but they had secrets and the relationship clearly was not based on open communication. His mother-in-law misunderstood and thought that the relationship was simply sexual, and so she disgusted him. A relationship that he hoped would be a sustaining and fulfilling one turned out to be just a base, physical relationship, and so he is disgusted by all relationships. So, too, does Seth Richmond have communication problems. Everyone assumes that he is deep because of his silence, but ""no great underlying purpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had no definite plan for his life"" (127). He is simply blustering, and so the moment of connection with Helen White is empty of honest communication. His mother's fear of him is also based on her misunderstanding his silence.
	Tandy's story should be a moving one, because a stranger has given her a strong identity. Actually, his strong desire for women to fulfill his needs has led him to place his own desires upon her, whether she is really that person or not. Tandy, he explains, is a quality: ""something men need from women and that they do not get"" (141). Of course, she is just a little child, and he is projecting his needs upon her. This creates a great deal of stress for the child, who now feels she needs to live up to being Tandy.
	These stories also reflect the city/small town divide. Wash had lived in the city with his young wife, and that is where everything went wrong. He has been sent to this small town because he is not fit to be a big city telegraph operator. Seth claims he is going to leave the town and go to the city. George Willard, he thinks ""belongs to this town"" but he himself does not because he is too silent (131). The town is provincial, where people know each other, George gathers up their stories, and people chat with each other. The town also has limited opportunity, which is why Seth claims to be leaving and why Wash was sent there. Young men who want to get ahead, like Ned Currie, go to the city, but then they lose their connection with people that they have in the town. Perhaps this is why Seth is so ambivalent about going away from the town. What he really wants is to be someone in the small town who is important enough to be leaving for the city.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Sophistication","Summary
	George Willard is thinking of Helen White on the day of the county fair, and she is thinking of George, even though she is stuck with a college instructor of hers who has come to town for the day. In the evening, her mother insinuates that this instructor would be a good match for Helen and keeps the two talking on the porch. Helen leaves the house and runs into George on his way to visit her. They go off together to the fairgrounds and spend some time together. They embrace a little and talk a little. Then, they play around like two small animals. After they goof around, they feel satisfied and ready to be adults.
	Analysis
	This is one of the few moments in the text where two people connect in an authentic way. The connection, like all others, is fleeting, because people are meant to spend their adult lives caught up in the truths they construct around themselves. But, for a moment, these two people are connected. It is a lovely moment, not meant to last but appreciated because they both need it at that point in their lives. Connection, then, is not so much about permanent relationships, such as marriage or parenthood, but about getting the right moment of interaction at the right time.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: The Book of the Grotesque","Summary
	An old writer has a bed that his carpenter raised up so the writer can see out the window. Unfortunately, it is now difficult for him to get in and out of the bed. From this bed, he dreams ""a dream that was not a dream"" (5) in which all the people has had ever known pass before his eyes. These figures are grotesques. From this parade of figures, he creates the stories in this book.
	Analysis
	It is important to note the definition of ""grotesques"" that he provides in this early section. Men create ""truths"" about the world: ""There was the truth of virginity and the truth of passion, the truth of wealth and of poverty, of thrift and of profligacy, of carelessness and abandon."" These truths are beautiful in themselves, but when a person takes them for himself, they become limited and limiting. A truth is beautiful because there are other truths that are its opposite, but when it is instead a rigid principle to which a person adheres, it can deform the person who keeps trying to fit into it. ""It was his notion that the moment one of the people took one of the truths to himself, called it his truth, and tried to live his life by it, he became a grotesque and the truth he embraced became a falsehood"" (6). Winesburg, Ohio, is about people who have treated truths as guiding principles of life instead of beautiful, fluid possibilities and are hence deformed by their truths.

	Doctor Parcival is one of the town's three doctors, but he has very few patients. Nonetheless, he is financially comfortable. He likes to visit George Willard at the offices of the Winesburg Eagle to tell the young man about his ideas. He tells stories about his past life, but many times they are contradictory, so George does not know what to believe. He also tries to instruct George to distrust and dislike all other people. When he refuses to come attend to a dead girl, Doctor Parcival thinks the people will lynch him. He tells George that, if he is killed, George should write his book for him: ""The idea is very simple, so simple that if you are not careful you will forget it. It is this-that everyone in the world is Christ and they are all crucified"" (42).
	Nobody Knows
	George Willard meets Louise Trunnion at her urging and the two of them have a liaison in the night. At first, she plays coy and asks how he knows she even wants to go with him, which annoys George, as she sent a note inviting him. The note said, ""I'm yours if you want me."" George is not particularly interested in Louise, but he takes the opportunity that presents itself to him. He walks away from their encounter in a field reassuring himself that no one will know about their sexual contact and so she will not be able to accuse him of anything.
	Analysis
	All of the people in this book are stuck on some idea or another that limits their ability to function within the world. Doctor Parcival's idea is that cruelty makes some people superior to others and that everyone is persecuted. Like the others in the book, he feels the need to share his thoughts with George. People like to unburden themselves to George because he is a good listener, which is probably why he is a good reporter.
	The lonely characters in this book find that George is a person they can connect to in one way or another. Louise, too, turns to George for some kind of human connection, albeit a physical one. All people are lonely, isolated by their ""truths,"" and yet they keep hoping to connect to one another. George, who is still young and has not become a grotesque, provides that opportunity.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: The Strength of God & The Teacher","The Strength of God
	Reverend Curtis Hartman, the minister of Winesburg's Presbyterian Church, regularly prays to be more fervent and more religious. One night, he looks out the window of his study in the bell tower of the church and sees in a room in a neighboring house the bare shoulders of a woman reading a book and smoking. He has had limited experience with women, and he is both shocked and attracted. He then enters into a many month period of struggle with his own desire to watch this woman, whose name is Kate Swift, read and smoke. Sometimes, he resists; sometimes, he cannot help peeking. Finally, he gives in to temptation and sits by the window, waiting for her to arrive. He breaks the glass of his window so he can see her and sits by the window in a storm. When she finally does arrive, she is weeping and then prays naked. Hartman stumbles out of the church and into the street. He feels he has been delivered from his temptation and that Kate Swift is an agent of God. He informs George Willard that he has been delivered by the body of a woman.
	The Teacher
	Much of this story takes place on the same night that the Reverend Hartman sees Kate Swift naked and praying. Kate lives with her mother, Aunt Elizabeth, in Winesburg. She has traveled and lived in cities, but then she returned to be the schoolteacher. She seems stern and forbidding, except when her passion for life overtakes her and she becomes a vibrant teacher. She is actually quite passionate. George Willard was her student, and she thought she recognized something of a genius in him. She has spoken with him several times in hopes of communicating to him all her dreams for him to become a true writer. On this stormy night, her passion for imparting this knowledge gets confused with sexual passion, and they embrace. She runs out, frustrated that he will not understand her. Shortly thereafter, Reverend Hartman, not knowing what has transpired between Kate and George that evening, comes into George's office and tells him that Kate Swift is an instrument of God.
	Analysis
	Kate Swift is incredibly passionate. But, there is little outlet for a fervent, intelligent woman in a small town in the early twentieth century. She cannot become the writers about whom she teaches, so she tries to impart her passion for life, beauty, and truth to George Willard. But, like all communication in this text, it gets garbled by the human facts of loneliness and desire. She is so overtaken by her desire to be a part of art that she is a grotesque -- caught in her loneliness.
	The men in these two stories misunderstand her. They, too, want something. The minister wants God to be within him, and George is a young man with sexual passions. They place their desires on her and use her for them, turning her into a receptacle for their own needs. This is much like the drunken man who makes Tandy a receptacle for his own desires.

As he walks home, Ray has a pleasant memory of evenings spent with his children, and he realizes that whatever he had planned to tell Hal would have been a lie.
	Analysis
	After telling the interesting tale of how Hal's father, Windpeter, died, Anderson writes: ""But this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet of his son Hal"" but ""It will. be necessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you will get into the spirit of it"" (204). This is one of several instances in which he tells a bit of a side story and then says that he is not telling that person's story. Anderson is drawing attention to the storyteller. This is a collection of stories about a collection of people, but there are many other stories out there that could be told. These stories may illustrate a particular set of circumstances, but other stories will illustrate other ideas or circumstances. Unlike many novels that pretend to be complete contained worlds, Anderson is drawing the reader's attention to the fact that any story could be a different story if that were what the storyteller chose to focus upon.

Middlemarch: Novel Summary,"Prelude
Summary
	This is a charming vignette of Saint Theresa of Avila as a little girl, holding her brother by the hand, going out into the country side looking for martyrdom, illustrating the “passionate, ideal nature [that demands] an epic life.” Such a girl who has a “rapturous consciousness of life beyond self” could hardly be content with a normal woman’s life. She is the type of many such women today who yearn for an expanded life but are not helped by the “tangled circumstance” of society. This tragic sort of woman in the modern world has no channel for her life force, but only a “vague ideal and the common yearning of womanhood.” She is a swan among ducks and finds no fellowship.
	Analysis
	Eliot’s famous Prelude to Middlemarch could be the outcry of the Victorian woman, or women of any age, who have no outlet for their talents or direction for their spiritual lives. They are like the child Theresa, who nevertheless, even in a man’s world, grew up to reform a religious order. Eliot sets up an epic question: what sort of heroism is possible in the modern world, especially for women? Her main character, Dorothea Brooke, is such a modern St. Theresa.
Chapters 1-5 (The Brooke Sisters)
Summary
	Dorothea Brooke and her younger sister, Celia, are two young ladies of marriageable age who have recently come to live with their bachelor uncle and guardian, Mr. Brooke, at Tipton Grange. Though Dorothea is the striking and beautiful older sister, the rural opinion favors the pretty Celia as the one who is easier to understand. While Celia knows life through common sense, Dorothea is always out of place with her refined religious perceptions and longings. Dorothea is severe and Puritanical compared to Celia, who has normal coquettish desires for dress, jewelry, and conquests.
	Dorothea does not want a husband like the neighbor, Sir James Chettham, an amiable but ordinary squire, who is in love with her. She thinks him boring, though in her passion for good works, she persuades him to build decent cottages for his tenants and gives him her designs. He goes along with her plans as he prepares to propose to her. No one reckons on Dorothea’s lofty thoughts of an ideal husband, who would be her superior in learning, and spiritually elevated. Into the picture steps Reverend Casaubon, a clergyman of fifty. Dorothea, not yet eighteen, immediately romanticizes him as a type of Milton or Locke. She wants to devote herself to someone who can teach her wisdom. Mr. Brooke tries to dissuade her from getting engaged to Casaubon, but she accepts him, to everyone’s shock.
Analysis
	One of the main characters of the novel is the narrator who tells the story from the multiple points of view of the characters, while adding her own reflective wisdom. This vantage point gives us compassionate insight into each character but within a certain social context, for the narrator stands for the collective wisdom gleaned from all the lives put together. This narrator is “omniscient” and anonymous, though we can think of her as close to George Eliot’s own viewpoint.
	Immediately, the narrator begins to uncover the fact that most people are lost in their own illusions of reality, one of the themes of the book. She brilliantly weaves together the intersecting illusions of all the characters, showing us the profile of the town of Middlemarch, a fictitious small town in the rural English midlands in the early nineteenth century. Middlemarch stands for English life just before the impact of the industrial revolution. The time is just before the great Reform Bill of 1832. Life is still somewhat simple and conventional here in this backwater, and the citizens are not interested in anything but daily concerns. This sets the stage for their clashes with the more extraordinary and farsighted characters, Dorothea and Lydgate and Will Ladislaw who stand for the forces of change.
	While it could be rather farcical that the beautiful Dorothea, who is constantly compared to the Blessed Virgin, is marrying Casaubon, the “dried bookworm of fifty,” Eliot treats Dorothea’s “soul hunger” as a real and tragic phenomenon in this society. She has no teacher or even comrade to whom she may tell of her own exalted thoughts and wishes. Even her sister Celia, though adoring her, criticizes her, and does not understand her need for living her religious vision in daily life. Dorothea thinks that Casaubon will understand and teach her, while he, it is clear, expects an obedient and self-abnegating wife. The narrator gives us foreshadowing of this problematic marriage by explaining Dorothea’s short-sightedness and “theoretic” nature, desire for “intensity and greatness.” Casaubon also has trouble with his vision and needs a secretary to help him with his life work, The Key to All Mythologies.
