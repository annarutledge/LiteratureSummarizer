 # Comparison of Summarization Models

 ## Best Fine-Tuned Model
 Based on the analysis summarized below, the best performing summarization model is model 13, using the sshleifer/distilbart-xsum-1-1 with increased maximum lengths for model inputs, 25 epochs of training with an earlystopping callback, and weight decay rate of 0.1. This model recieved the highest rouge f1-scores for Rouge1, RougeL, and RougeLsum, and a comparable Rouge2 f1-score to the second best performing model (model 08). The predicted summaries generated by the processing of test data with this model still do not meet the final goal of the fine-tuned modeling -to a produce accurate and human readable summaries of reference texts- but does produce text including some full sentences, and often obviously related to the context/characters/events described in the associated texts and/or reference summaries. There is further work and development to be done on this model, however it represents progress in the right direction towards achieving desired outcomes.
