"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Godliness I - VI","Godliness I This is the first in a four-part story. Jesse Bentley was born sensitive in a family of rough farmers. He went off to study for the ministry and married an equally delicate woman. When all his four older brothers died in the Civil War, he came home to run the farm. Although he was sensitive, there was a strength that ran through him and made him survive a rougher life. He made a success of running the farm, even though no one expected him to be able to do so. Because he was intellectual in an age that did not lend itself to intellectual pursuits, he channeled that energy into a fervent belief in God. In doing so, he became something of a tyrant, feared by his employees. He believed that he had been specially chosen by God, and that all the people in the area were Philistines. He also believed that he needed a son to smite them. His wife died in childbirth. Godliness II Jesse did not have a son. His daughter, Louise, grew up to be a shrill and unhappy woman. She married a banker, John Hardy, and went to live in town. She has a son, David, who is timid and frightened much of the time because his mother is so erratic. Once, returning from his grandfather's farm, he runs away from home. When he returns, he is pleasantly surprised to find his mother is tender for the evening. David goes to live with his grandfather. He is happy on the farm, and everyone dotes on him. Once, his grandfather becomes possessed of the spirit of God while out in the wilderness with David, but this just terrifies the young boy. Other than this frightening event, however, the farm feels comfortable to him. One of his great-aunts mothers him, and he gets love he never felt at home. Godliness III: Surrender Louise grew up in a loveless household, as her father had always wanted a boy and her mother had died. As a teenager, she went to live in town to attend school. She lived in the Hardy household. The two Hardy girls hated her because she was such a good student, which was awful for her because all she wanted was love. When she reached out to their brother, John, he misunderstood and thought she wanted to become his lover. She mistakenly thought she was pregnant, and they ended up married. Because John could never understand the emptiness and need for love that drove her to him, Louise turned into a bitter woman. She neglects her son, David. Godliness IV: Terror The last part of the story returns to the story of Jesse, who meets with great financial success on his farming ventures. He decides to take his fifteen-year-old grandson, David, out into the woods to help him sacrifice a lamb. But he does not tell David what his plan is, and David becomes terrified when his grandfather approaches him and the lamb with a large knife. David runs away. When Jesse pursues him, David hits him with a stone from a slingshot. Thinking he has killed his grandfather, he flees Winesburg for good. Jesse's ambition is chastened by the loss of his beloved grandson. Analysis In the Bible, David slays Goliath the giant with a slingshot. That image is reproduced here. Jesse believes he is a man with a special connection to God, but he is actually a tyrant who needs to be slain. He believes so strongly in one truth, that he is a man chosen by God and surrounded by Philistines, that he has become warped into a grotesque. His single-minded pursuit of godliness through hard work killed his wife and turned his daughter into a miserable woman. Because he believes his grandson is part of his godliness, he makes David's life wonderful. Eventually, however, his belief goes too far and he destroys even that relationship. The truth he has embraced has destroyed every chance he had for human connectedness. ","Winesburg, Ohio",Godliness I - VI," Back to Full Books bySherwood Anderson A Tale in Four Parts THERE WERE ALWAYS three or four old people sitting on the front porch of the house or puttering about the garden of the Bentley farm. Three of the old people were women and sisters to Jesse. They were a colorless, soft voiced lot. Then there was a silent old man with thin white hair who was Jesse's uncle. The farmhouse was built of wood, a board outer- covering over a framework of logs. It was in reality not one house but a cluster of houses joined to- gether in a rather haphazard manner. Inside, the place was full of surprises. One went up steps from the living room into the dining room and there were always steps to be ascended or descended in passing from one room to another. At meal times the place was like a beehive. At one moment all was quiet, then doors began to open, feet clattered on stairs, a murmur of soft voices arose and people appeared from a dozen obscure corners. Besides the old people, already mentioned, many others lived in the Bentley house. There were four hired men, a woman named Aunt Callie Beebe, who was in charge of the housekeeping, a dull-witted girl named Eliza Stoughton, who made beds and helped with the milking, a boy who worked in the stables, and Jesse Bentley himself, the owner and overlord of it all. By the time the American Civil War had been over for twenty years, that part of Northern Ohio where the Bentley farms lay had begun to emerge from pioneer life. Jesse then owned machinery for har- vesting grain. He had built modern barns and most of his land was drained with carefully laid tile drain, but in order to understand the man we will have to go back to an earlier day. The Bentley family had been in Northern Ohio for several generations before Jesse's time. They came from New York State and took up land when the country was new and land could be had at a low price. For a long time they, in common with all the other Middle Western people, were very poor. The land they had settled upon was heavily wooded and covered with fallen logs and underbrush. After the long hard labor of clearing these away and cutting the timber, there were still the stumps to be reck- oned with. Plows run through the fields caught on hidden roots, stones lay all about, on the low places water gathered, and the young corn turned yellow, sickened and died. When Jesse Bentley's father and brothers had come into their ownership of the place, much of the harder part of the work of clearing had been done, but they clung to old traditions and worked like driven animals. They lived as practically all of the farming people of the time lived. In the spring and through most of the winter the highways leading into the town of Winesburg were a sea of mud. The four young men of the family worked hard all day in the fields, they ate heavily of coarse, greasy food, and at night slept like tired beasts on beds of straw. Into their lives came little that was not coarse and brutal and outwardly they were themselves coarse and brutal. On Saturday afternoons they hitched a team of horses to a three-seated wagon and went off to town. In town they stood about the stoves in the stores talking to other farmers or to the store keepers. They were dressed in overalls and in the winter wore heavy coats that were flecked with mud. Their hands as they stretched them out to the heat of the stoves were cracked and red. It was dif- ficult for them to talk and so they for the most part kept silent. When they had bought meat, flour, sugar, and salt, they went into one of the Winesburg saloons and drank beer. Under the influence of drink the naturally strong lusts of their natures, kept suppressed by the heroic labor of breaking up new ground, were released. A kind of crude and animal- like poetic fervor took possession of them. On the road home they stood up on the wagon seats and shouted at the stars. Sometimes they fought long and bitterly and at other times they broke forth into songs. Once Enoch Bentley, the older one of the boys, struck his father, old Tom Bentley, with the butt of a teamster's whip, and the old man seemed likely to die. For days Enoch lay hid in the straw in the loft of the stable ready to flee if the result of his momentary passion turned out to be murder. He was kept alive with food brought by his mother, who also kept him informed of the injured man's condition. When all turned out well he emerged from his hiding place and went back to the work of clearing land as though nothing had happened.  The Civil War brought a sharp turn to the fortunes of the Bentleys and was responsible for the rise of the youngest son, Jesse. Enoch, Edward, Harry, and Will Bentley all enlisted and before the long war ended they were all killed. For a time after they went away to the South, old Tom tried to run the place, but he was not successful. When the last of the four had been killed he sent word to Jesse that he would have to come home. Then the mother, who had not been well for a year, died suddenly, and the father became alto- gether discouraged. He talked of selling the farm and moving into town. All day he went about shak- ing his head and muttering. The work in the fields was neglected and weeds grew high in the corn. Old Tim hired men but he did not use them intelligently. When they had gone away to the fields in the morn- ing he wandered into the woods and sat down on a log. Sometimes he forgot to come home at night and one of the daughters had to go in search of him. When Jesse Bentley came home to the farm and began to take charge of things he was a slight, sensitive-looking man of twenty-two. At eighteen he had left home to go to school to become a scholar and eventually to become a minister of the Presbyte- rian Church. All through his boyhood he had been what in our country was called an ""odd sheep"" and had not got on with his brothers. Of all the family only his mother had understood him and she was now dead. When he came home to take charge of the farm, that had at that time grown to more than six hundred acres, everyone on the farms about and in the nearby town of Winesburg smiled at the idea of his trying to handle the work that had been done by his four strong brothers. There was indeed good cause to smile. By the standards of his day Jesse did not look like a man at all. He was small and very slender and womanish of body and, true to the traditions of young minis- ters, wore a long black coat and a narrow black string tie. The neighbors were amused when they saw him, after the years away, and they were even more amused when they saw the woman he had married in the city. As a matter of fact, Jesse's wife did soon go under. That was perhaps Jesse's fault. A farm in Northern Ohio in the hard years after the Civil War was no place for a delicate woman, and Katherine Bentley was delicate. Jesse was hard with her as he was with everybody about him in those days. She tried to do such work as all the neighbor women about her did and he let her go on without interference. She helped to do the milking and did part of the house- work; she made the beds for the men and prepared their food. For a year she worked every day from sunrise until late at night and then after giving birth to a child she died. As for Jesse Bentley--although he was a delicately built man there was something within him that could not easily be killed. He had brown curly hair and grey eyes that were at times hard and direct, at times wavering and uncertain. Not only was he slen- der but he was also short of stature. His mouth was like the mouth of a sensitive and very determined child. Jesse Bentley was a fanatic. He was a man born out of his time and place and for this he suf- fered and made others suffer. Never did he succeed in getting what he wanted out of fife and he did not know what he wanted. Within a very short time after he came home to the Bentley farm he made everyone there a little afraid of him, and his wife, who should have been close to him as his mother had been, was afraid also. At the end of two weeks after his coming, old Tom Bentley made over to him the entire ownership of the place and retired into the background. Everyone retired into the back- ground. In spite of his youth and inexperience, Jesse had the trick of mastering the souls of his people. He was so in earnest in everything he did and said that no one understood him. He made everyone on the farm work as they had never worked before and yet there was no joy in the work. If things went well they went well for Jesse and never for the people who were his dependents. Like a thousand other strong men who have come into the world here in America in these later times, Jesse was but half strong. He could master others but he could not master himself. The running of the farm as it had never been run before was easy for him. When he came home from Cleveland where he had been in school, he shut himself off from all of his people and began to make plans. He thought about the farm night and day and that made him successful. Other men on the farms about him worked too hard and were too fired to think, but to think of the farm and to be everlastingly making plans for its success was a relief to Jesse. It partially satisfied something in his passionate nature. Immediately after he came home he had a wing built on to the old house and in a large room facing the west he had windows that looked into the barnyard and other windows that looked off across the fields. By the window he sat down to think. Hour after hour and day after day he sat and looked over the land and thought out his new place in life. The passionate burning thing in his nature flamed up and his eyes became hard. He wanted to make the farm produce as no farm in his state had ever produced before and then he wanted something else. It was the indefinable hunger within that made his eyes waver and that kept him always more and more silent before people. He would have given much to achieve peace and in him was a fear that peace was the thing he could not achieve. All over his body Jesse Bentley was alive. In his small frame was gathered the force of a long line of strong men. He had always been extraordinarily alive when he was a small boy on the farm and later when he was a young man in school. In the school he had studied and thought of God and the Bible with his whole mind and heart. As time passed and he grew to know people better, he began to think of himself as an extraordinary man, one set apart from his fellows. He wanted terribly to make his life a thing of great importance, and as he looked about at his fellow men and saw how like clods they lived it seemed to him that he could not bear to become also such a clod. Although in his absorption in him- self and in his own destiny he was blind to the fact that his young wife was doing a strong woman's work even after she had become large with child and that she was killing herself in his service, he did not intend to be unkind to her. When his father, who was old and twisted with toil, made over to him the ownership of the farm and seemed content to creep away to a corner and wait for death, he shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the old man from his mind. In the room by the window overlooking the land that had come down to him sat Jesse thinking of his own affairs. In the stables he could hear the tramp- ing of his horses and the restless movement of his cattle. Away in the fields he could see other cattle wandering over green hills. The voices of men, his men who worked for him, came in to him through the window. From the milkhouse there was the steady thump, thump of a churn being manipulated by the half-witted girl, Eliza Stoughton. Jesse's mind went back to the men of Old Testament days who had also owned lands and herds. He remembered how God had come down out of the skies and talked to these men and he wanted God to notice and to talk to him also. A kind of feverish boyish eagerness to in some way achieve in his own life the flavor of significance that had hung over these men took possession of him. Being a prayerful man he spoke of the matter aloud to God and the sound of his own words strengthened and fed his eagerness. ""I am a new kind of man come into possession of these fields,"" he declared. ""Look upon me, O God, and look Thou also upon my neighbors and all the men who have gone before me here! O God, create in me another Jesse, like that one of old, to rule over men and to be the father of sons who shall be rul- ers!"" Jesse grew excited as he talked aloud and jumping to his feet walked up and down in the room. In fancy he saw himself living in old times and among old peoples. The land that lay stretched out before him became of vast significance, a place peopled by his fancy with a new race of men sprung from himself. It seemed to him that in his day as in those other and older days, kingdoms might be cre- ated and new impulses given to the lives of men by the power of God speaking through a chosen ser- vant. He longed to be such a servant. ""It is God's work I have come to the land to do,"" he declared in a loud voice and his short figure straightened and he thought that something like a halo of Godly ap- proval hung over him.  It will perhaps be somewhat difficult for the men and women of a later day to understand Jesse Bent- ley. In the last fifty years a vast change has taken place in the lives of our people. A revolution has in fact taken place. The coming of industrialism, at- tended by all the roar and rattle of affairs, the shrill cries of millions of new voices that have come among us from overseas, the going and coming of trains, the growth of cities, the building of the inter- urban car lines that weave in and out of towns and past farmhouses, and now in these later days the coming of the automobiles has worked a tremen- dous change in the lives and in the habits of thought of our people of Mid-America. Books, badly imag- ined and written though they may be in the hurry of our times, are in every household, magazines cir- culate by the millions of copies, newspapers are ev- erywhere. In our day a farmer standing by the stove in the store in his village has his mind filled to over- flowing with the words of other men. The newspa- pers and the magazines have pumped him full. Much of the old brutal ignorance that had in it also a kind of beautiful childlike innocence is gone for- ever. The farmer by the stove is brother to the men of the cities, and if you listen you will find him talking as glibly and as senselessly as the best city man of us all. In Jesse Bentley's time and in the country districts of the whole Middle West in the years after the Civil War it was not so. Men labored too hard and were too tired to read. In them was no desire for words printed upon paper. As they worked in the fields, vague, half-formed thoughts took possession of them. They believed in God and in God's power to control their lives. In the little Protestant churches they gathered on Sunday to hear of God and his works. The churches were the center of the social and intellectual life of the times. The figure of God was big in the hearts of men. And so, having been born an imaginative child and having within him a great intellectual eagerness, Jesse Bentley had turned wholeheartedly toward God. When the war took his brothers away, he saw the hand of God in that. When his father became ill and could no longer attend to the running of the farm, he took that also as a sign from God. In the city, when the word came to him, he walked about at night through the streets thinking of the matter and when he had come home and had got the work on the farm well under way, he went again at night to walk through the forests and over the low hills and to think of God. As he walked the importance of his own figure in some divine plan grew in his mind. He grew avari- cious and was impatient that the farm contained only six hundred acres. Kneeling in a fence corner at the edge of some meadow, he sent his voice abroad into the silence and looking up he saw the stars shining down at him. One evening, some months after his father's death, and when his wife Katherine was expecting at any moment to be laid abed of childbirth, Jesse left his house and went for a long walk. The Bentley farm was situated in a tiny valley watered by Wine Creek, and Jesse walked along the banks of the stream to the end of his own land and on through the fields of his neighbors. As he walked the valley broadened and then narrowed again. Great open stretches of field and wood lay before him. The moon came out from behind clouds, and, climbing a low hill, he sat down to think. Jesse thought that as the true servant of God the entire stretch of country through which he had walked should have come into his possession. He thought of his dead brothers and blamed them that they had not worked harder and achieved more. Be- fore him in the moonlight the tiny stream ran down over stones, and he began to think of the men of old times who like himself had owned flocks and lands. A fantastic impulse, half fear, half greediness, took possession of Jesse Bentley. He remembered how in the old Bible story the Lord had appeared to that other Jesse and told him to send his son David to where Saul and the men of Israel were fighting the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. Into Jesse's mind came the conviction that all of the Ohio farmers who owned land in the valley of Wine Creek were Philistines and enemies of God. ""Suppose,"" he whispered to himself, ""there should come from among them one who, like Goliath the Philistine of Gath, could defeat me and take from me my posses- sions."" In fancy he felt the sickening dread that he thought must have lain heavy on the heart of Saul before the coming of David. Jumping to his feet, he began to run through the night. As he ran he called to God. His voice carried far over the low hills. ""Jehovah of Hosts,"" he cried, ""send to me this night out of the womb of Katherine, a son. Let Thy grace alight upon me. Send me a son to be called David who shall help me to pluck at last all of these lands out of the hands of the Philistines and turn them to Thy service and to the building of Thy kingdom on earth.""  II DAVID HARDY OF  , was the grand- son of Jesse Bentley, the owner of Bentley farms. When he was twelve years old he went to the old Bentley place to live. His mother, Louise Bentley, the girl who came into the world on that night when Jesse ran through the fields crying to God that he be given a son, had grown to womanhood on the farm and had married young John Hardy of Wines- burg, who became a banker. Louise and her hus- band did not live happily together and everyone agreed that she was to blame. She was a small woman with sharp grey eyes and black hair. From childhood she had been inclined to fits of temper and when not angry she was often morose and si- lent. In Winesburg it was said that she drank. Her husband, the banker, who was a careful, shrewd man, tried hard to make her happy. When he began to make money he bought for her a large brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg and he was the first man in that town to keep a manservant to drive his wife's carriage. But Louise could not be made happy. She flew into half insane fits of temper during which she was sometimes silent, sometimes noisy and quarrelsome. She swore and cried out in her anger. She got a knife from the kitchen and threatened her husband's life. Once she deliberately set fire to the house, and often she hid herself away for days in her own room and would see no one. Her life, lived as a half re- cluse, gave rise to all sorts of stories concerning her. It was said that she took drugs and that she hid herself away from people because she was often so under the influence of drink that her condition could not be concealed. Sometimes on summer afternoons she came out of the house and got into her carriage. Dismissing the driver she took the reins in her own hands and drove off at top speed through the streets. If a pedestrian got in her way she drove straight ahead and the frightened citizen had to es- cape as best he could. To the people of the town it seemed as though she wanted to run them down. When she had driven through several streets, tear- ing around corners and beating the horses with the whip, she drove off into the country. On the country roads after she had gotten out of sight of the houses she let the horses slow down to a walk and her wild, reckless mood passed. She became thoughtful and muttered words. Sometimes tears came into her eyes. And then when she came back into town she again drove furiously through the quiet streets. But for the influence of her husband and the respect he inspired in people's minds she would have been arrested more than once by the town marshal. Young David Hardy grew up in the house with this woman and as can well be imagined there was not much joy in his childhood. He was too young then to have opinions of his own about people, but at times it was difficult for him not to have very definite opinions about the woman who was his mother. David was always a quiet, orderly boy and for a long time was thought by the people of Wines- burg to be something of a dullard. His eyes were brown and as a child he had a habit of looking at things and people a long time without appearing to see what he was looking at. When he heard his mother spoken of harshly or when he overheard her berating his father, he was frightened and ran away to hide. Sometimes he could not find a hiding place and that confused him. Turning his face toward a tree or if he was indoors toward the wall, he closed his eyes and tried not to think of anything. He had a habit of talking aloud to himself, and early in life a spirit of quiet sadness often took possession of him. On the occasions when David went to visit his grandfather on the Bentley farm, he was altogether contented and happy. Often he wished that he would never have to go back to town and once when he had come home from the farm after a long visit, something happened that had a lasting effect on his mind. David had come back into town with one of the hired men. The man was in a hurry to go about his own affairs and left the boy at the head of the street in which the Hardy house stood. It was early dusk of a fall evening and the sky was overcast with clouds. Something happened to David. He could not bear to go into the house where his mother and father lived, and on an impulse he decided to run away from home. He intended to go back to the farm and to his grandfather, but lost his way and for hours he wandered weeping and frightened on country roads. It started to rain and lightning flashed in the sky. The boy's imagination was ex- cited and he fancied that he could see and hear strange things in the darkness. Into his mind came the conviction that he was walking and running in some terrible void where no one had ever been be- fore. The darkness about him seemed limitless. The sound of the wind blowing in trees was terrifying. When a team of horses approached along the road in which he walked he was frightened and climbed a fence. Through a field he ran until he came into another road and getting upon his knees felt of the soft ground with his fingers. But for the figure of his grandfather, whom he was afraid he would never find in the darkness, he thought the world must be altogether empty. When his cries were heard by a farmer who was walking home from town and he was brought back to his father's house, he was so tired and excited that he did not know what was happening to him. By chance David's father knew that he had disap- peared. On the street he had met the farm hand from the Bentley place and knew of his son's return to town. When the boy did not come home an alarm was set up and John Hardy with several men of the town went to search the country. The report that David had been kidnapped ran about through the streets of Winesburg. When he came home there were no lights in the house, but his mother ap- peared and clutched him eagerly in her arms. David thought she had suddenly become another woman. He could not believe that so delightful a thing had happened. With her own hands Louise Hardy bathed his tired young body and cooked him food. She would not let him go to bed but, when he had put on his nightgown, blew out the lights and sat down in a chair to hold him in her arms. For an hour the woman sat in the darkness and held her boy. All the time she kept talking in a low voice. David could not understand what had so changed her. Her habit- ually dissatisfied face had become, he thought, the most peaceful and lovely thing he had ever seen. When he began to weep she held him more and more tightly. On and on went her voice. It was not harsh or shrill as when she talked to her husband, but was like rain falling on trees. Presently men began coming to the door to report that he had not been found, but she made him hide and be silent until she had sent them away. He thought it must be a game his mother and the men of the town were playing with him and laughed joyously. Into his mind came the thought that his having been lost and frightened in the darkness was an altogether unimportant matter. He thought that he would have been willing to go through the frightful experience a thousand times to be sure of finding at the end of the long black road a thing so lovely as his mother had suddenly become.  During the last years of young David's boyhood he saw his mother but seldom and she became for him just a woman with whom he had once lived. Still he could not get her figure out of his mind and as he grew older it became more definite. When he was twelve years old he went to the Bentley farm to live. Old Jesse came into town and fairly de- manded that he be given charge of the boy. The old man was excited and determined on having his own way. He talked to John Hardy in the office of the Winesburg Savings Bank and then the two men went to the house on Elm Street to talk with Louise. They both expected her to make trouble but were mistaken. She was very quiet and when Jesse had explained his mission and had gone on at some length about the advantages to come through having the boy out of doors and in the quiet atmosphere of the old farmhouse, she nodded her head in ap- proval. ""It is an atmosphere not corrupted by my presence,"" she said sharply. Her shoulders shook and she seemed about to fly into a fit of temper. ""It is a place for a man child, although it was never a place for me,"" she went on. ""You never wanted me there and of course the air of your house did me no good. It was like poison in my blood but it will be different with him."" Louise turned and went out of the room, leaving the two men to sit in embarrassed silence. As very often happened she later stayed in her room for days. Even when the boy's clothes were packed and he was taken away she did not appear. The loss of her son made a sharp break in her life and she seemed less inclined to quarrel with her husband. John Hardy thought it had all turned out very well indeed. And so young David went to live in the Bentley farmhouse with Jesse. Two of the old farmer's sisters were alive and still lived in the house. They were afraid of Jesse and rarely spoke when he was about. One of the women who had been noted for her flaming red hair when she was younger was a born mother and became the boy's caretaker. Every night when he had gone to bed she went into his room and sat on the floor until he fell asleep. When he became drowsy she became bold and whispered things that he later thought he must have dreamed. Her soft low voice called him endearing names and he dreamed that his mother had come to him and that she had changed so that she was always as she had been that time after he ran away. He also grew bold and reaching out his hand stroked the face of the woman on the floor so that she was ec- statically happy. Everyone in the old house became happy after the boy went there. The hard insistent thing in Jesse Bentley that had kept the people in the house silent and timid and that had never been dispelled by the presence of the girl Louise was ap- parently swept away by the coming of the boy. It was as though God had relented and sent a son to the man. The man who had proclaimed himself the only true servant of God in all the valley of Wine Creek, and who had wanted God to send him a sign of approval by way of a son out of the womb of Kather- ine, began to think that at last his prayers had been answered. Although he was at that time only fifty- five years old he looked seventy and was worn out with much thinking and scheming. The effort he had made to extend his land holdings had been suc- cessful and there were few farms in the valley that did not belong to him, but until David came he was a bitterly disappointed man. There were two influences at work in Jesse Bent- ley and all his life his mind had been a battleground for these influences. First there was the old thing in him. He wanted to be a man of God and a leader among men of God. His walking in the fields and through the forests at night had brought him close to nature and there were forces in the passionately religious man that ran out to the forces in nature. The disappointment that had come to him when a daughter and not a son had been born to Katherine had fallen upon him like a blow struck by some unseen hand and the blow had somewhat softened his egotism. He still believed that God might at any moment make himself manifest out of the winds or the clouds, but he no longer demanded such recog- nition. Instead he prayed for it. Sometimes he was altogether doubtful and thought God had deserted the world. He regretted the fate that had not let him live in a simpler and sweeter time when at the beckoning of some strange cloud in the sky men left their lands and houses and went forth into the wilderness to create new races. While he worked night and day to make his farms more productive and to extend his holdings of land, he regretted that he could not use his own restless energy in the building of temples, the slaying of unbelievers and in general in the work of glorifying God's name on earth. That is what Jesse hungered for and then also he hungered for something else. He had grown into maturity in America in the years after the Civil War and he, like all men of his time, had been touched by the deep influences that were at work in the country during those years when modem industrial- ism was being born. He began to buy machines that would permit him to do the work of the farms while employing fewer men and he sometimes thought that if he were a younger man he would give up farming altogether and start a factory in Winesburg for the making of machinery. Jesse formed the habit of reading newspapers and magazines. He invented a machine for the making of fence out of wire. Faintly he realized that the atmosphere of old times and places that he had always cultivated in his own mind was strange and foreign to the thing that was growing up in the minds of others. The beginning of the most materialistic age in the history of the world, when wars would be fought without patrio- tism, when men would forget God and only pay attention to moral standards, when the will to power would replace the will to serve and beauty would be well-nigh forgotten in the terrible headlong rush of mankind toward the acquiring of possessions, was telling its story to Jesse the man of God as it was to the men about him. The greedy thing in him wanted to make money faster than it could be made by tilling the land. More than once he went into Winesburg to talk with his son-in-law John Hardy about it. ""You are a banker and you will have chances I never had,"" he said and his eyes shone. ""I am thinking about it all the time. Big things are going to be done in the country and there will be more money to be made than I ever dreamed of. You get into it. I wish I were younger and had your chance."" Jesse Bentley walked up and down in the bank office and grew more and more excited as he talked. At one time in his life he had been threat- ened with paralysis and his left side remained some- what weakened. As he talked his left eyelid twitched. Later when he drove back home and when night came on and the stars came out it was harder to get back the old feeling of a close and personal God who lived in the sky overhead and who might at any moment reach out his hand, touch him on the shoulder, and appoint for him some heroic task to be done. Jesse's mind was fixed upon the things read in newspapers and magazines, on fortunes to be made almost without effort by shrewd men who bought and sold. For him the coming of the boy David did much to bring back with renewed force the old faith and it seemed to him that God had at last looked with favor upon him. As for the boy on the farm, life began to reveal itself to him in a thousand new and delightful ways. The kindly attitude of all about him expanded his quiet nature and he lost the half timid, hesitating manner he had always had with his people. At night when he went to bed after a long day of adventures in the stables, in the fields, or driving about from farm to farm with his grandfather, he wanted to embrace everyone in the house. If Sherley Bentley, the woman who came each night to sit on the floor by his bedside, did not appear at once, he went to the head of the stairs and shouted, his young voice ringing through the narrow halls where for so long there had been a tradition of silence. In the morning when he awoke and lay still in bed, the sounds that came in to him through the windows filled him with delight. He thought with a shudder of the life in the house in Winesburg and of his mother's angry voice that had always made him tremble. There in the country all sounds were pleasant sounds. When he awoke at dawn the barnyard back of the house also awoke. In the house people stirred about. Eliza Stoughton the half-witted girl was poked in the ribs by a farm hand and giggled noisily, in some distant field a cow bawled and was answered by the cattle in the stables, and one of the farm hands spoke sharply to the horse he was grooming by the stable door. David leaped out of bed and ran to a window. All of the people stirring about excited his mind, and he wondered what his mother was doing in the house in town. From the windows of his own room he could not see directly into the barnyard where the farm hands had now all assembled to do the morning shores, but he could hear the voices of the men and the neighing of the horses. When one of the men laughed, he laughed also. Leaning out at the open window, he looked into an orchard where a fat sow wandered about with a litter of tiny pigs at her heels. Every morning he counted the pigs. ""Four, five, six, seven,"" he said slowly, wetting his finger and making straight up and down marks on the window ledge. David ran to put on his trousers and shirt. A feverish desire to get out of doors took pos- session of him. Every morning he made such a noise coming down stairs that Aunt Callie, the house- keeper, declared he was trying to tear the house down. When he had run through the long old house, shutting the doors behind him with a bang, he came into the barnyard and looked about with an amazed air of expectancy. It seemed to him that in such a place tremendous things might have hap- pened during the night. The farm hands looked at him and laughed. Henry Strader, an old man who had been on the farm since Jesse came into posses- sion and who before David's time had never been known to make a joke, made the same joke every morning. It amused David so that he laughed and clapped his hands. ""See, come here and look,"" cried the old man. ""Grandfather Jesse's white mare has tom the black stocking she wears on her foot."" Day after day through the long summer, Jesse Bentley drove from farm to farm up and down the valley of Wine Creek, and his grandson went with him. They rode in a comfortable old phaeton drawn by the white horse. The old man scratched his thin white beard and talked to himself of his plans for increasing the productiveness of the fields they vis- ited and of God's part in the plans all men made. Sometimes he looked at David and smiled happily and then for a long time he appeared to forget the boy's existence. More and more every day now his mind turned back again to the dreams that had filled his mind when he had first come out of the city to live on the land. One afternoon he startled David by letting his dreams take entire possession of him. With the boy as a witness, he went through a cere- mony and brought about an accident that nearly de- stroyed the companionship that was growing up between them. Jesse and his grandson were driving in a distant part of the valley some miles from home. A forest came down to the road and through the forest Wine Creek wriggled its way over stones toward a distant river. All the afternoon Jesse had been in a medita- tive mood and now he began to talk. His mind went back to the night when he had been frightened by thoughts of a giant that might come to rob and plun- der him of his possessions, and again as on that night when he had run through the fields crying for a son, he became excited to the edge of insanity. Stopping the horse he got out of the buggy and asked David to get out also. The two climbed over a fence and walked along the bank of the stream. The boy paid no attention to the muttering of his grandfather, but ran along beside him and won- dered what was going to happen. When a rabbit jumped up and ran away through the woods, he clapped his hands and danced with delight. He looked at the tall trees and was sorry that he was not a little animal to climb high in the air without being frightened. Stooping, he picked up a small stone and threw it over the head of his grandfather into a clump of bushes. ""Wake up, little animal. Go and climb to the top of the trees,"" he shouted in a shrill voice. Jesse Bentley went along under the trees with his head bowed and with his mind in a ferment. His earnestness affected the boy, who presently became silent and a little alarmed. Into the old man's mind had come the notion that now he could bring from God a word or a sign out of the sky, that the pres- ence of the boy and man on their knees in some lonely spot in the forest would make the miracle he had been waiting for almost inevitable. ""It was in just such a place as this that other David tended the sheep when his father came and told him to go down unto Saul,"" he muttered. Taking the boy rather roughly by the shoulder, he climbed over a fallen log and when he had come to an open place among the trees he dropped upon his knees and began to pray in a loud voice. A kind of terror he had never known before took possession of David. Crouching beneath a tree he watched the man on the ground before him and his own knees began to tremble. It seemed to him that he was in the presence not only of his grandfather but of someone else, someone who might hurt him, someone who was not kindly but dangerous and brutal. He began to cry and reaching down picked up a small stick, which he held tightly gripped in his fingers. When Jesse Bentley, absorbed in his own idea, suddenly arose and advanced toward him, his terror grew until his whole body shook. In the woods an intense silence seemed to lie over every- thing and suddenly out of the silence came the old man's harsh and insistent voice. Gripping the boy's shoulders, Jesse turned his face to the sky and shouted. The whole left side of his face twitched and his hand on the boy's shoulder twitched also. ""Make a sign to me, God,"" he cried. ""Here I stand with the boy David. Come down to me out of the sky and make Thy presence known to me."" With a cry of fear, David turned and, shaking himself loose from the hands that held him, ran away through the forest. He did not believe that the man who turned up his face and in a harsh voice shouted at the sky was his grandfather at all. The man did not look like his grandfather. The convic- tion that something strange and terrible had hap- pened, that by some miracle a new and dangerous person had come into the body of the kindly old man, took possession of him. On and on he ran down the hillside, sobbing as he ran. When he fell over the roots of a tree and in falling struck his head, he arose and tried to run on again. His head hurt so that presently he fell down and lay still, but it was only after Jesse had carried him to the buggy and he awoke to find the old man's hand stroking his head tenderly that the terror left him. ""Take me away. There is a terrible man back there in the woods,"" he declared firmly, while Jesse looked away over the tops of the trees and again his lips cried out to God. ""What have I done that Thou dost not approve of me,"" he whispered softly, saying the words over and over as he drove rapidly along the road with the boy's cut and bleeding head held ten- derly against his shoulder.  III Surrender THE STORY OF Louise Bentley, who became Mrs. John Hardy and lived with her husband in a brick house on Elm Street in Winesburg, is a story of mis- understanding. Before such women as Louise can be understood and their lives made livable, much will have to be done. Thoughtful books will have to be written and thoughtful lives lived by people about them. Born of a delicate and overworked mother, and an impulsive, hard, imaginative father, who did not look with favor upon her coming into the world, Louise was from childhood a neurotic, one of the race of over-sensitive women that in later days in- dustrialism was to bring in such great numbers into the world. During her early years she lived on the Bentley farm, a silent, moody child, wanting love more than anything else in the world and not getting it. When she was fifteen she went to live in Winesburg with the family of Albert Hardy, who had a store for the sale of buggies and wagons, and who was a member of the town board of education. Louise went into town to be a student in the Winesburg High School and she went to live at the Hardys' because Albert Hardy and her father were friends. Hardy, the vehicle merchant of Winesburg, like thousands of other men of his times, was an enthu- siast on the subject of education. He had made his own way in the world without learning got from books, but he was convinced that had he but known books things would have gone better with him. To everyone who came into his shop he talked of the matter, and in his own household he drove his fam- ily distracted by his constant harping on the subject. He had two daughters and one son, John Hardy, and more than once the daughters threatened to leave school altogether. As a matter of principle they did just enough work in their classes to avoid pun- ishment. ""I hate books and I hate anyone who likes books,"" Harriet, the younger of the two girls, de- clared passionately. In Winesburg as on the farm Louise was not happy. For years she had dreamed of the time when she could go forth into the world, and she looked upon the move into the Hardy household as a great step in the direction of freedom. Always when she had thought of the matter, it had seemed to her that in town all must be gaiety and life, that there men and women must live happily and freely, giving and taking friendship and affection as one takes the feel of a wind on the cheek. After the silence and the cheerlessness of life in the Bentley house, she dreamed of stepping forth into an atmosphere that was warm and pulsating with life and reality. And in the Hardy household Louise might have got something of the thing for which she so hungered but for a mistake she made when she had just come to town. Louise won the disfavor of the two Hardy girls, Mary and Harriet, by her application to her studies in school. She did not come to the house until the day when school was to begin and knew nothing of the feeling they had in the matter. She was timid and during the first month made no acquaintances. Every Friday afternoon one of the hired men from the farm drove into Winesburg and took her home for the week-end, so that she did not spend the Saturday holiday with the town people. Because she was embarrassed and lonely she worked constantly at her studies. To Mary and Harriet, it seemed as though she tried to make trouble for them by her proficiency. In her eagerness to appear well Louise wanted to answer every question put to the class by the teacher. She jumped up and down and her eyes flashed. Then when she had answered some ques- tion the others in the class had been unable to an- swer, she smiled happily. ""See, I have done it for you,"" her eyes seemed to say. ""You need not bother about the matter. I will answer all questions. For the whole class it will be easy while I am here."" In the evening after supper in the Hardy house, Albert Hardy began to praise Louise. One of the teachers had spoken highly of her and he was de- lighted. ""Well, again I have heard of it,"" he began, looking hard at his daughters and then turning to smile at Louise. ""Another of the teachers has told me of the good work Louise is doing. Everyone in Winesburg is telling me how smart she is. I am ashamed that they do not speak so of my own girls."" Arising, the merchant marched about the room and lighted his evening cigar. The two girls looked at each other and shook their heads wearily. Seeing their indifference the father became angry. ""I tell you it is something for you two to be thinking about,"" he cried, glaring at them. ""There is a big change coming here in America and in learning is the only hope of the coming genera- tions. Louise is the daughter of a rich man but she is not ashamed to study. It should make you ashamed to see what she does."" The merchant took his hat from a rack by the door and prepared to depart for the evening. At the door he stopped and glared back. So fierce was his man- ner that Louise was frightened and ran upstairs to her own room. The daughters began to speak of their own affairs. ""Pay attention to me,"" roared the merchant. ""Your minds are lazy. Your indifference to education is affecting your characters. You will amount to nothing. Now mark what I say--Louise will be so far ahead of you that you will never catch up."" The distracted man went out of the house and into the street shaking with wrath. He went along muttering words and swearing, but when he got into Main Street his anger passed. He stopped to talk of the weather or the crops with some other merchant or with a farmer who had come into town and forgot his daughters altogether or, if he thought of them, only shrugged his shoulders. ""Oh, well, girls will be girls,"" he muttered philosophically. In the house when Louise came down into the room where the two girls sat, they would have noth- ing to do with her. One evening after she had been there for more than six weeks and was heartbroken because of the continued air of coldness with which she was always greeted, she burst into tears. ""Shut up your crying and go back to your own room and to your books,"" Mary Hardy said sharply.   * * * The room occupied by Louise was on the second floor of the Hardy house, and her window looked out upon an orchard. There was a stove in the room and every evening young John Hardy carried up an armful of wood and put it in a box that stood by the wall. During the second month after she came to the house, Louise gave up all hope of getting on a friendly footing with the Hardy girls and went to her own room as soon as the evening meal was at an end. Her mind began to play with thoughts of making friends with John Hardy. When he came into the room with the wood in his arms, she pretended to be busy with her studies but watched him eagerly. When he had put the wood in the box and turned to go out, she put down her head and blushed. She tried to make talk but could say nothing, and after he had gone she was angry at herself for her stupidity. The mind of the country girl became filled with the idea of drawing close to the young man. She thought that in him might be found the quality she had all her life been seeking in people. It seemed to her that between herself and all the other people in the world, a wall had been built up and that she was living just on the edge of some warm inner circle of life that must be quite open and under- standable to others. She became obsessed with the thought that it wanted but a courageous act on her part to make all of her association with people some- thing quite different, and that it was possible by such an act to pass into a new life as one opens a door and goes into a room. Day and night she thought of the matter, but although the thing she wanted so earnestly was something very warm and close it had as yet no conscious connection with sex. It had not become that definite, and her mind had only alighted upon the person of John Hardy because he was at hand and unlike his sisters had not been un- friendly to her. The Hardy sisters, Mary and Harriet, were both older than Louise. In a certain kind of knowledge of the world they were years older. They lived as all of the young women of Middle Western towns lived. In those days young women did not go out of our towns to Eastern colleges and ideas in regard to social classes had hardly begun to exist. A daugh- ter of a laborer was in much the same social position as a daughter of a farmer or a merchant, and there were no leisure classes. A girl was ""nice"" or she was ""not nice."" If a nice girl, she had a young man who came to her house to see her on Sunday and on Wednesday evenings. Sometimes she went with her young man to a dance or a church social. At other times she received him at the house and was given the use of the parlor for that purpose. No one in- truded upon her. For hours the two sat behind closed doors. Sometimes the lights were turned low and the young man and woman embraced. Cheeks became hot and hair disarranged. After a year or two, if the impulse within them became strong and insistent enough, they married. One evening during her first winter in Winesburg, Louise had an adventure that gave a new impulse to her desire to break down the wall that she thought stood between her and John Hardy. It was Wednesday and immediately after the evening meal Albert Hardy put on his hat and went away. Young John brought the wood and put it in the box in Louise's room. ""You do work hard, don't you?"" he said awkwardly, and then before she could answer he also went away. Louise heard him go out of the house and had a mad desire to run after him. Opening her window she leaned out and called softly, ""John, dear John, come back, don't go away."" The night was cloudy and she could not see far into the darkness, but as she waited she fancied she could hear a soft little noise as of someone going on tiptoes through the trees in the orchard. She was frightened and closed the window quickly. For an hour she moved about the room trembling with excitement and when she could not longer bear the waiting, she crept into the hall and down the stairs into a closet-like room that opened off the parlor. Louise had decided that she would perform the courageous act that had for weeks been in her mind. She was convinced that John Hardy had concealed himself in the orchard beneath her window and she was determined to find him and tell him that she wanted him to come close to her, to hold her in his arms, to tell her of his thoughts and dreams and to listen while she told him her thoughts and dreams. ""In the darkness it will be easier to say things,"" she whispered to herself, as she stood in the little room groping for the door. And then suddenly Louise realized that she was not alone in the house. In the parlor on the other side of the door a man's voice spoke softly and the door opened. Louise just had time to conceal herself in a little opening beneath the stairway when Mary Hardy, accompanied by her young man, came into the little dark room. For an hour Louise sat on the floor in the darkness and listened. Without words Mary Hardy, with the aid of the man who had come to spend the evening with her, brought to the country girl a knowledge of men and women. Putting her head down until she was curled into a little ball she lay perfectly still. It seemed to her that by some strange impulse of the gods, a great gift had been brought to Mary Hardy and she could not understand the older wom- an's determined protest. The young man took Mary Hardy into his arms and kissed her. When she struggled and laughed, he but held her the more tightly. For an hour the contest between them went on and then they went back into the parlor and Louise escaped up the stairs. ""I hope you were quiet out there. You must not disturb the little mouse at her studies,"" she heard Harriet saying to her sister as she stood by her own door in the hallway above. Louise wrote a note to John Hardy and late that night, when all in the house were asleep, she crept downstairs and slipped it under his door. She was afraid that if she did not do the thing at once her courage would fail. In the note she tried to be quite definite about what she wanted. ""I want someone to love me and I want to love someone,"" she wrote. ""If you are the one for me I want you to come into the orchard at night and make a noise under my window. It will be easy for me to crawl down over the shed and come to you. I am thinking about it all the time, so if you are to come at all you must come soon."" For a long time Louise did not know what would be the outcome of her bold attempt to secure for herself a lover. In a way she still did not know whether or not she wanted him to come. Sometimes it seemed to her that to be held tightly and kissed was the whole secret of life, and then a new impulse came and she was terribly afraid. The age-old wom- an's desire to be possessed had taken possession of her, but so vague was her notion of life that it seemed to her just the touch of John Hardy's hand upon her own hand would satisfy. She wondered if he would understand that. At the table next day while Albert Hardy talked and the two girls whis- pered and laughed, she did not look at John but at the table and as soon as possible escaped. In the evening she went out of the house until she was sure he had taken the wood to her room and gone away. When after several evenings of intense lis- tening she heard no call from the darkness in the orchard, she was half beside herself with grief and decided that for her there was no way to break through the wall that had shut her off from the joy of life. And then on a Monday evening two or three weeks after the writing of the note, John Hardy came for her. Louise had so entirely given up the thought of his coming that for a long time she did not hear the call that came up from the orchard. On the Friday evening before, as she was being driven back to the farm for the week-end by one of the hired men, she had on an impulse done a thing that had startled her, and as John Hardy stood in the darkness below and called her name softly and insis- tently, she walked about in her room and wondered what new impulse had led her to commit so ridicu- lous an act. The farm hand, a young fellow with black curly hair, had come for her somewhat late on that Friday evening and they drove home in the darkness. Lou- ise, whose mind was filled with thoughts of John Hardy, tried to make talk but the country boy was embarrassed and would say nothing. Her mind began to review the loneliness of her childhood and she remembered with a pang the sharp new loneli- ness that had just come to her. ""I hate everyone,"" she cried suddenly, and then broke forth into a ti- rade that frightened her escort. ""I hate father and the old man Hardy, too,"" she declared vehemently. ""I get my lessons there in the school in town but I hate that also."" Louise frightened the farm hand still more by turning and putting her cheek down upon his shoul- der. Vaguely she hoped that he like that young man who had stood in the darkness with Mary would put his arms about her and kiss her, but the country boy was only alarmed. He struck the horse with the whip and began to whistle. ""The road is rough, eh?"" he said loudly. Louise was so angry that reaching up she snatched his hat from his head and threw it into the road. When he jumped out of the buggy and went to get it, she drove off and left him to walk the rest of the way back to the farm. Louise Bentley took John Hardy to be her lover. That was not what she wanted but it was so the young man had interpreted her approach to him, and so anxious was she to achieve something else that she made no resistance. When after a few months they were both afraid that she was about to become a mother, they went one evening to the county seat and were married. For a few months they lived in the Hardy house and then took a house of their own. All during the first year Louise tried to make her husband understand the vague and in- tangible hunger that had led to the writing of the note and that was still unsatisfied. Again and again she crept into his arms and tried to talk of it, but always without success. Filled with his own notions of love between men and women, he did not listen but began to kiss her upon the lips. That confused her so that in the end she did not want to be kissed. She did not know what she wanted. When the alarm that had tricked them into mar- riage proved to be groundless, she was angry and said bitter, hurtful things. Later when her son David was born, she could not nurse him and did not know whether she wanted him or not. Sometimes she stayed in the room with him all day, walking about and occasionally creeping close to touch him tenderly with her hands, and then other days came when she did not want to see or be near the tiny bit of humanity that had come into the house. When John Hardy reproached her for her cruelty, she laughed. ""It is a man child and will get what it wants anyway,"" she said sharply. ""Had it been a woman child there is nothing in the world I would not have done for it.""  IV Terror WHEN DAVID HARDY was a tall boy of fifteen, he, like his mother, had an adventure that changed the whole current of his life and sent him out of his quiet corner into the world. The shell of the circum- stances of his life was broken and he was compelled to start forth. He left Winesburg and no one there ever saw him again. After his disappearance, his mother and grandfather both died and his father be- came very rich. He spent much money in trying to locate his son, but that is no part of this story. It was in the late fall of an unusual year on the Bentley farms. Everywhere the crops had been heavy. That spring, Jesse had bought part of a long strip of black swamp land that lay in the valley of Wine Creek. He got the land at a low price but had spent a large sum of money to improve it. Great ditches had to be dug and thousands of tile laid. Neighboring farmers shook their heads over the ex- pense. Some of them laughed and hoped that Jesse would lose heavily by the venture, but the old man went silently on with the work and said nothing. When the land was drained he planted it to cab- bages and onions, and again the neighbors laughed. The crop was, however, enormous and brought high prices. In the one year Jesse made enough money to pay for all the cost of preparing the land and had a surplus that enabled him to buy two more farms. He was exultant and could not conceal his delight. For the first time in all the history of his ownership of the farms, he went among his men with a smiling face. Jesse bought a great many new machines for cut- ting down the cost of labor and all of the remaining acres in the strip of black fertile swamp land. One day he went into Winesburg and bought a bicycle and a new suit of clothes for David and he gave his two sisters money with which to go to a religious convention at Cleveland, Ohio. In the fall of that year when the frost came and the trees in the forests along Wine Creek were golden brown, David spent every moment when he did not have to attend school, out in the open. Alone or with other boys he went every afternoon into the woods to gather nuts. The other boys of the countryside, most of them sons of laborers on the Bentley farms, had guns with which they went hunting rabbits and squirrels, but David did not go with them. He made himself a sling with rubber bands and a forked stick and went off by himself to gather nuts. As he went about thoughts came to him. He realized that he was almost a man and won- dered what he would do in life, but before they came to anything, the thoughts passed and he was a boy again. One day he killed a squirrel that sat on one of the lower branches of a tree and chattered at him. Home he ran with the squirrel in his hand. One of the Bentley sisters cooked the little animal and he ate it with great gusto. The skin he tacked on a board and suspended the board by a string from his bedroom window. That gave his mind a new turn. After that he never went into the woods without carrying the sling in his pocket and he spent hours shooting at imaginary animals concealed among the brown leaves in the trees. Thoughts of his coming manhood passed and he was content to be a boy with a boy's impulses. One Saturday morning when he was about to set off for the woods with the sling in his pocket and a bag for nuts on his shoulder, his grandfather stopped him. In the eyes of the old man was the strained serious look that always a little frightened David. At such times Jesse Bentley's eyes did not look straight ahead but wavered and seemed to be looking at nothing. Something like an invisible curtain ap- peared to have come between the man and all the rest of the world. ""I want you to come with me,"" he said briefly, and his eyes looked over the boy's head into the sky. ""We have something important to do today. You may bring the bag for nuts if you wish. It does not matter and anyway we will be going into the woods."" Jesse and David set out from the Bentley farm- house in the old phaeton that was drawn by the white horse. When they had gone along in silence for a long way they stopped at the edge of a field where a flock of sheep were grazing. Among the sheep was a lamb that had been born out of season, and this David and his grandfather caught and tied so tightly that it looked like a little white ball. When they drove on again Jesse let David hold the lamb in his arms. ""I saw it yesterday and it put me in mind of what I have long wanted to do,"" he said, and again he looked away over the head of the boy with the wavering, uncertain stare in his eyes. After the feeling of exaltation that had come to the farmer as a result of his successful year, another mood had taken possession of him. For a long time he had been going about feeling very humble and prayerful. Again he walked alone at night thinking of God and as he walked he again connected his own figure with the figures of old days. Under the stars he knelt on the wet grass and raised up his voice in prayer. Now he had decided that like the men whose stories filled the pages of the Bible, he would make a sacrifice to God. ""I have been given these abundant crops and God has also sent me a boy who is called David,"" he whispered to himself. ""Perhaps I should have done this thing long ago."" He was sorry the idea had not come into his mind in the days before his daughter Louise had been born and thought that surely now when he had erected a pile of burning sticks in some lonely place in the woods and had offered the body of a lamb as a burnt offering, God would appear to him and give him a message. More and more as he thought of the matter, he thought also of David and his passionate self-love was partially forgotten. ""It is time for the boy to begin thinking of going out into the world and the message will be one concerning him,"" he decided. ""God will make a pathway for him. He will tell me what place David is to take in life and when he shall set out on his journey. It is right that the boy should be there. If I am fortunate and an angel of God should appear, David will see the beauty and glory of God made manifest to man. It will make a true man of God of him also."" In silence Jesse and David drove along the road until they came to that place where Jesse had once before appealed to God and had frightened his grandson. The morning had been bright and cheer- ful, but a cold wind now began to blow and clouds hid the sun. When David saw the place to which they had come he began to tremble with fright, and when they stopped by the bridge where the creek came down from among the trees, he wanted to spring out of the phaeton and run away. A dozen plans for escape ran through David's head, but when Jesse stopped the horse and climbed over the fence into the wood, he followed. ""It is foolish to be afraid. Nothing will happen,"" he told himself as he went along with the lamb in his arms. There was something in the helplessness of the little animal held so tightly in his arms that gave him courage. He could feel the rapid beating of the beast's heart and that made his own heart beat less rapidly. As he walked swiftly along behind his grandfather, he untied the string with which the four legs of the lamb were fastened together. ""If anything happens we will run away together,"" he thought. In the woods, after they had gone a long way from the road, Jesse stopped in an opening among the trees where a clearing, overgrown with small bushes, ran up from the creek. He was still silent but began at once to erect a heap of dry sticks which he presently set afire. The boy sat on the ground with the lamb in his arms. His imagination began to invest every movement of the old man with signifi- cance and he became every moment more afraid. ""I must put the blood of the lamb on the head of the boy,"" Jesse muttered when the sticks had begun to blaze greedily, and taking a long knife from his pocket he turned and walked rapidly across the clearing toward David. Terror seized upon the soul of the boy. He was sick with it. For a moment he sat perfectly still and then his body stiffened and he sprang to his feet. His face became as white as the fleece of the lamb that, now finding itself suddenly released, ran down the hill. David ran also. Fear made his feet fly. Over the low bushes and logs he leaped frantically. As he ran he put his hand into his pocket and took out the branched stick from which the sling for shooting squirrels was suspended. When he came to the creek that was shallow and splashed down over the stones, he dashed into the water and turned to look back, and when he saw his grandfather still running toward him with the long knife held tightly in his hand he did not hesitate, but reaching down, se- lected a stone and put it in the sling. With all his strength he drew back the heavy rubber bands and the stone whistled through the air. It hit Jesse, who had entirely forgotten the boy and was pursuing the lamb, squarely in the head. With a groan he pitched forward and fell almost at the boy's feet. When David saw that he lay still and that he was appar- ently dead, his fright increased immeasurably. It be- came an insane panic. With a cry he turned and ran off through the woods weeping convulsively. ""I don't care--I killed him, but I don't care,"" he sobbed. As he ran on and on he decided suddenly that he would never go back again to the Bentley farms or to the town of Winesburg. ""I have killed the man of God and now I will myself be a man and go into the world,"" he said stoutly as he stopped running and walked rap- idly down a road that followed the windings of Wine Creek as it ran through fields and forests into the west. On the ground by the creek Jesse Bentley moved uneasily about. He groaned and opened his eyes. For a long time he lay perfectly still and looked at the sky. When at last he got to his feet, his mind was confused and he was not surprised by the boy's disappearance. By the roadside he sat down on a log and began to talk about God. That is all they ever got out of him. Whenever David's name was mentioned he looked vaguely at the sky and said that a messenger from God had taken the boy. ""It happened because I was too greedy for glory,"" he declared, and would have no more to say in the matter. "
Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 9-Part 1 Chapter 10,"  Next, the UM uses the analogy of the road to present his conclusion that man is afraid of completing his goal.  Man, he argues, loves the act of building, or constructing the road, but not the final product of the finished road.  It then follows that humans fear the law of determinism-that two and two makes four.  The UM dreads the prospect that humans will find this reason-this crystal palace, because then there will be nothing left for mankind to seek, nothing else for which to strive, nothing else for which to live. In this chapter, the Underground Man explains his refusal to accept the crystal palace, for the very reason that he wouldn't be able to stick his tongue out at it.  He would much rather live in his self-acclaimed underground. ",Notes from the Underground,Part 1 Chapter 9-Part 1 Chapter 10,"  Gentlemen, I am joking, and I know myself that my jokes are not brilliant,but you know one can take everything as a joke. I am, perhaps, jesting against the grain. Gentlemen, I am tormented by questions; answer them for me. You, for instance, want to cure men of their old habits and reform their will in accordance with science and good sense. But how do you know, not only that it is possible, but also that it is DESIRABLE to reform man in that way? And what leads you to the conclusion that man's inclinations NEED reforming? In short, how do you know that such a reformation will be a benefit to man? And to go to the root of the matter, why are you so positively convinced that not to act against his real normal interests guaranteed by the conclusions of reason and arithmetic is certainly always advantageous for man and must always be a law for mankind? So far, you know, this is only your supposition. It may be the law of logic, but not the law of humanity. You think, gentlemen, perhaps that I am mad? Allow me to defend myself. I agree that man is pre-eminently a creative animal, predestined to strive consciously for an object and to engage in engineering--that is, incessantly and eternally to make new roads, WHEREVER THEY MAY LEAD. But the reason why he wants sometimes to go off at a tangent may just be that he is PREDESTINED to make the road, and perhaps, too, that however stupid the ""direct"" practical man may be, the thought sometimes will occur to him that the road almost always does lead SOMEWHERE, and that the destination it leads to is less important than the process of making it, and that the chief thing is to save the well-conducted child from despising engineering, and so giving way to the fatal idleness, which, as we all know, is the mother of all the vices. Man likes to make roads and to create, that is a fact beyond dispute. But why has he such a passionate love for destruction and chaos also? Tell me that! But on that point I want to say a couple of words myself. May it not be that he loves chaos and destruction (there can be no disputing that he does sometimes love it) because he is instinctively afraid of attaining his object and completing the edifice he is constructing? Who knows, perhaps he only loves that edifice from a distance, and is by no means in love with it at close quarters; perhaps he only loves building it and does not want to live in it, but will leave it, when completed, for the use of LES ANIMAUX DOMESTIQUES--such as the ants, the sheep, and so on. Now the ants have quite a different taste. They have a marvellous edifice of that pattern which endures for ever--the ant-heap. With the ant-heap the respectable race of ants began and with the ant- heap they will probably end, which does the greatest credit to their perseverance and good sense. But man is a frivolous and incongruous creature, and perhaps, like a chess player, loves the process of the game, not the end of it. And who knows (there is no saying with certainty), perhaps the only goal on earth to which mankind is striving lies in this incessant process of attaining, in other words, in life itself, and not in the thing to be attained, which must always be expressed as a formula, as positive as twice two makes four, and such positiveness is not life, gentlemen, but is the beginning of death. Anyway, man has always been afraid of this mathematical certainty, and I am afraid of it now. Granted that man does nothing but seek that mathematical certainty, he traverses oceans, sacrifices his life in the quest, but to succeed, really to find it, dreads, I assure you. He feels that when he has found it there will be nothing for him to look for. When workmen have finished their work they do at least receive their pay, they go to the tavern, then they are taken to the police-station--and there is occupation for a week. But where can man go? Anyway, one can observe a certain awkwardness about him when he has attained such objects. He loves the process of attaining, but does not quite like to have attained, and that, of course, is very absurd. In fact, man is a comical creature; there seems to be a kind of jest in it all. But yet mathematical certainty is after all, something insufferable. Twice two makes four seems to me simply a piece of insolence. Twice two makes four is a pert coxcomb who stands with arms akimbo barring your path and spitting. I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too. And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the normal and the positive--in other words, only what is conducive to welfare--is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact. There is no need to appeal to universal history to prove that; only ask yourself, if you are a man and have lived at all. As far as my personal opinion is concerned, to care only for well-being seems to me positively ill-bred. Whether it's good or bad, it is sometimes very pleasant, too, to smash things. I hold no brief for suffering nor for well-being either. I am standing for ... my caprice, and for its being guaranteed to me when necessary. Suffering would be out of place in vaudevilles, for instance; I know that. In the ""Palace of Crystal"" it is unthinkable; suffering means doubt, negation, and what would be the good of a ""palace of crystal"" if there could be any doubt about it? And yet I think man will never renounce real suffering, that is, destruction and chaos. Why, suffering is the sole origin of consciousness. Though I did lay it down at the beginning that consciousness is the greatest misfortune for man, yet I know man prizes it and would not give it up for any satisfaction. Consciousness, for instance, is infinitely superior to twice two makes four. Once you have mathematical certainty there is nothing left to do or to understand. There will be nothing left but to bottle up your five senses and plunge into contemplation. While if you stick to consciousness, even though the same result is attained, you can at least flog yourself at times, and that will, at any rate, liven you up. Reactionary as it is, corporal punishment is better than nothing.  X  You believe in a palace of crystal that can never be destroyed--a palace at which one will not be able to put out one's tongue or make a long nose on the sly. And perhaps that is just why I am afraid of this edifice, that it is of crystal and can never be destroyed and that one cannot put one's tongue out at it even on the sly. You see, if it were not a palace, but a hen-house, I might creep into it to avoid getting wet, and yet I would not call the hen-house a palace out of gratitude to it for keeping me dry. You laugh and say that in such circumstances a hen-house is as good as a mansion. Yes, I answer, if one had to live simply to keep out of the rain. But what is to be done if I have taken it into my head that that is not the only object in life, and that if one must live one had better live in a mansion? That is my choice, my desire. You will only eradicate it when you have changed my preference. Well, do change it, allure me with something else, give me another ideal. But meanwhile I will not take a hen-house for a mansion. The palace of crystal may be an idle dream, it may be that it is inconsistent with the laws of nature and that I have invented it only through my own stupidity, through the old-fashioned irrational habits of my generation. But what does it matter to me that it is inconsistent? That makes no difference since it exists in my desires, or rather exists as long as my desires exist. Perhaps you are laughing again? Laugh away; I will put up with any mockery rather than pretend that I am satisfied when I am hungry. I know, anyway, that I will not be put off with a compromise, with a recurring zero, simply because it is consistent with the laws of nature and actually exists. I will not accept as the crown of my desires a block of buildings with tenements for the poor on a lease of a thousand years, and perhaps with a sign-board of a dentist hanging out. Destroy my desires, eradicate my ideals, show me something better, and I will follow you. You will say, perhaps, that it is not worth your trouble; but in that case I can give you the same answer. We are discussing things seriously; but if you won't deign to give me your attention, I will drop your acquaintance. I can retreat into my underground hole. But while I am alive and have desires I would rather my hand were withered off than bring one brick to such a building! Don't remind me that I have just rejected the palace of crystal for the sole reason that one cannot put out one's tongue at it. I did not say because I am so fond of putting my tongue out. Perhaps the thing I resented was, that of all your edifices there has not been one at which one could not put out one's tongue. On the contrary, I would let my tongue be cut off out of gratitude if things could be so arranged that I should lose all desire to put it out. It is not my fault that things cannot be so arranged, and that one must be satisfied with model flats. Then why am I made with such desires? Can I have been constructed simply in order to come to the conclusion that all my construction is a cheat? Can this be my whole purpose? I do not believe it. But do you know what: I am convinced that we underground folk ought to be kept on a curb. Though we may sit forty years underground without speaking, when we do come out into the light of day and break out we talk and talk and talk ....  "

The Count of Monte Cristo: Novel Summary: Chapter 21-25,"  After the celebration of one day in Rome, Albert is suddenly taken hostage by bandits- Luigi the Bandit and his gang of outlaws.  When Franz doesn't have the money to pay his friend's ransom, he seeks out the Count of Monte Cristo.  When the count hears of the news, he takes Franz with him into the catacombs and quickly settles the matter.  It seems that Luigi is a personal friend of the count.  The count, Franz and Albert walk out in peace. During this meeting, the priest learns that Mercedes has married Fernand, though she never loved him.  Danglars has grown very rich as an investment banker.  Learning that all of Dantes' other friends have betrayed him, the priest leaves Caderousse the diamond in its entirety.  Caderousse and his wife greedily accept the gift.     The count and his two new friends part company.  In exchange for the count's good will, Albert promises to be his host in Paris in a few months.  They arrange a time and a place where the count will meet them.  When the count (really Dantes of course) does come to Albert's home, he is met by a group of Albert's friends, including Maximilian, Morrel's son.  Soon the Count of Monte Cristo learns that Albert is planning to marry Danglars' daughter.  This fascinates the count, who plans to stay in Paris and buy a house for himself.    In this short chapter, Dantes learns that Albert's mother is Mercedes, his lover from the past.  When she meets the count, she turns pale, obviously recognizing him.  Dantes also seems to know who this woman is, since he too turns white.  The count goes to the house he is to buy with his servant, Bertuccio.  Soon Dantes learns that this house belongs to the father-in-law of Villefort.  Bertuccio becomes uneasy when they pass through the garden, recognizing the spot where he killed Villefort.  Quickly Bertuccio tells the story of how he avenged the death of his brother by murdering Villefort here in the garden.  Later, also due to one of Bertuccio's stories, Dantes learns that Mr. Caderousse indeed killed his wife and a jeweler in order to steal the diamond and the money the jeweler paid for it.  This is all very interesting to the Count of Monte Cristo.  Danglars and the count meet again after fourteen years.  The two talk business and the count impresses Danglars with his money.  Debray is introduced to the reader; he is a government official and personal friend of the Danglars family.  Eventually, through a confusing ordeal with Danglars' horses, the count has his servant, Ali, save Villefort's wife in a horse chase.  Villefort's wife seems very thankful to the count.  ",The Count of Monte Cristo,Chapter 21-25," The Cemetery of the Chateau D'If. On the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light that came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria's last winding-sheet, -- a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so little. Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between Dantes and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those wide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of death; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make his existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion, with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed. He seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into melancholy and gloomy revery. Alone -- he was alone again -- again condemned to silence -- again face to face with nothingness! Alone! -- never again to see the face, never again to hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! Was not Faria's fate the better, after all -- to solve the problem of life at its source, even at the risk of horrible suffering? The idea of suicide, which his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence, now hovered like a phantom over the abbe's dead body. ""If I could die,"" he said, ""I should go where he goes, and should assuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,"" he went on with a smile; ""I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens the door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me."" But excessive grief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave. Dantes recoiled from the idea of so infamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire for life and liberty. ""Die? oh, no,"" he exclaimed -- ""not die now, after having lived and suffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now to die would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I want to live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back the happiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not forget that I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who knows, some friends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I shall die in my dungeon like Faria."" As he said this, he became silent and gazed straight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing thought. Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain wore giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused abruptly by the bed. ""Just God!"" he muttered, ""whence comes this thought? Is it from thee? Since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take the place of the dead!"" Without giving himself time to reconsider his decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts to be distracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling shroud, opened it with the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse from the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it on his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his own, covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold brow, and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared horribly, turned the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might, when he brought the evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was his frequent custom; entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the wall, returned to the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle and thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside. He would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any mischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantes might have waited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed earlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed. Now his plans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If while he was being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantes did not intend to give them time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife, he meant to open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their alarm, escape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to better purpose. If they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would allow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the grave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped that the weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it. If he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he would be stifled, and then -- so much the better, all would be over. Dantes had not eaten since the preceding evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor did he think of it now. His situation was too precarious to allow him even time to reflect on any thought but one. The first risk that Dantes ran was, that the jailer, when he brought him his supper at seven o'clock, might perceive the change that had been made; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue, Dantes had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread and soup on the table, and went away without saying a word. This time the jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to Dantes, and seeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all. When seven o'clock came, Dantes' agony really began. His hand placed upon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the other he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time chills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp of ice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on without any unusual disturbance, and Dantes knew that he had escaped the first peril. It was a good augury. At length, about the hour the governor had appointed, footsteps were heard on the stairs. Edmond felt that the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held his breath, and would have been happy if at the same time he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins. The footsteps -- they were double -- paused at the door -- and Dantes guessed that the two grave-diggers had come to seek him -- this idea was soon converted into certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the hand-bier. The door opened, and a dim light reached Dantes' eyes through the coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed, a third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. The two men, approaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities. ""He's heavy though for an old and thin man,"" said one, as he raised the head. ""They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,"" said another, lifting the feet. ""Have you tied the knot?"" inquired the first speaker. ""What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?"" was the reply, ""I can do that when we get there."" ""Yes, you're right,"" replied the companion. ""What's the knot for?"" thought Dantes. They deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened himself in order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by the man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs. Suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantes knew that the mistral was blowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely mingled. The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting the bier down on the ground. One of them went away, and Dantes heard his shoes striking on the pavement. ""Where am I?"" he asked himself. ""Really, he is by no means a light load!"" said the other bearer, sitting on the edge of the hand-barrow. Dantes' first impulse was to escape, but fortunately he did not attempt it. ""Give us a light,"" said the other bearer, ""or I shall never find what I am looking for."" The man with the torch complied, although not asked in the most polite terms. ""What can he be looking for?"" thought Edmond. ""The spade, perhaps."" An exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found the object of his search. ""Here it is at last,"" he said, ""not without some trouble though."" ""Yes,"" was the answer, ""but it has lost nothing by waiting."" As he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was fastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence. ""Well, have you tied the knot?"" inquired the grave-digger, who was looking on. ""Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,"" was the answer. ""Move on, then."" And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded. They advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door, then went forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on which the chateau is built, reached Dantes' ear distinctly as they went forward. ""Bad weather!"" observed one of the bearers; ""not a pleasant night for a dip in the sea."" ""Why, yes, the abbe runs a chance of being wet,"" said the other; and then there was a burst of brutal laughter. Dantes did not comprehend the jest, but his hair stood erect on his head. ""Well, here we are at last,"" said one of them. ""A little farther -- a little farther,"" said the other. ""You know very well that the last was stopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the governor told us next day that we were careless fellows."" They ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantes felt that they took him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to and fro. ""One!"" said the grave-diggers, ""two! three!"" And at the same instant Dantes felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird, falling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood curdle. Although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent, it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century. At last, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the ice-cold water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a moment by his immersion beneath the waves. Dantes had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by a thirty-six pound shot tied to his feet. The sea is the cemetery of the Chateau d'If. The Island of Tiboulen. Dantes, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence of mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was for every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack, extricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts to free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still lower. He then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the cord that bound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually strangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud. Dantes waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid being seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and terrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose phantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed like arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a torch lighting two figures. He fancied that these two forms were looking at the sea; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry. Dantes dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water. This was an easy feat to him, for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up again the light had disappeared. He must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pomegue are the nearest islands of all those that surround the Chateau d'If, but Ratonneau and Pomegue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore the safest for Dantes' venture. The islands of Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Chateau d'If; Dantes, nevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his way in the darkness of the night? At this moment he saw the light of Planier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light on the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by turning to the left, Back to Full Books byAlexandre Dumas [Pere] therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said, it was at least a league from the Chateau d'If to this island. Often in prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive, ""Dantes, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned if you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion."" These words rang in Dantes' ears, even beneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity had taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy. Fear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantes' efforts. He listened for any sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness. He fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he redoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the chateau, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the terrible chateau had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it, but he felt its presence. An hour passed, during which Dantes, excited by the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves. ""Let us see,"" said he, ""I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that has retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close to Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?"" A shudder passed over him. He sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was too violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of recuperation. ""Well,"" said he, ""I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp seizes me, and then I shall sink;"" and he struck out with the energy of despair. Suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense, and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been shot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out his hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore. Before him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing so much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent combustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantes rose, advanced a few steps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on the granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the wind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion. At the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder. The tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves. Dantes had not been deceived -- he had reached the first of the two islands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and without shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to plunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but larger, and consequently better adapted for concealment. An overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury. Edmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves, dashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was safely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed to him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a vessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre of the storm. He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four-and-twenty hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock. As he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the Island of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant, Dantes saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power of winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with frightful rapidity. Dantes cried at the top of his voice to warn them of their danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four men clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung to the broken rudder. The men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to his ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it disappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird. At the same moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress. Dantes from his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark again. Dantes ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces; he listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing -- the cries had ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the wind abated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in the horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded their foaming crests with gold. It was day. Dantes stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if he now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity in the Chateau d'If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be witnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and land. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o'clock. The sea continued to get calmer. ""In two or three hours,"" thought Dantes, ""the turnkey will enter my chamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in vain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men who cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will be questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the wretched fugitive. The cannon will warn every one to refuse shelter to a man wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be on the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold, I am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. O my God, I have suffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable to do for myself."" As Dantes (his eyes turned in the direction of the Chateau d'If) uttered this prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomegue a small vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of prey; and with his sailor's eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan. She was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea rapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves. ""Oh,"" cried Edmond, ""to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being questioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles! What can I do? What story can I invent? under pretext of trading along the coast, these men, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to doing a good action. I must wait. But I cannot ---I am starving. In a few hours my strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been missed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last night. My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict me."" As he spoke, Dantes looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had been wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a point of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel's keel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantes' plan was formed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the timbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was taking. ""I am saved!"" murmured he. And this conviction restored his strength. He soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking between the Chateau d'If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he feared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea; but he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy, between the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne. However, the vessel and the swimmer insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks the tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him. He rose on the waves, making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the vessel stood on another tack. Dantes would have shouted, but he knew that the wind would drown his voice. It was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber, for without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the vessel -- certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in attracting attention. Dantes, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then he advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her course. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his cap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailers. This time he was both seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At the same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat. An instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards him. Dantes let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless, and swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his strength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was almost breathless. He shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of them cried in Italian, ""Courage!"" The word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength to surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface, struggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a third cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky turned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He felt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had fainted. When he opened his eyes Dantes found himself on the deck of the tartan. His first care was to see what course they were taking. They were rapidly leaving the Chateau d'If behind. Dantes was so exhausted that the exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh. As we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who had cried out ""Courage!"" held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while the third, an old sailer, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with that egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped yesterday, and which may overtake them to-morrow. A few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity. ""Who are you?"" said the pilot in bad French. ""I am,"" replied Dantes, in bad Italian, ""a Maltese sailor. We were coming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook us at Cape Morgion, and we were wrecked on these rocks."" ""Where do you come from?"" ""From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain and the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a piece of wreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my life, and I thank you,"" continued Dantes. ""I was lost when one of your sailors caught hold of my hair."" ""It was I,"" said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; ""and it was time, for you were sinking."" ""Yes,"" returned Dantes, holding out his hand, ""I thank you again."" ""I almost hesitated, though,"" replied the sailor; ""you looked more like a brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair a foot long."" Dantes recollected that his hair and beard had not been cut all the time he was at the Chateau d'If. ""Yes,"" said he, ""I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my hair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but to-day the vow expires."" ""Now what are we to do with you?"" said the captain. ""Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped; but I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be sure to find employment."" ""Do you know the Mediterranean?"" ""I have sailed over it since my childhood."" ""You know the best harbors?"" ""There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over my eyes."" ""I say, captain,"" said the sailor who had cried ""Courage!"" to Dantes, ""if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?"" ""If he says true,"" said the captain doubtingly. ""But in his present condition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it afterwards."" ""I will do more than I promise,"" said Dantes. ""We shall see,"" returned the other, smiling. ""Where are you going?"" asked Dantes. ""To Leghorn."" ""Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the wind?"" ""Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion."" ""You shall pass it by twenty fathoms."" ""Take the helm, and let us see what you know."" The young man took the helm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and seeing that, without being a first-rate sailer, she yet was tolerably obedient, -- ""To the sheets,"" said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew, obeyed, while the pilot looked on. ""Haul taut."" -- They obeyed. ""Belay."" This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantes had predicted, twenty fathoms to windward. ""Bravo!"" said the captain. ""Bravo!"" repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at this man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor they had not thought him capable of showing. ""You see,"" said Dantes, quitting the helm, ""I shall be of some use to you, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you can leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for my food and the clothes you lend me."" ""Ah,"" said the captain, ""we can agree very well, if you are reasonable."" ""Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,"" returned Dantes. ""That's not fair,"" said the seaman who had saved Dantes; ""for you know more than we do."" ""What is that to you, Jacopo?"" returned the Captain. ""Every one is free to ask what he pleases."" ""That's true,"" replied Jacopo; ""I only make a remark."" ""Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers, if you have them."" ""No,"" said Jacopo; ""but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers."" ""That is all I want,"" interrupted Dantes. Jacopo dived into the hold and soon returned with what Edmond wanted. ""Now, then, do you wish for anything else?"" said the patron. ""A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for I have not eaten or drunk for a long time."" He had not tasted food for forty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the gourd. ""Larboard your helm,"" cried the captain to the steersman. Dantes glanced that way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in mid-air. ""Hollo! what's the matter at the Chateau d'If?"" said the captain. A small white cloud, which had attracted Dantes' attention, crowned the summit of the bastion of the Chateau d'If. At the same moment the faint report of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another. ""What is this?"" asked the captain. ""A prisoner has escaped from the Chateau d'If, and they are firing the alarm gun,"" replied Dantes. The captain glanced at him, but he had lifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure, that suspicions, if the captain had any, died away. ""At any rate,"" murmured he, ""if it be, so much the better, for I have made a rare acquisition."" Under pretence of being fatigued, Dantes asked to take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the captain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade. Dantes could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles. ""What is the day of the month?"" asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside him. ""The 28th of February."" ""In what year?"" ""In what year -- you ask me in what year?"" ""Yes,"" replied the young man, ""I ask you in what year!"" ""You have forgotten then?"" ""I got such a fright last night,"" replied Dantes, smiling, ""that I have almost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?"" ""The year 1829,"" returned Jacopo. It was fourteen years day for day since Dantes' arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Chateau d'If; he was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his face; he asked himself what had become of Mercedes, who must believe him dead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three men who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed against Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon. This oath was no longer a vain menace; for the fastest sailer in the Mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to Leghorn. The Smugglers. Dantes had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of the men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the school of the Abbe Faria, the worthy master of The Young Amelia (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Provencal, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantes was on board a smuggler. At first the captain had received Dantes on board with a certain degree of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantes might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantes had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Chateau d'If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit. Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to ""pump"" him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe. In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian's portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work. When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a hand-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years' imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance. Dantes had entered the Chateau d'If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself. To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself: it was impossible that his best friend -- if, indeed, he had any friend left -- could recognize him; he could not recognize himself. The master of The Young Amelia, who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmond's value, had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next care on leaving the barber's who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor's suit -- a garb, as we all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantes; but Dantes, who had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time than three months. The Young Amelia had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France. They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the patron found Dantes leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo. The Young Amelia left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard, and kept on for Corsica. Dantes thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He must wait. Fortunately, Dantes had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches chimerical? -- offspring of the brain of the poor Abbe Faria, had they not died with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial, and Dantes repeated it to himself, from one end to the other, for he had not forgotten a word. Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own, for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing, for a ship's lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dantes noticed that the captain of The Young Amelia had, as he neared the land, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so. But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o'clock in the morning all the cargo was out of The Young Amelia and on terra firma. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of The Young Amelia, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres, or about eighty francs. But the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace what had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the first, The Young Amelia was in luck. This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines. There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of The Young Amelia. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dantes was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder. Dantes was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, ""Pain, thou art not an evil."" He had, moreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantes was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade. This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither was it so wicked as Dantes thought it, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall. Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly. As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position -- a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman. Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond, with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor Abbe Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds. And when Jacopo inquired of him, ""What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me?"" Edmond replied, ""Who knows? You may one day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte, became emperor."" We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican. Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there. He then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron of The Young Amelia ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own account -- for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres -- and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo. Then he would be free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at liberty, for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him. But in this world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain did he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship. Dantes was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del' Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already Dantes had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing all these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew. The patron of The Young Amelia proposed as a place of landing the Island of Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god of merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times have separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category. At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantes started with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn around the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were jumbled in a lingua franca. When he again joined the two persons who had been discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch at Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being consulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible security, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to get under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make the neutral island by the following day. The Island of Monte Cristo. Thus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which sometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an evil destiny, Dantes was about to secure the opportunity he wished for, by simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring any suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way. The night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions good and evil passed through Dantes' mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw Cardinal Spada's letter written on the wall in characters of flame -- if he slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He ascended into grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and the roof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as subterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck, filled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight, when be discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles. He then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had suddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the entrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the Arabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry it off. The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night had been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantes was then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for departure, and these preparations served to conceal Dantes' agitation. He had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was almost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear, distinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity and pleasure. The old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the superiority of Dantes over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man his natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that he might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven o'clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm, and, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a bright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights, each of which is a world. Dantes told them that all hands might turn in, and he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called Dantes) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks contentedly. This frequently happened. Dantes, cast from solitude into the world, frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and what solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship floating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in the silence of immensity, and under the eye of heaven? Now this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up by his illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When the patron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and every sail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an hour. The Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond resigned the lugger to the master's care, and went and lay down in his hammock; but, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a moment. Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about to double the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and beyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte Cristo reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky. Dantes ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La Pianosa to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by two or three knots. About five o'clock in the evening the island was distinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the sun cast at its setting. Edmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the variety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue; and from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist passed over his eyes. Never did gamester, whose whole fortune is staked on one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his paroxysms of hope. Night came, and at ten o'clock they anchored. The Young Amelia was first at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual command over himself, Dantes could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the first to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus, have ""kissed his mother earth."" It was dark, but at eleven o'clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered, and then, ""ascending high,"" played in floods of pale light on the rocky hills of this second Pelion. The island was familiar to the crew of The Young Amelia, -- it was one of her regular haunts. As to Dantes, he had passed it on his voyage to and from the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo. ""Where shall we pass the night?"" he inquired. ""Why, on board the tartan,"" replied the sailor. ""Should we not do better in the grottos?"" ""What grottos?"" ""Why, the grottos -- caves of the island."" ""I do not know of any grottos,"" replied Jacopo. The cold sweat sprang forth on Dantes' brow. ""What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?"" he asked. ""None."" For a moment Dantes was speechless; then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the sake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to discover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and Dantes therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides, a signal made half a league out at sea, and to which The Young Amelia replied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had come. The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that all was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and cast anchor within a cable's length of shore. Then the landing began. Dantes reflected, as he worked, on the shout of joy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he gave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart; but, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that he had already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual questions, his minute observations and evident pre-occupation, aroused suspicions. Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his painful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory. No one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a fowling-piece, powder, and shot, Dantes declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock, his wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for solitude. However, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dantes did not oppose this, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. Scarcely, however, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid, he begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook it, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This and some dried fruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of fare. Dantes went on, looking from time to time behind and around about him. Having reached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his companions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing the repast which Edmond's skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish. Edmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of a man superior to his fellows. ""In two hours' time,"" said he, ""these persons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and risk their lives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will return with a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs. At this moment hope makes me despise their riches, which seem to me contemptible. Yet perchance to-morrow deception will so act on me, that I shall, on compulsion, consider such a contemptible possession as the utmost happiness. Oh, no!"" exclaimed Edmond, ""that will not be. The wise, unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing. Besides, it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched life."" Thus Dantes, who but three months before had no desire but liberty had now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was not in Dantes, but in providence, who, while limiting the power of man, has filled him with boundless desires. Meanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn by a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never before trod, Dantes approached the spot where he supposed the grottos must have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest object with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain rocks, marks made by the hand of man. Time, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as it invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have respected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in order that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of a catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete. This solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man desirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have attracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the dark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret? It seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock, placed solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to lead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end of the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned round and retraced his steps. Meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from a spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at the moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they saw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock, and they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed his direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched his daring progress, Edmond's foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on the edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all loved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first. He found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little rum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened his eyes, complained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his head, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the shore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo's directions, he declared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved. It may be supposed that Dantes did not now think of his dinner, but he insisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should have their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of a little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The sailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious. An hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss-grown rock. But, instead of growing easier, Dantes' pains appeared to increase in violence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in order to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France, between Nice and Frejus, urged Dantes to try and rise. Edmond made great exertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning and turning pale. ""He has broken his ribs,"" said the commander, in a low voice. ""No matter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will try and carry him on board the tartan."" Dantes declared, however, that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him. ""Well,"" said the patron, ""let what may happen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you. We will not go till evening."" This very much astonished the sailors, although, not one opposed it. The patron was so strict that this was the first time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay in its execution. Dantes would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor. ""No, no,"" he said to the patron, ""I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of my clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and balls, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me."" ""But you'll die of hunger,"" said the patron. ""I would rather do so,"" was Edmond reply, ""than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me."" The patron turned towards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor, and, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet should be completed. ""What are we to do, Maltese?"" asked the captain. ""We cannot leave you here so, and yet we cannot stay."" ""Go, go!"" exclaimed Dantes. ""We shall be absent at least a week,"" said the patron, ""and then we must run out of our course to come here and take you up again."" ""Why,"" said Dantes, ""if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat, desire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my passage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me."" The patron shook his head. ""Listen, Captain Baldi; there's one way of settling this,"" said Jacopo. ""Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man."" ""And give up your share of the venture,"" said Edmond, ""to remain with me?"" ""Yes,"" said Jacopo, ""and without any hesitation."" ""You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,"" replied Edmond, ""and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do not wish any one to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up, and I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for bruises."" A peculiar smile passed over Dantes' lips; he squeezed Jacopo's hand warmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain -- and remain alone. The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set sail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making signs of a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand only, as if he could not move the rest of his body. Then, when they had disappeared, he said with a smile, -- ""'Tis strange that it should be among such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion."" Then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had a full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as gracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail. At the end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was impossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where he was. Then Dantes rose more agile and light than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his pickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the marks he had noted terminated. ""And now,"" he exclaimed, remembering the tale of the Arabian fisherman, which Faria had related to him, ""now, open sesame!""  "
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Novel Summary: Chapters 13-15," 5    Getting into the rowboat that the murderers themselves were planning to get away in, Huck and Jim hurriedly hurl themselves into the little boat and finally get away from the whole fiasco. They find their raft further downstream as they pass a ferryboat with a watchman on deck. Huck, wanting to help the ""rapscallions"" who he and Jim had stranded, tells this man that he is from the wrecked steamboat (ironically named the Walter Scott) and that his family is still on board. Later, Huck thinks to himself that the Widow Douglas would be quite proud of him for helping the men, since these are the kind, according to her, that most need helping.  Looking through the supplies they had received from the wreck, Huck and Jim talk about the adventures they've just had. Through the course of the conversation, Huck admits that Jim ""had an uncommon level head, for a nigger."" This shows that some of Huck's assumptions about Jim are beginning to change. Next, perhaps the most comical scene in the book takes place as Huck and Jim discuss the nature of kings and dukes. Huck, who has read more about them in his books, explains to Jim that kings don't do any work, but still get to have as much of anything as they want. Jim's knowledge of kings is limited to ""King Sollermun."" The two have a humorous conversation about him, and this leads into a discussion of languages, Jim not understanding the nature of different languages. This all serves to show Huck that Jim, though he may have an ""uncommon level head,"" is incredibly ignorant and stubborn.  Still planning on getting into the free states of the North, Jim and Huck continue their journey. Eventually the two get separated from each other, and Jim comes to believe that Huck has died. When Huck finds Jim a bit later, Jim is surprised but happy to see him again. ",The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Chapters 13-15,". WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted. Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that! But it warn't no time to be sentimentering. We'd GOT to find that boat now--had to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side, and slow work it was, too--seemed a week before we got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn't believe he could go any further--so scared he hadn't hardly any strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says: ""Heave that blame lantern out o' sight, Bill!"" He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set down. It was Packard. Then Bill HE come out and got in. Packard says, in a low voice: ""All ready--shove off!"" I couldn't hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But Bill says: ""Hold on--'d you go through him?"" ""No. Didn't you?"" ""No. So he's got his share o' the cash yet."" ""Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money."" ""Say, won't he suspicion what we're up to?"" ""Maybe he won't. But we got to have it anyway. Come along."" So they got out and went in. The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with my knife and cut the rope, and away we went! We didn't touch an oar, and we didn't speak nor whisper, nor hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it. When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was. Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men--I reckon I hadn't had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how would I like it? So says I to Jim: ""The first light we see we'll land a hundred yards below it or above it, in a place where it's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff, and then I'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can be hung when their time comes."" But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river, watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for it. It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward, with his head down between his knees. I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves, and begun to cry. He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says: ""Hello, what's up? Don't cry, bub. What's the trouble?"" I says: ""Pap, and mam, and sis, and--"" Then I broke down. He says: ""Oh, dang it now, DON'T take on so; we all has to have our troubles, and this 'n 'll come out all right. What's the matter with 'em?"" ""They're--they're--are you the watchman of the boat?"" ""Yes,"" he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. ""I'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand; and sometimes I'm the freight and passengers. I ain't as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can't be so blame' generous and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the way he does; but I've told him a many a time 't I wouldn't trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor's life's the life for me, and I'm derned if I'D live two mile out o' town, where there ain't nothing ever goin' on, not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I--"" I broke in and says: ""They're in an awful peck of trouble, and--"" ""WHO is?"" ""Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you'd take your ferryboat and go up there--"" ""Up where? Where are they?"" ""On the wreck."" ""What wreck?"" ""Why, there ain't but one."" ""What, you don't mean the Walter Scott?"" ""Yes."" ""Good land! what are they doin' THERE, for gracious sakes?"" ""Well, they didn't go there a-purpose."" ""I bet they didn't! Why, great goodness, there ain't no chance for 'em if they don't git off mighty quick! Why, how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape?"" ""Easy enough. Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town--"" ""Yes, Booth's Landing--go on."" ""She was a-visiting there at Booth's Landing, and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend's house, Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name--and they lost their steering-oar, and swung around and went a- floating down, stern first, about two mile, and saddle-baggsed on the wreck, and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost, but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck. Well, about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow, and it was so dark we didn't notice the wreck till we was right on it; and so WE saddle-baggsed; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple--and oh, he WAS the best cretur !--I most wish 't it had been me, I do."" ""My George! It's the beatenest thing I ever struck. And THEN what did you all do?"" ""Well, we hollered and took on, but it's so wide there we couldn't make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn't strike help sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he'd fix the thing. I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, 'What, in such a night and such a current? There ain't no sense in it; go for the steam ferry.' Now if you'll go and--"" ""By Jackson, I'd LIKE to, and, blame it, I don't know but I will; but who in the dingnation's a-going' to PAY for it? Do you reckon your pap--"" ""Why THAT'S all right. Miss Hooker she tole me, PARTICULAR, that her uncle Hornback--"" ""Great guns! is HE her uncle? Looky here, you break for that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and about a quarter of a mile out you'll come to the tavern; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback's, and he'll foot the bill. And don't you fool around any, because he'll want to know the news. Tell him I'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer."" I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some woodboats; for I couldn't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in. Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down! A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her. She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn't much chance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and hollered a little, but there wasn't any answer; all dead still. I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for I reckoned if they could stand it I could. Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker's remainders, because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river. It did seem a powerful long time before Jim's light showed up; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off. By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east; so we struck for an island, and hid the raft, and sunk the skiff, and turned in and slept like dead people. . BY and by, when we got up, we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck, and found boots, and blankets, and clothes, and all sorts of other things, and a lot of books, and a spyglass, and three boxes of seegars. We hadn't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he said he didn't want no more adventures. He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn't get saved he would get drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South, sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger. I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, 'stead of mister; and Jim's eyes bugged out, and he was interested. He says: ""I didn' know dey was so many un um. I hain't hearn 'bout none un um, skasely, but ole King Sollermun, onless you counts dem kings dat's in a pack er k'yards. How much do a king git?"" ""Get?"" I says; ""why, they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it; they can have just as much as they want; everything belongs to them."" ""AIN' dat gay? En what dey got to do, Huck?"" ""THEY don't do nothing! Why, how you talk! They just set around."" ""No; is dat so?"" ""Of course it is. They just set around--except, maybe, when there's a war; then they go to the war. But other times they just lazy around; or go hawking--just hawking and sp--Sh!--d' you hear a noise?"" We skipped out and looked; but it warn't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat's wheel away down, coming around the point; so we come back. ""Yes,"" says I, ""and other times, when things is dull, they fuss with the parlyment; and if everybody don't go just so he whacks their heads off. But mostly they hang round the harem."" ""Roun' de which?"" ""Harem."" ""What's de harem?"" ""The place where he keeps his wives. Don't you know about the harem? Solomon had one; he had about a million wives."" ""Why, yes, dat's so; I--I'd done forgot it. A harem's a bo'd'n-house, I reck'n. Mos' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery. En I reck'n de wives quarrels considable; en dat 'crease de racket. Yit dey say Sollermun de wises' man dat ever live'. I doan' take no stock in dat. Bekase why: would a wise man want to live in de mids' er sich a blim- blammin' all de time? No--'deed he wouldn't. A wise man 'ud take en buil' a biler-factry; en den he could shet DOWN de biler-factry when he want to res'."" ""Well, but he WAS the wisest man, anyway; because the widow she told me so, her own self."" ""I doan k'yer what de widder say, he WARN'T no wise man nuther. He had some er de dad-fetchedes' ways I ever see. Does you know 'bout dat chile dat he 'uz gwyne to chop in two?"" ""Yes, the widow told me all about it."" ""WELL, den! Warn' dat de beatenes' notion in de worl'? You jes' take en look at it a minute. Dah's de stump, dah--dat's one er de women; heah's you--dat's de yuther one; I's Sollermun; en dish yer dollar bill's de chile. Bofe un you claims it. What does I do? Does I shin aroun' mongs' de neighbors en fine out which un you de bill DO b'long to, en han' it over to de right one, all safe en soun', de way dat anybody dat had any gumption would? No; I take en whack de bill in TWO, en give half un it to you, en de yuther half to de yuther woman. Dat's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you: what's de use er dat half a bill?--can't buy noth'n wid it. En what use is a half a chile? I wouldn' give a dern for a million un um."" ""But hang it, Jim, you've clean missed the point--blame it, you've missed it a thousand mile."" ""Who? Me? Go 'long. Doan' talk to me 'bout yo' pints. I reck'n I knows sense when I sees it; en dey ain' no sense in sich doin's as dat. De 'spute warn't 'bout a half a chile, de 'spute was 'bout a whole chile; en de man dat think he kin settle a 'spute 'bout a whole chile wid a half a chile doan' know enough to come in out'n de rain. Doan' talk to me 'bout Sollermun, Huck, I knows him by de back."" ""But I tell you you don't get the point."" ""Blame de point! I reck'n I knows what I knows. En mine you, de REAL pint is down furder--it's down deeper. It lays in de way Sollermun was raised. You take a man dat's got on'y one or two chillen; is dat man gwyne to be waseful o' chillen? No, he ain't; he can't 'ford it. HE know how to value 'em. But you take a man dat's got 'bout five million chillen runnin' roun' de house, en it's diffunt. HE as soon chop a chile in two as a cat. Dey's plenty mo'. A chile er two, mo' er less, warn't no consekens to Sollermun, dad fatch him!"" I never see such a nigger. If he got a notion in his head once, there warn't no getting it out again. He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see. So I went to talking about other kings, and let Solomon slide. I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago; and about his little boy the dolphin, that would a been a king, but they took and shut him up in jail, and some say he died there. ""Po' little chap."" ""But some says he got out and got away, and come to America."" ""Dat's good! But he'll be pooty lonesome--dey ain' no kings here, is dey, Huck?"" ""No."" ""Den he cain't git no situation. What he gwyne to do?"" ""Well, I don't know. Some of them gets on the police, and some of them learns people how to talk French."" ""Why, Huck, doan' de French people talk de same way we does?"" ""NO, Jim; you couldn't understand a word they said--not a single word."" ""Well, now, I be ding-busted! How do dat come?""

Merry Wives of Windsor: Novel Summary: Act V Scene 1-5,"    Falstaff has agreed to go to the wood, hoping this will be third time lucky. Ford, disguised as Brook, enters, and Falstaff tells him to go to the forest at midnight. He tells Brook about his misadventure disguised as the old woman of Brainford, disparages Ford and promises vengeance on him, and promises that Brook will have Ford's wife. In scene 2, on the outskirts of Windsor forest, Page, Shallow and Slender rehearse their plans. Shallow tells Slender that he will recognize Anne by her white garments. In scene 3, Mrs. Page tells Caius that her daughter will be dressed in green, and that he should slip away with her whenever a moment presents itself. She knows her husband will be angry, but she thinks that is better than the heartbreak that would ensue if Anne is forced to marry Slender. Eagerly anticipating yet another humiliation of Falstaff, Mrs. Page and Mrs. Ford depart for Windsor Park. In scene 4, in the park, Evans leads the children disguised as fairies and tells them to remember their parts. In scene 5 Falstaff enters, wearing a buck's head, as he has been instructed. It is just after midnight. Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page enter, and Falstaff embraces Mrs. Ford. He is delighted to hear that Mrs. Page is there also. But then there is the sound of horns, and the women run away. Evans enters, dressed like a satyr (a mythical creature, half-man, half-beast), with Anne Page and the children, Pistol dressed as a hobgoblin, and Mistress Quickly dressed like the Queen of Fairies. Quickly and Pistol speak some rhymes addressed to the fairies. Falstaff, believing that anyone who speaks to fairies will die, lies face down and closes his eyes. Evans and Quickly recite more verses and then command the fairies to dance around the tree, next to which Falstaff lies. Spotting him, Evans commands the fairies to put their tapers to Falstaff's fingers. He gives a start, and the fairies then dance around him, pinch him and recite a scornful rhyme. While this is going on, Caius steals away with a boy in green; Slender with a boy in white (each thinks he has got Anne Page), while Fenton steals away with Anne. After a noise of hunting is made, the fairies run away. Page, Ford and their wives disclose themselves to Falstaff and mock him. He realizes that he has been made a fool of, but this does not stop their mockery. Falstaff resigns himself to enduring their insults. Page invites Falstaff to his house for dinner, where he will be able to laugh at Mrs. Page (who is now laughing at him), because she will have found out that her daughter has married Slender (or so Page thinks). In an aside, Mrs. Page discloses that Anne has in fact married Caius (or so she thinks). Then Slender enters, distressed. He tells how the person he thought was Anne Page turned out to be a boy. Page rebukes him for making a mess of their plan, but Slender explains that he followed it exactly. Mrs. Page tells her husband not to be angry, and explains that she put her daughter in green to foil his plan, and that Anne is now married to Caius. Caius enters, and tells a story just like Slender's. He eloped with a boy, thinking it was Anne. Fenton and Anne enter. They are married. Fenton rebukes her parents, saying that they wanted her to marry without love. He and Anne are now united and should not be accused of disobedience, since they married for love. Anne therefore avoided a forced, unhappy marriage. Page forgives them, and his wife follows his example. She invites everyone to their home where they can all laugh at what has happened. Falstaff is invited too, and Ford appears to be ready to forgive him his folly. Analysis In the final scene, the community of Windsor comes together and overcomes the threat embodied in Falstaff by exposing and ridiculing him. In doing so they reaffirm the moral and social order that governs their lives. Mrs. Page gives the moral of the play in Act 5, scene 3: ""Against such lewdsters and their lechery / Those that betray them do no treachery."" But anyone who knows the Henry IV plays will be disappointed to see the great wit and rogue Falstaff laid low in this manner. His abject submission, ""Use me as you will,"" and his comment, ""I am not able to answer,"" could not possibly have been uttered by the Falstaff of the Henry plays, who is never at a loss for words and can talk himself out of any situation. If Falstaff is thoroughly humiliated, the other characters do not emerge unscathed either. In the marriage plot concerning Anne Page, the deceivers are themselves deceived, and their materialistic values rebuked. The young lovers, Fenton and Anne, overcome the cold practicalities of middle age. Fenton is like Falstaff in the sense that he too transgressed the social order, since he had no permission to marry Anne, but he asks for and receives forgiveness. ",Merry Wives of Windsor,Act V Scene 1-5," The Garter Inn Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY  FALSTAFF. Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll, hold. This is the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd numbers. Away, go; they say there is divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away.  QUICKLY. I'll provide you a chain, and I'll do what I can to get you a pair of horns.  FALSTAFF. Away, I say; time wears; hold up your head, and mince.    Exit MRS. QUICKLY Enter FORD disguised How now, Master Brook. Master Brook, the matter will be known tonight or never. Be you in the Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall see wonders.  FORD. Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me you had appointed?  FALSTAFF. I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor old man; but I came from her, Master Brook, like a poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, Master Brook, that ever govern'd frenzy. I will tell you-he beat me grievously in the shape of a woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along with me; I'll. tell you all, Master Brook. Since I pluck'd geese, play'd truant, and whipp'd top, I knew not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow me. I'll tell you strange things of this knave-Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.   Exeunt SCENE 2. Windsor Park Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER  PAGE. Come, come; we'll couch i' th' Castle ditch till we see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, my daughter.  SLENDER. Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her, and we have a nay-word how to know one another. I come to her in white and cry 'mum'; she cries 'budget,' and by that we know one another.  SHALLOW. That's good too; but what needs either your mum or her budget? The white will decipher her well enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.  PAGE. The night is dark; light and spirits will become it well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns. Let's away; follow me.  Exeunt SCENE 3. A street leading to the Park Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS  MRS. PAGE. Master Doctor, my daughter is in green; when you see your time, take her by the hand, away with her to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before into the Park; we two must go together.  CAIUS. I know vat I have to do; adieu.  MRS. PAGE. Fare you well, sir. [Exit CAIUS] My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying my daughter; but 'tis no matter; better a little chiding than a great deal of heartbreak.  MRS. FORD. Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil, Hugh?  MRS. PAGE. They are all couch'd in a pit hard by Herne's oak, with obscur'd lights; which, at the very instant of Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once display to the night.  MRS. FORD. That cannot choose but amaze him.  MRS. PAGE. If he be not amaz'd, he will be mock'd; if he be amaz'd, he will every way be mock'd.  MRS. FORD. We'll betray him finely.  MRS. PAGE. Against such lewdsters and their lechery, Those that betray them do no treachery.  MRS. FORD. The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!    Exeunt SCENE 4. Windsor Park Enter SIR HUGH EVANS like a satyr, with OTHERS as fairies  EVANS. Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts. Be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and when I give the watch-ords, do as I pid you. Come, come; trib, trib.   Exeunt SCENE 5. Another part of the Park Enter FALSTAFF disguised as HERNE  FALSTAFF. The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute draws on. Now the hot-blooded gods assist me! Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love set on thy horns. O powerful love! that in some respects makes a beast a man; in some other a man a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan, for the love of Leda. O omnipotent love! how near the god drew to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in the form of a beast-O Jove, a beastly fault!-and then another fault in the semblance of a fowl- think on't, Jove, a foul fault! When gods have hot backs what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' th' forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my doe?   Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE MRS. FORD. Sir John! Art thou there, my deer, my male deer.  FALSTAFF. My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Greensleeves, hail kissing-comfits, and snow eringoes; let there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here. [Embracing her]  MRS. FORD. Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.  FALSTAFF. Divide me like a brib'd buck, each a haunch; I will keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands. Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the Hunter? Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!  [A noise of horns]  MRS. PAGE. Alas, what noise?  MRS. FORD. Heaven forgive our sins!  FALSTAFF. What should this be?  MRS. FORD. } Away, away.  MRS. PAGE. } Away, away. [They run off]  FALSTAFF. I think the devil will not have me damn'd, lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would never else cross me thus.   Enter SIR HUGH EVANS like a satyr, ANNE PAGE as  a fairy, and OTHERS as the Fairy Queen, fairies, and Hobgoblin; all with tapers  FAIRY QUEEN. Fairies, black, grey, green, and white, You moonshine revellers, and shades of night, You orphan heirs of fixed destiny, Attend your office and your quality. Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.  PUCK. Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys. Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap; Where fires thou find'st unrak'd, and hearths unswept, There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry; Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery.  FALSTAFF. They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die. I'll wink and couch; no man their works must eye.  [Lies down upon his face]  EVANS. Where's Pede? Go you, and where you find a maid That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said, Raise up the organs of her fantasy Sleep she as sound as careless infancy; But those as sleep and think not on their sins, Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides, and shins.  FAIRY QUEEN. About, about; Search Windsor castle, elves, within and out; Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room, That it may stand till the perpetual doom In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit, Worthy the owner and the owner it. The several chairs of order look you scour With juice of balm and every precious flower; Each fair instalment, coat, and sev'ral crest, With loyal blazon, evermore be blest! And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing, Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring; Th' expressure that it bears, green let it be, More fertile-fresh than all the field to see; And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write In em'rald tufts, flow'rs purple, blue and white; Like sapphire, pearl, and rich embroidery, Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee. Fairies use flow'rs for their charactery. Away, disperse; but till 'tis one o'clock, Our dance of custom round about the oak Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget.  EVANS. Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set; And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be, To guide our measure round about the tree. But, stay. I smell a man of middle earth.  FALSTAFF. Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he transform me to a piece of cheese!  PUCK. Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.  FAIRY QUEEN. With trial-fire touch me his finger-end; If he be chaste, the flame will back descend, And turn him to no pain; but if he start, It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.  PUCK. A trial, come.  EVANS. Come, will this wood take fire? [They put the tapers to his fingers, and he starts]  FALSTAFF. Oh, oh, oh!  FAIRY QUEEN. Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire! About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme; And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.  THE SONG. Fie on sinful fantasy! Fie on lust and luxury! Lust is but a bloody fire, Kindled with unchaste desire, Fed in heart, whose flames aspire, As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher. Pinch him, fairies, mutually; Pinch him for his villainy; Pinch him and burn him and turn him about, Till candles and star-light and moonshine be out.   During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR   CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a fairy in   green; SLENDER another way, and takes off a fairy in   white; and FENTON steals away ANNE PAGE. A noise   of hunting is heard within. All the fairies run away.   FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises   Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and  SIR HUGH EVANS  PAGE. Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now. Will none but Herne the Hunter serve your turn?  MRS. PAGE. I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher. Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives? See you these, husband? Do not these fair yokes Become the forest better than the town?  FORD. Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook, Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his horns, Master Brook; and, Master Brook, he hath enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for it, Master Brook.  MRS. FORD. Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet. I will never take you for my love again; but I will always count you my deer.  FALSTAFF. I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.  FORD. Ay, and an ox too; both the proofs are extant.  FALSTAFF. And these are not fairies? I was three or four times in the thought they were not fairies; and yet the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a receiv'd belief, in despite of the teeth of all rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent when 'tis upon ill employment.  EVANS. Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your desires, and fairies will not pinse you.  FORD. Well said, fairy Hugh.  EVANS. And leave you your jealousies too, I pray you.  FORD. I will never mistrust my wife again, till thou art able to woo her in good English.  FALSTAFF. Have I laid my brain in the sun, and dried it, that it wants matter to prevent so gross, o'er-reaching as this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? Shall I have a cox-comb of frieze? 'Tis time I were chok'd with a piece of toasted cheese.  EVANS. Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.  FALSTAFF. 'Seese' and 'putter'! Have I liv'd to stand at the taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking through the realm.  MRS. PAGE. Why, Sir John, do you think, though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders, and have given ourselves without scruple to hell, that ever the devil could have made you our delight?  FORD. What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?  MRS. PAGE. A puff'd man?  PAGE. Old, cold, wither'd, and of intolerable entrails?  FORD. And one that is as slanderous as Satan?  PAGE. And as poor as Job?  FORD. And as wicked as his wife?  EVANS. And given to fornications, and to taverns, and sack, and wine, and metheglins, and to drinkings, and swearings, and starings, pribbles and prabbles?  FALSTAFF. Well, I am your theme; you have the start of me; I am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me; use me as you will.  FORD. Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one Master Brook, that you have cozen'd of money, to whom you should have been a pander. Over and above that you have suffer'd, I think to repay that money will be a biting affliction.  PAGE. Yet be cheerful, knight; thou shalt eat a posset tonight at my house, where I will desire thee to laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee. Tell her Master Slender hath married her daughter.  MRS. PAGE. [Aside] Doctors doubt that; if Anne Page be my daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.  Enter SLENDER  SLENDER. Whoa, ho, ho, father Page!  PAGE. Son, how now! how now, son! Have you dispatch'd'?  SLENDER. Dispatch'd! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire know on't; would I were hang'd, la, else!  PAGE. Of what, son?  SLENDER. I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page, and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been i' th' church, I would have swing'd him, or he should have swing'd me. If I did not think it had been Anne Page, would I might never stir!-and 'tis a postmaster's boy.  PAGE. Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.  SLENDER. What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had him.  PAGE. Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how you should know my daughter by her garments?  SLENDER. I went to her in white and cried 'mum' and she cried 'budget' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.  MRS. PAGE. Good George, be not angry. I knew of your purpose; turn'd my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is now with the Doctor at the dean'ry, and there married.   Enter CAIUS  CAIUS. Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened; I ha' married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy; it is not Anne Page; by gar, I am cozened.  MRS. PAGE. Why, did you take her in green?  CAIUS. Ay, be gar, and 'tis a boy; be gar, I'll raise all Windsor.    Exit CAIUS  FORD. This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?  PAGE. My heart misgives me; here comes Master Fenton. Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE How now, Master Fenton!  ANNE. Pardon, good father. Good my mother, pardon.  PAGE. Now, Mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?  MRS. PAGE. Why went you not with Master Doctor, maid?  FENTON. You do amaze her. Hear the truth of it. You would have married her most shamefully, Where there was no proportion held in love. The truth is, she and I, long since contracted, Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us. Th' offence is holy that she hath committed; And this deceit loses the name of craft, Of disobedience, or unduteous title, Since therein she doth evitate and shun A thousand irreligious cursed hours, Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.  FORD. Stand not amaz'd; here is no remedy. In love, the heavens themselves do guide the state; Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.  FALSTAFF. I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to strike at me, that your arrow hath glanc'd.  PAGE. Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy! What cannot be eschew'd must be embrac'd.  FALSTAFF. When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chas'd.  MRS. PAGE. Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton, Heaven give you many, many merry days! Good husband, let us every one go home, And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire; Sir John and all.  FORD. Let it be so. Sir John, To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word; For he, to-night, shall lie with Mistress Ford.  Exeunt THE END < "
Oliver Twist: Novel Summary: Chapters34-36," Oliver was overjoyed at the news that she would recover, and was gathering flowers along the road for her sickroom when a post chaise came upon him.  The voice of Giles called out to him and asked him of news, and he told him that she would live.  A young gentleman then exited the coach and further questioned Oliver.  He instructed Giles to take the coach back to his mothers, because he felt like walking the rest of the way.  Harry Maylie had an affectionate meeting with his mother in which he expressed his desire to see Rose and give her his love.  The old woman tried to warn him against this talking vaguely about Rose's unbecoming past, but Harry did not care.  The evening was spent in joy, and the next day dawned as usual for Oliver except that Harry began going with him every morning to gather flowers.  Rose continued to recover, and Oliver continued hard at his studies.  One night while studying, Oliver fell asleep and had a bad dream about being back with the Jew.  He awoke startled to find that the very man of his dream was standing outside the window looking in on him with the man who had accosted him in the yard of the inn.  They recognized each other, and the Jew and his companion left, and Oliver screamed for help.   Oliver's cries brought Harry and Giles to him, and after he told them what happened, they set off to pursue the Jew and his companion.  Dr. Losberne joined them in the chase, but to no avail.  The next day they searched more but found nothing to indicate their presence.  They gave up the search and one afternoon Harry went to see Rose and profess his love to her.  Rose expressed to him that she did love him also but that she could not accept his offer because her name was stained and she would not bring that stain upon him.  Harry was devastated but said he would come to her again in a year to see if the circumstances then could changer her mind and if they did not, he promised to leave the situation alone forever.   Harry, Losberne, and Oliver sat at breakfast discussing the departure of the former two.  Losberne was headed to London, and Harry asked to escort him there.  Harry asked Oliver to write him every other Monday so that he could know what was happening with Rose and his mother.  Oliver was delighted that he could do something of importance and promises to keep the letters a secret.  Harry leaves and Rose watches him through the upstairs window, pretending to be happy, but very sad he is going.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Novel Summary: Chapters 16-18,"      Believing themselves to be close to freedom now, Huck begins to feel guilty for having helped Jim escape. Southern society has taught him that freeing a slave is a sin, and Huck starts to worry that he will go to hell. Being forced to postpone these thoughts for later, however, Huck is confronted by men who are looking for fugitive slaves. Wanting to search the raft for the slaves, the men begin to row out to it. Huck, however, ingeniously dissuades the men from such action by telling them that his father is onboard and has smallpox. Instead of helping, the men give Huck some money in charity. Later, now night, Huck and Jim jump overboard and are separated when a much larger vessel cuts their little raft into two pieces. Huck nearly drowns, but manages to reach shore, not having heard any sign of Jim.  Now on land, Huck walks a few paces before he hears a male voice yelling at him from a nearby house window. Apparently he has reached the Grangerford family headquarters. When asked who he is, Huck tells the man that his name is George Jackson and that he has just fallen off the steamboat. Taking him inside, the man examines Huck by candlelight, convinced that he isn't a Shepherdson, the name of the family with which the Grangerfords are feuding. The Grangerford family takes Huck in, and he admits that they were really nice. The ironic thing is, despite their obsession with feuding, the family seems to be very religious. Twain obviously uses this to further his indictment of religion.  Huck's education continues. He learns that the Grangerford family is practically part of the aristocracy. The other competing aristocracy in town seems to be the Shepherdsons. The families are feuding, Huck is told, because of some dispute that happened many years ago. When he asks what the nature of the dispute was, no one knows. All of this seems quite ridiculous to Huck. Soon word reaches the house that Miss Sophia, the beautiful daughter of the household, has run away to elope with a young man from the Shepherdson family. This immediately causes all the men of the house to fetch their guns and prepare for battle. Traveling with Buck, Huck himself sees the bloodshed first-hand. All of it, however, makes him sick to his stomach, especially when he sees Buck killed. Luckily, he meets Jim in the woods, and the two of them run back towards the river, away from the senseless feuding. ",The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Chapters 16-18,". WE slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There was a power of style about her. It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that. We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on both sides; you couldn't see a break in it hardly ever, or a light. We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it. I said likely we wouldn't, because I had heard say there warn't but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim--and me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we took a smoke on it and waited. There warn't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town, and not pass it without seeing it. He said he'd be mighty sure to see it, because he'd be a free man the minute he seen it, but if he missed it he'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says: ""Dah she is?"" But it warn't. It was Jack-o'-lanterns, or lightning bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most free--and who was to blame for it? Why, ME. I couldn't get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to troubling me so I couldn't rest; I couldn't stay still in one place. It hadn't ever come home to me before, what this thing was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn't to blame, because I didn't run Jim off from his rightful owner; but it warn't no use, conscience up and says, every time, ""But you knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody."" That was so--I couldn't get around that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me, ""What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why, she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. THAT'S what she done."" I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still. Every time he danced around and says, ""Dah's Cairo!"" it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness. Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children, and if their master wouldn't sell them, they'd get an Ab'litionist to go and steal them. It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according to the old saying, ""Give a nigger an inch and he'll take an ell."" Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children--children that belonged to a man I didn't even know; a man that hadn't ever done me no harm. I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, ""Let up on me--it ain't too late yet--I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell."" I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings out: ""We's safe, Huck, we's safe! Jump up and crack yo' heels! Dat's de good ole Cairo at las', I jis knows it!"" I says: ""I'll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn't be, you know."" He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says: ""Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n' for joy, en I'll say, it's all on accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn' ben for Huck; Huck done it. Jim won't ever forgit you, Huck; you's de bes' fren' Jim's ever had; en you's de ONLY fren' ole Jim's got now."" I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this, it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow then, and I warn't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I warn't. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says: ""Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on'y white genlman dat ever kep' his promise to ole Jim."" Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I GOT to do it--I can't get OUT of it. Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of them says: ""What's that yonder?"" ""A piece of a raft,"" I says. ""Do you belong on it?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Any men on it?"" ""Only one, sir."" ""Well, there's five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?"" I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn't come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says: ""He's white."" ""I reckon we'll go and see for ourselves."" ""I wish you would,"" says I, ""because it's pap that's there, and maybe you'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is. He's sick--and so is mam and Mary Ann."" ""Oh, the devil! we're in a hurry, boy. But I s'pose we've got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let's get along."" I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made a stroke or two, I says: ""Pap'll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can't do it by myself."" ""Well, that's infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy, what's the matter with your father?"" ""It's the--a--the--well, it ain't anything much."" They stopped pulling. It warn't but a mighty little ways to the raft now. One says: ""Boy, that's a lie. What IS the matter with your pap? Answer up square now, and it'll be the better for you."" ""I will, sir, I will, honest--but don't leave us, please. It's the--the --Gentlemen, if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won't have to come a-near the raft--please do."" ""Set her back, John, set her back!"" says one. They backed water. ""Keep away, boy--keep to looard. Confound it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap's got the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn't you come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?"" ""Well,"" says I, a-blubbering, ""I've told everybody before, and they just went away and left us."" ""Poor devil, there's something in that. We are right down sorry for you, but we--well, hang it, we don't want the small-pox, you see. Look here, I'll tell you what to do. Don't you try to land by yourself, or you'll smash everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and you'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don't be a fool again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we're trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that's a good boy. It wouldn't do any good to land yonder where the light is--it's only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father's poor, and I'm bound to say he's in pretty hard luck. Here, I'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom! it won't do to fool with small-pox, don't you see?"" ""Hold on, Parker,"" says the other man, ""here's a twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr. Parker told you, and you'll be all right."" ""That's so, my boy--good-bye, good-bye. If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money by it."" ""Good-bye, sir,"" says I; ""I won't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it."" They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn't no use for me to try to learn to do right; a body that don't get STARTED right when he's little ain't got no show--when the pinch comes there ain't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work, and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to myself, hold on; s'pose you'd a done right and give Jim up, would you felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I'd feel bad--I'd feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what's the use you learning to do right when it's troublesome to do right and ain't no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same? I was stuck. I couldn't answer that. So I reckoned I wouldn't bother no more about it, but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time. I went into the wigwam; Jim warn't there. I looked all around; he warn't anywhere. I says: ""Jim!"" ""Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o' sight yit? Don't talk loud."" He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says: ""I was a-listenin' to all de talk, en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho' if dey come aboard. Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf' agin when dey was gone. But lawsy, how you did fool 'em, Huck! Dat WUZ de smartes' dodge! I tell you, chile, I'spec it save' ole Jim--ole Jim ain't going to forgit you for dat, honey."" Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there. Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and getting all ready to quit rafting. That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend. I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and says: ""Mister, is that town Cairo?"" ""Cairo? no. You must be a blame' fool."" ""What town is it, mister?"" ""If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here botherin' around me for about a half a minute longer you'll get something you won't want."" I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned. We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it was high ground, so I didn't go. No high ground about Cairo, Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion something. So did Jim. I says: ""Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night."" He says: ""Doan' le's talk about it, Huck. Po' niggers can't have no luck. I awluz 'spected dat rattlesnake-skin warn't done wid its work."" ""I wish I'd never seen that snake-skin, Jim--I do wish I'd never laid eyes on it."" ""It ain't yo' fault, Huck; you didn' know. Don't you blame yo'self 'bout it."" When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo. We talked it all over. It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn't no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone! We didn't say a word for a good while. There warn't anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still. By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in. We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after us. So we shoved out after dark on the raft. Anybody that don't believe yet that it's foolishness to handle a snake- skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us. The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we didn't see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours and more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next meanest thing to fog. You can't tell the shape of the river, and you can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river. We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks he's mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steam--and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight through the raft. I dived--and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I could hear her. I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was ""treading water,"" and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way. It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big old- fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg. . IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out, and says: ""Be done, boys! Who's there?"" I says: ""It's me."" ""Who's me?"" ""George Jackson, sir."" ""What do you want?"" ""I don't want nothing, sir. I only want to go along by, but the dogs won't let me."" ""What are you prowling around here this time of night for--hey?"" ""I warn't prowling around, sir, I fell overboard off of the steamboat."" ""Oh, you did, did you? Strike a light there, somebody. What did you say your name was?"" ""George Jackson, sir. I'm only a boy."" ""Look here, if you're telling the truth you needn't be afraid--nobody'll hurt you. But don't try to budge; stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?"" ""No, sir, nobody."" I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The man sung out: ""Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool--ain't you got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door. Bob, if you and Tom are ready, take your places."" ""All ready."" ""Now, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?"" ""No, sir; I never heard of them."" ""Well, that may be so, and it mayn't. Now, all ready. Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don't you hurry--come mighty slow. If there's anybody with you, let him keep back--if he shows himself he'll be shot. Come along now. Come slow; push the door open yourself--just enough to squeeze in, d' you hear?"" I didn't hurry; I couldn't if I'd a wanted to. I took one slow step at a time and there warn't a sound, only I thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans, but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said, ""There, that's enough--put your head in."" I done it, but I judged they would take it off. The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about sixty, the other two thirty or more--all of them fine and handsome --and the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I couldn't see right well. The old gentleman says: ""There; I reckon it's all right. Come in."" As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows-- there warn't none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good look at me, and all said, ""Why, HE ain't a Shepherdson--no, there ain't any Shepherdson about him."" Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being searched for arms, because he didn't mean no harm by it--it was only to make sure. So he didn't pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands, and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says: ""Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing's as wet as he can be; and don't you reckon it may be he's hungry?"" ""True for you, Rachel--I forgot."" So the old lady says: ""Betsy"" (this was a nigger woman), ""you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him--oh, here he is himself. Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that's dry."" Buck looked about as old as me--thirteen or fourteen or along there, though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn't on anything but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the other one. He says: ""Ain't they no Shepherdsons around?"" They said, no, 'twas a false alarm. ""Well,"" he says, ""if they'd a ben some, I reckon I'd a got one."" They all laughed, and Bob says: ""Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you've been so slow in coming."" ""Well, nobody come after me, and it ain't right I'm always kept down; I don't get no show."" ""Never mind, Buck, my boy,"" says the old man, ""you'll have show enough, all in good time, don't you fret about that. Go 'long with you now, and do as your mother told you."" When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out. I said I didn't know; I hadn't heard about it before, no way. ""Well, guess,"" he says. ""How'm I going to guess,"" says I, ""when I never heard tell of it before?"" ""But you can guess, can't you? It's just as easy."" ""WHICH candle?"" I says. ""Why, any candle,"" he says. ""I don't know where he was,"" says I; ""where was he?"" ""Why, he was in the DARK! That's where he was!"" ""Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?"" ""Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times--they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a dog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I'd better put 'em on, but I'd ruther not, it's so warm. Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss."" Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk--that is what they had for me down there, and there ain't nothing better that ever I've come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs. They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more, and Bill went to hunt them and he warn't heard of no more, and Tom and Mort died, and then there warn't nobody but just me and pap left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles; so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn't belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard; and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says: ""Can you spell, Buck?"" ""Yes,"" he says. ""I bet you can't spell my name,"" says I. ""I bet you what you dare I can,"" says he. ""All right,"" says I, ""go ahead."" ""G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n--there now,"" he says. ""Well,"" says I, ""you done it, but I didn't think you could. It ain't no slouch of a name to spell--right off without studying."" I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it. It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style. It didn't have an iron latch on the front door, nor a wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as houses in town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn't took any money for her. Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath. This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a man that left his family, it didn't say why. I read considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but tough. Another was Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't read the poetry. Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead. There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too--not bagged down in the middle and busted, like an old basket. They had pictures hung on the walls--mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called ""Signing the Declaration."" There was some that they called crayons, which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see before-- blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule, and underneath the picture it said ""Shall I Never See Thee More Alas."" Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath the picture it said ""I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas."" There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and underneath the picture it said ""And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas."" These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up towards the moon--and the idea was to see which pair would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me. This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded: ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC'D And did young Stephen sicken, And did young Stephen die? And did the sad hearts thicken, And did the mourners cry? No; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots; Though sad hearts round him thickened, 'Twas not from sickness' shots. No whooping-cough did rack his frame, Nor measles drear with spots; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots. Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots, Nor stomach troubles laid him low, Young Stephen Dowling Bots. O no. Then list with tearful eye, Whilst I his fate do tell. His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well. They got him out and emptied him; Alas it was too late; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great. If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen, there ain't no telling what she could a done by and by. Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn't ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and if she couldn't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn't particular; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died, she would be on hand with her ""tribute"" before he was cold. She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker--the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person's name, which was Whistler. She warn't ever the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and did not live long. Poor thing, many's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between us. Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline's room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly. Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing ""The Last Link is Broken"" and play ""The Battle of Prague"" on it. The walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors, and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.  Back to Full Books byMark Twain (Samuel Clemens) It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day, and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn't be better. And warn't the cooking good, and just bushels of it too! "
"Crime and Punishment: Novel Summary: Part2, Chapter 2-Part2, Chapter 3","   Part2,  He hides the stolen items beneath a rock in a vacant lot. When he realizes that he has successfully hidden them, another wave of joy passes through him, but it is soon replaced with hopelessness and disgust for everything around him. He finds himself at his friend Razumikhin's apartment and enters in a state of near-delirium. He realizes, after a feeble attempt to converse, that there is no one in the whole wide world he could effectively meet at this moment face to face. He rejects Razumikhin's efforts to provide him with some lessons for pay and leaves. Raskolnikov then wanders through the streets and at one point is given some money by someone mistaking him for a poor beggar (his clothes are rags). He then returns home and dreams that one of the policeman is beating the landlady. Part2,  After days spent in fevered delirium and illness, Raskolnikov awakes to discover Nastasia and a tradesman, whom he does not know, at his bedside. Razumikhin, who has been caring for him, enters the room. The tradesman presents him with thirty-five rubles which his mother has sent. Razumikhin takes some of the money and goes to buy new clothes for Raskolnikov. In the meantime, Razumikhin has also succeeded in currying the landlady's favor, a feat which he declares required little effort. The chapter ends with the entrance of Zosimov. ",Crime and Punishment,"Part2, Chapter 2-Part2, Chapter 3"," ""And what if there has been a search already? What if I find them in my room?"" But here was his room. Nothing and no one in it. No one had peeped in. Even Nastasya had not touched it. But heavens! how could he have left all those things in the hole? He rushed to the corner, slipped his hand under the paper, pulled the things out and lined his pockets with them. There were eight articles in all: two little boxes with ear-rings or something of the sort, he hardly looked to see; then four small leather cases. There was a chain, too, merely wrapped in newspaper and something else in newspaper, that looked like a decoration. . . . He put them all in the different pockets of his overcoat, and the remaining pocket of his trousers, trying to conceal them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of his room, leaving the door open. He walked quickly and resolutely, and though he felt shattered, he had his senses about him. He was afraid of pursuit, he was afraid that in another half-hour, another quarter of an hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at all costs, he must hide all traces before then. He must clear everything up while he still had some strength, some reasoning power left him. . . . Where was he to go? That had long been settled: ""Fling them into the canal, and all traces hidden in the water, the thing would be at an end."" So he had decided in the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps' edge, and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would. Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if they had nothing to do but to watch him. ""Why is it, or can it be my fancy?"" he thought. At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed, and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half- hour, worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste. He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way another idea struck him. ""Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot perhaps?"" And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed, apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It was probably a carriage builder's or carpenter's shed; the whole place from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, ""Standing here strictly forbidden."" This was all the better, for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in. ""Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!"" Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste. He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands, and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it. The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot. Nothing could be noticed. Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense, almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in the police-office. ""I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!"" And he laughed. Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had given the twenty copecks: ""Damn him!"" He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months. ""Damn it all!"" he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury. ""If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how stupid it is! . . . And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It is not that at all!"" Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple question perplexed and bitterly confounded him. ""If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even glance into the purse and don't know what I had there, for which I have undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base, filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen either . . . how's that?"" Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though it could not possibly be otherwise. . . . Yes, he had known it all, and understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out of it. . . . Yes, so it was. ""It is because I am very ill,"" he decided grimly at last, ""I have been worrying and fretting myself, and I don't know what I am doing. . . . Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been worrying myself. . . . I shall get well and I shall not worry. . . . But what if I don't get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!"" He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred. All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he might have spat at him or bitten him. . . . He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. ""Why, he lives here, in that house,"" he thought, ""why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here it's the same thing over again. . . . Very interesting to know, though; have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the day /after/; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further now."" He went up to Razumihin's room on the fifth floor. The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise. ""Is it you?"" he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a brief pause, he whistled. ""As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you've cut me out!"" he added, looking at Raskolnikov's rags. ""Come sit down, you are tired, I'll be bound."" And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his visitor was ill. ""Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?"" He began feeling his pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand. ""Never mind,"" he said, ""I have come for this: I have no lessons. . . . I wanted, . . . but I don't really want lessons. . . ."" ""But I say! You are delirious, you know!"" Razumihin observed, watching him carefully. ""No, I am not."" Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to Razumihin's, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin's threshold. ""Good-bye,"" he said abruptly, and walked to the door. ""Stop, stop! You queer fish."" ""I don't want to,"" said the other, again pulling away his hand. ""Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this is . . . almost insulting! I won't let you go like that."" ""Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could help . . . to begin . . . because you are kinder than anyone-- cleverer, I mean, and can judge . . . and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear? Nothing at all . . . no one's services . . . no one's sympathy. I am by myself . . . alone. Come, that's enough. Leave me alone."" ""Stay a minute, you sweep! You are a perfect madman. As you like for all I care. I have no lessons, do you see, and I don't care about that, but there's a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson. I would not exchange him for five lessons. He's doing publishing of a kind, and issuing natural science manuals and what a circulation they have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am! Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses the question, 'Is woman a human being?' And, of course, triumphantly proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job, and I've had six already in advance. When we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of /Les Confessions/ we have marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don't contradict him, hang him! Well, would you like to do the second signature of '/Is woman a human being?/' If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share. And when you have finished the signature there will be another three roubles for you. And please don't think I am doing you a service; quite the contrary, as soon as you came in, I saw how you could help me; to begin with, I am weak in spelling, and secondly, I am sometimes utterly adrift in German, so that I make it up as I go along for the most part. The only comfort is, that it's bound to be a change for the better. Though who can tell, maybe it's sometimes for the worse. Will you take it?"" Raskolnikov took the German sheets in silence, took the three roubles and without a word went out. Razumihin gazed after him in astonishment. But when Raskolnikov was in the next street, he turned back, mounted the stairs to Razumihin's again and laying on the table the German article and the three roubles, went out again, still without uttering a word. ""Are you raving, or what?"" Razumihin shouted, roused to fury at last. ""What farce is this? You'll drive me crazy too . . . what did you come to see me for, damn you?"" ""I don't want . . . translation,"" muttered Raskolnikov from the stairs. ""Then what the devil do you want?"" shouted Razumihin from above. Raskolnikov continued descending the staircase in silence. ""Hey, there! Where are you living?"" No answer. ""Well, confound you then!"" But Raskolnikov was already stepping into the street. On the Nikolaevsky Bridge he was roused to full consciousness again by an unpleasant incident. A coachman, after shouting at him two or three times, gave him a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under his horses' hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle of the bridge in the traffic). He angrily clenched and ground his teeth. He heard laughter, of course. ""Serves him right!"" ""A pickpocket I dare say."" ""Pretending to be drunk, for sure, and getting under the wheels on purpose; and you have to answer for him."" ""It's a regular profession, that's what it is."" But while he stood at the railing, still looking angry and bewildered after the retreating carriage, and rubbing his back, he suddenly felt someone thrust money into his hand. He looked. It was an elderly woman in a kerchief and goatskin shoes, with a girl, probably her daughter wearing a hat, and carrying a green parasol. ""Take it, my good man, in Christ's name."" He took it and they passed on. It was a piece of twenty copecks. From his dress and appearance they might well have taken him for a beggar asking alms in the streets, and the gift of the twenty copecks he doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him. He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished. The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot, gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before, as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him . . . so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories, his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all. . . . He felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment. Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember. Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion. . . . It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears, blows and curses he had never heard. He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch. Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her, banging her head against the steps--that's clear, that can be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors banging. ""But why, why, and how could it be?"" he repeated, thinking seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And they would come to him then next, ""for no doubt . . . it's all about that . . . about yesterday. . . . Good God!"" He would have fastened his door with the latch, but he could not lift his hand . . . besides, it would be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed him. . . . But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes, began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses. . . . But at last he, too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. ""Can he have gone away? Good Lord!"" Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still weeping and moaning . . . and then her door slammed. . . . Now the crowd was going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates of the block. ""But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come here!"" Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon. ""You've eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You've been trudging about all day, and you're shaking with fever."" ""Nastasya . . . what were they beating the landlady for?"" She looked intently at him. ""Who beat the landlady?"" ""Just now . . . half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant superintendent, on the stairs. . . . Why was he ill-treating her like that, and . . . why was he here?"" Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes. ""Nastasya, why don't you speak?"" he said timidly at last in a weak voice. ""It's the blood,"" she answered at last softly, as though speaking to herself. ""Blood? What blood?"" he muttered, growing white and turning towards the wall. Nastasya still looked at him without speaking. ""Nobody has been beating the landlady,"" she declared at last in a firm, resolute voice. He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe. ""I heard it myself. . . . I was not asleep . . . I was sitting up,"" he said still more timidly. ""I listened a long while. The assistant superintendent came. . . . Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the flats."" ""No one has been here. That's the blood crying in your ears. When there's no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying things. . . . Will you eat something?"" He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him. ""Give me something to drink . . . Nastasya."" She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water. He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.  "

Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised?  ORLANDO. I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not: As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.   Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE  ROSALIND. Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg'd: You say, if I bring in your Rosalind, You will bestow her on Orlando here?  DUKE SENIOR. That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.  ROSALIND. And you say you will have her when I bring her?  ORLANDO. That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.  ROSALIND. You say you'll marry me, if I be willing?  PHEBE. That will I, should I die the hour after.  ROSALIND. But if you do refuse to marry me, You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?  PHEBE. So is the bargain.  ROSALIND. You say that you'll have Phebe, if she will?  SILVIUS. Though to have her and death were both one thing.  ROSALIND. I have promis'd to make all this matter even. Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter; You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter; Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me, Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd; Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her If she refuse me; and from hence I go, To make these doubts all even.  Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA  DUKE SENIOR. I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.  ORLANDO. My lord, the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter. But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born, And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle, Whom he reports to be a great magician, Obscured in the circle of this forest.  Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY  JAQUES. There is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are call'd fools.  TOUCHSTONE. Salutation and greeting to you all!  JAQUES. Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.  TOUCHSTONE. If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flatt'red a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.  JAQUES. And how was that ta'en up?  TOUCHSTONE. Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.  JAQUES. How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.  DUKE SENIOR. I like him very well.  TOUCHSTONE. God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.  DUKE SENIOR. By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.  TOUCHSTONE. According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.  JAQUES. But, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?  TOUCHSTONE. Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more seeming, Audrey- as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier's beard; he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was. This is call'd the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself. This is call'd the Quip Modest. If again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment. This is call'd the Reply Churlish. If again it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true. This is call'd the Reproof Valiant. If again it was not well cut, he would say I lie. This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome. And so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.  JAQUES. And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?  TOUCHSTONE. I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur'd swords and parted.  JAQUES. Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?  TOUCHSTONE. O, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel; but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as: 'If you  said so, then I said so.' And they shook hands, and swore brothers. Your If is the only peace-maker; much virtue in If.  JAQUES. Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He's as good at any thing, and yet a fool.  DUKE SENIOR. He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.  Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA. Still MUSIC HYMEN.  Then is there mirth in heaven, When earthly things made even   Atone together. Good Duke, receive thy daughter; Hymen from heaven brought her,   Yea, brought her hither, That thou mightst join her hand with his, Whose heart within his bosom is.  ROSALIND. [To DUKE] To you I give myself, for I am yours. [To ORLANDO] To you I give myself, for I am yours.  DUKE SENIOR. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.  ORLANDO. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.  PHEBE. If sight and shape be true, Why then, my love adieu!  ROSALIND. I'll have no father, if you be not he; I'll have no husband, if you be not he; Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.  HYMEN.  Peace, ho! I bar confusion;   'Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange events.   Here's eight that must take hands   To join in Hymen's bands, If truth holds true contents.   You and you no cross shall part;   You and you are heart in heart;   You to his love must accord,   Or have a woman to your lord;   You and you are sure together,   As the winter to foul weather.   Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,   Feed yourselves with questioning,   That reason wonder may diminish,   How thus we met, and these things finish.  SONG   Wedding is great Juno's crown; O blessed bond of board and bed!   'Tis Hymen peoples every town; High wedlock then be honoured.   Honour, high honour, and renown,   To Hymen, god of every town!  DUKE SENIOR. O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me! Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.  PHEBE. I will not eat my word, now thou art mine; Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine. Enter JAQUES de BOYS  JAQUES de BOYS. Let me have audience for a word or two. I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly. Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot, In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here, and put him to the sword; And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where, meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world; His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother, And all their lands restor'd to them again That were with him exil'd. This to be true I do engage my life.  DUKE SENIOR. Welcome, young man. Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding: To one, his lands withheld; and to the other, A land itself at large, a potent dukedom. First, in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot; And after, every of this happy number, That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us, Shall share the good of our returned fortune, According to the measure of their states. Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity, And fall into our rustic revelry. Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all, With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.  JAQUES. Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly, The Duke hath put on a religious life, And thrown into neglect the pompous court.  JAQUES DE BOYS. He hath.  JAQUES. To him will I. Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn'd. [To DUKE] You to your former honour I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it. [To ORLANDO] You to a love that your true faith doth merit; [To OLIVER] You to your land, and love, and great allies [To SILVIUS] You to a long and well-deserved bed; [To TOUCHSTONE] And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures; I am for other than for dancing measures.  DUKE SENIOR. Stay, Jaques, stay.  JAQUES. To see no pastime I. What you would have I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave. Exit  DUKE SENIOR. Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites, As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.  [A dance] Exeunt "
Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 2 Chapter 6-Part 2 Chapter 7," Realizing that he's been in a semi-conscious state (we can assume that this is after he and the woman have made love) for some time now, the UM comes to, noticing that the woman, Liza, has been staring at him.  They have a rather cold, unsociable conversation, and the UM finds out who she is and where she has come from.  It turns out the girl has had a very hard life and has moved to this house recently to earn some money. The UM is fascinated by her, however, and tries to philosophize to her, rebuking her for making herself into a slave and imploring her to give up the loathsome profession and get married.  Soon he also tells about himself and how he didn't have a family growing up.  This, he says, is why he has become ""so unfeeling."" Eventually he even launches into one of his underground speeches, telling her about selfless love.  Afterward, she crushes him with the sarcastic comment that he sounds ""just like a book."" Their conversation continues, and the UM remains very serious with her.  Indeed the whole tone of the Notes has shifted dramatically, becoming much more catastrophic and heartbreaking.  He begins detailing what it will be like when she dies, on old, wretched woman not loved by anyone.  He tells her, ""That'll be the end of your memory on earth; for other women, children will visit their graves, fathers, husbands-but for you-no tears, no sighs; no remembrances."" Over the course of the whole conversation, the UM maintains a very pompous, superior tone over this woman.  As in his ""beautiful and sublime"" dreams, he has become the hero before her, the one with all the answers.  Unfortunately, if she ever comes to visit him (since he gave her his address), she will realize that in reality, he is nothing more than a spec of dirt.  This haunts the UM to no end. ",Notes from the Underground,Part 2 Chapter 6-Part 2 Chapter 7,"O and Lermontov's MASQUERADE. And all at once I felt horribly ashamed, so ashamed that I stopped the horse, got out of the sledge, and stood still in the snow in the middle of the street. The driver gazed at me, sighing and astonished. What was I to do? I could not go on there--it was evidently stupid, and I could not leave things as they were, because that would seem as though ... Heavens, how could I leave things! And after such insults! ""No!"" I cried, throwing myself into the sledge again. ""It is ordained! It is fate! Drive on, drive on!"" And in my impatience I punched the sledge-driver on the back of the neck. ""What are you up to? What are you hitting me for?"" the peasant shouted, but he whipped up his nag so that it began kicking. The wet snow was falling in big flakes; I unbuttoned myself, regardless of it. I forgot everything else, for I had finally decided on the slap, and felt with horror that it was going to happen NOW, AT ONCE, and that NO FORCE COULD STOP IT. The deserted street lamps gleamed sullenly in the snowy darkness like torches at a funeral. The snow drifted under my great-coat, under my coat, under my cravat, and melted there. I did not wrap myself up--all was lost, anyway. At last we arrived. I jumped out, almost unconscious, ran up the steps and began knocking and kicking at the door. I felt fearfully weak, particularly in my legs and knees. The door was opened quickly as though they knew I was coming. As a fact, Simonov had warned them that perhaps another gentleman would arrive, and this was a place in which one had to give notice and to observe certain precautions. It was one of those ""millinery establishments"" which were abolished by the police a good time ago. By day it really was a shop; but at night, if one had an introduction, one might visit it for other purposes. I walked rapidly through the dark shop into the familiar drawing- room, where there was only one candle burning, and stood still in amazement: there was no one there. ""Where are they?"" I asked somebody. But by now, of course, they had separated. Before me was standing a person with a stupid smile, the ""madam"" herself, who had seen me before. A minute later a door opened and another person came in. Taking no notice of anything I strode about the room, and, I believe, I talked to myself. I felt as though I had been saved from death and was conscious of this, joyfully, all over: I should have given that slap, I should certainly, certainly have given it! But now they were not here and ... everything had vanished and changed! I looked round. I could not realise my condition yet. I looked mechanically at the girl who had come in: and had a glimpse of a fresh, young, rather pale face, with straight, dark eyebrows, and with grave, as it were wondering, eyes that attracted me at once; I should have hated her if she had been smiling. I began looking at her more intently and, as it were, with effort. I had not fully collected my thoughts. There was something simple and good-natured in her face, but something strangely grave. I am sure that this stood in her way here, and no one of those fools had noticed her. She could not, however, have been called a beauty, though she was tall, strong-looking, and well built. She was very simply dressed. Something loathsome stirred within me. I went straight up to her. I chanced to look into the glass. My harassed face struck me as revolting in the extreme, pale, angry, abject, with dishevelled hair. ""No matter, I am glad of it,"" I thought; ""I am glad that I shall seem repulsive to her; I like that.""  VI  ... Somewhere behind a screen a clock began wheezing, as though oppressed by something, as though someone were strangling it. After an unnaturally prolonged wheezing there followed a shrill, nasty, and as it were unexpectedly rapid, chime--as though someone were suddenly jumping forward. It struck two. I woke up, though I had indeed not been asleep but lying half-conscious. It was almost completely dark in the narrow, cramped, low-pitched room, cumbered up with an enormous wardrobe and piles of cardboard boxes and all sorts of frippery and litter. The candle end that had been burning on the table was going out and gave a faint flicker from time to time. In a few minutes there would be complete darkness. I was not long in coming to myself; everything came back to my mind at once, without an effort, as though it had been in ambush to pounce upon me again. And, indeed, even while I was unconscious a point seemed continually to remain in my memory unforgotten, and round it my dreams moved drearily. But strange to say, everything that had happened to me in that day seemed to me now, on waking, to be in the far, far away past, as though I had long, long ago lived all that down. My head was full of fumes. Something seemed to be hovering over me, rousing me, exciting me, and making me restless. Misery and spite seemed surging up in me again and seeking an outlet. Suddenly I saw beside me two wide open eyes scrutinising me curiously and persistently. The look in those eyes was coldly detached, sullen, as it were utterly remote; it weighed upon me. A grim idea came into my brain and passed all over my body, as a horrible sensation, such as one feels when one goes into a damp and mouldy cellar. There was something unnatural in those two eyes, beginning to look at me only now. I recalled, too, that during those two hours I had not said a single word to this creature, and had, in fact, considered it utterly superfluous; in fact, the silence had for some reason gratified me. Now I suddenly realised vividly the hideous idea-- revolting as a spider--of vice, which, without love, grossly and shamelessly begins with that in which true love finds its consummation. For a long time we gazed at each other like that, but she did not drop her eyes before mine and her expression did not change, so that at last I felt uncomfortable. ""What is your name?"" I asked abruptly, to put an end to it. ""Liza,"" she answered almost in a whisper, but somehow far from graciously, and she turned her eyes away. I was silent. ""What weather! The snow ... it's disgusting!"" I said, almost to myself, putting my arm under my head despondently, and gazing at the ceiling. She made no answer. This was horrible. ""Have you always lived in Petersburg?"" I asked a minute later, almost angrily, turning my head slightly towards her. ""No."" ""Where do you come from?"" ""From Riga,"" she answered reluctantly. ""Are you a German?"" ""No, Russian."" ""Have you been here long?"" ""Where?"" ""In this house?"" ""A fortnight."" She spoke more and more jerkily. The candle went out; I could no longer distinguish her face. ""Have you a father and mother?"" ""Yes ... no ... I have."" ""Where are they?"" ""There ... in Riga."" ""What are they?"" ""Oh, nothing."" ""Nothing? Why, what class are they?"" ""Tradespeople."" ""Have you always lived with them?"" ""Yes."" ""How old are you?"" ""Twenty."" ""Why did you leave them?"" ""Oh, for no reason."" That answer meant ""Let me alone; I feel sick, sad."" We were silent. God knows why I did not go away. I felt myself more and more sick and dreary. The images of the previous day began of themselves, apart from my will, flitting through my memory in confusion. I suddenly recalled something I had seen that morning when, full of anxious thoughts, I was hurrying to the office. ""I saw them carrying a coffin out yesterday and they nearly dropped it,"" I suddenly said aloud, not that I desired to open the conversation, but as it were by accident. ""A coffin?"" ""Yes, in the Haymarket; they were bringing it up out of a cellar."" ""From a cellar?"" ""Not from a cellar, but a basement. Oh, you know ... down below ... from a house of ill-fame. It was filthy all round ... Egg-shells, litter ... a stench. It was loathsome."" Silence. ""A nasty day to be buried,"" I began, simply to avoid being silent. ""Nasty, in what way?"" ""The snow, the wet."" (I yawned.) ""It makes no difference,"" she said suddenly, after a brief silence. ""No, it's horrid."" (I yawned again). ""The gravediggers must have sworn at getting drenched by the snow. And there must have been water in the grave."" ""Why water in the grave?"" she asked, with a sort of curiosity, but speaking even more harshly and abruptly than before.  I suddenly began to feel provoked. ""Why, there must have been water at the bottom a foot deep. You can't dig a dry grave in Volkovo Cemetery."" ""Why?"" ""Why? Why, the place is waterlogged. It's a regular marsh. So they bury them in water. I've seen it myself ... many times."" (I had never seen it once, indeed I had never been in Volkovo, and had only heard stories of it.) ""Do you mean to say, you don't mind how you die?"" ""But why should I die?"" she answered, as though defending herself. ""Why, some day you will die, and you will die just the same as that dead woman. She was ... a girl like you. She died of consumption."" ""A wench would have died in hospital ..."" (She knows all about it already: she said ""wench,"" not ""girl."") ""She was in debt to her madam,"" I retorted, more and more provoked by the discussion; ""and went on earning money for her up to the end, though she was in consumption. Some sledge-drivers standing by were talking about her to some soldiers and telling them so. No doubt they knew her. They were laughing. They were going to meet in a pot-house to drink to her memory."" A great deal of this was my invention. Silence followed, profound silence. She did not stir. ""And is it better to die in a hospital?"" ""Isn't it just the same? Besides, why should I die?"" she added irritably. ""If not now, a little later."" ""Why a little later?"" ""Why, indeed? Now you are young, pretty, fresh, you fetch a high price. But after another year of this life you will be very different--you will go off."" ""In a year?"" ""Anyway, in a year you will be worth less,"" I continued malignantly. ""You will go from here to something lower, another house; a year later-- to a third, lower and lower, and in seven years you will come to a basement in the Haymarket. That will be if you were lucky. But it would be much worse if you got some disease, consumption, say ... and caught a chill, or something or other. It's not easy to get over an illness in your way of life. If you catch anything you may not get rid of it. And so you would die."" ""Oh, well, then I shall die,"" she answered, quite vindictively, and she made a quick movement. ""But one is sorry."" ""Sorry for whom?"" ""Sorry for life."" Silence. ""Have you been engaged to be married? Eh?"" ""What's that to you?"" ""Oh, I am not cross-examining you. It's nothing to me. Why are you so cross? Of course you may have had your own troubles. What is it to me? It's simply that I felt sorry."" ""Sorry for whom?"" ""Sorry for you."" ""No need,"" she whispered hardly audibly, and again made a faint movement. That incensed me at once. What! I was so gentle with her, and she .... ""Why, do you think that you are on the right path?"" ""I don't think anything."" ""That's what's wrong, that you don't think. Realise it while there is still time. There still is time. You are still young, good-looking; you might love, be married, be happy ...."" ""Not all married women are happy,"" she snapped out in the rude abrupt tone she had used at first. ""Not all, of course, but anyway it is much better than the life here. Infinitely better. Besides, with love one can live even without happiness. Even in sorrow life is sweet; life is sweet, however one lives. But here what is there but ... foulness? Phew!"" I turned away with disgust; I was no longer reasoning coldly. I began to feel myself what I was saying and warmed to the subject. I was already longing to expound the cherished ideas I had brooded over in my corner. Something suddenly flared up in me. An object had appeared before me. ""Never mind my being here, I am not an example for you. I am, perhaps, worse than you are. I was drunk when I came here, though,"" I hastened, however, to say in self-defence. ""Besides, a man is no example for a woman. It's a different thing. I may degrade and defile myself, but I am not anyone's slave. I come and go, and that's an end of it. I shake it off, and I am a different man. But you are a slave from the start. Yes, a slave! You give up everything, your whole freedom. If you want to break your chains afterwards, you won't be able to; you will be more and more fast in the snares. It is an accursed bondage. I know it. I won't speak of anything else, maybe you won't understand, but tell me: no doubt you are in debt to your madam? There, you see,"" I added, though she made no answer, but only listened in silence, entirely absorbed, ""that's a bondage for you! You will never buy your freedom. They will see to that. It's like selling your soul to the devil .... And besides ... perhaps, I too, am just as unlucky--how do you know--and wallow in the mud on purpose, out of misery? You know, men take to drink from grief; well, maybe I am here from grief. Come, tell me, what is there good here? Here you and I ... came together ... just now and did not say one word to one another all the time, and it was only afterwards you began staring at me like a wild creature, and I at you. Is that loving? Is that how one human being should meet another? It's hideous, that's what it is!"" ""Yes!"" she assented sharply and hurriedly. I was positively astounded by the promptitude of this ""Yes."" So the same thought may have been straying through her mind when she was staring at me just before. So she, too, was capable of certain thoughts? ""Damn it all, this was interesting, this was a point of likeness!"" I thought, almost rubbing my hands. And indeed it's easy to turn a young soul like that! It was the exercise of my power that attracted me most. She turned her head nearer to me, and it seemed to me in the darkness that she propped herself on her arm. Perhaps she was scrutinising me. How I regretted that I could not see her eyes. I heard her deep breathing. ""Why have you come here?"" I asked her, with a note of authority already in my voice. ""Oh, I don't know."" ""But how nice it would be to be living in your father's house! It's warm and free; you have a home of your own."" ""But what if it's worse than this?"" ""I must take the right tone,"" flashed through my mind. ""I may not get far with sentimentality."" But it was only a momentary thought. I swear she really did interest me. Besides, I was exhausted and moody. And cunning so easily goes hand-in-hand with feeling. ""Who denies it!"" I hastened to answer. ""Anything may happen. I am convinced that someone has wronged you, and that you are more sinned against than sinning. Of course, I know nothing of your story, but it's not likely a girl like you has come here of her own inclination ...."" ""A girl like me?"" she whispered, hardly audibly; but I heard it. Damn it all, I was flattering her. That was horrid. But perhaps it was a good thing .... She was silent. ""See, Liza, I will tell you about myself. If I had had a home from childhood, I shouldn't be what I am now. I often think that. However bad it may be at home, anyway they are your father and mother, and not enemies, strangers. Once a year at least, they'll show their love of you. Anyway, you know you are at home. I grew up without a home; and perhaps that's why I've turned so ... unfeeling."" I waited again. ""Perhaps she doesn't understand,"" I thought, ""and, indeed, it is absurd--it's moralising."" ""If I were a father and had a daughter, I believe I should love my daughter more than my sons, really,"" I began indirectly, as though talking of something else, to distract her attention. I must confess I blushed. ""Why so?"" she asked. Ah! so she was listening! ""I don't know, Liza. I knew a father who was a stern, austere man, but used to go down on his knees to his daughter, used to kiss her hands, her feet, he couldn't make enough of her, really. When she danced at parties he used to stand for five hours at a stretch, gazing at her. He was mad over her: I understand that! She would fall asleep tired at night, and he would wake to kiss her in her sleep and make the sign of the cross over her. He would go about in a dirty old coat, he was stingy to everyone else, but would spend his last penny for her, giving her expensive presents, and it was his greatest delight when she was pleased with what he gave her. Fathers always love their daughters more than the mothers do. Some girls live happily at home! And I believe I should never let my daughters marry."" ""What next?"" she said, with a faint smile. ""I should be jealous, I really should. To think that she should kiss anyone else! That she should love a stranger more than her father! It's painful to imagine it. Of course, that's all nonsense, of course every father would be reasonable at last. But I believe before I should let her marry, I should worry myself to death; I should find fault with all her suitors. But I should end by letting her marry whom she herself loved. The one whom the daughter loves always seems the worst to the father, you know. That is always so. So many family troubles come from that."" ""Some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than marrying them honourably."" Ah, so that was it! ""Such a thing, Liza, happens in those accursed families in which there is neither love nor God,"" I retorted warmly, ""and where there is no love, there is no sense either. There are such families, it's true, but I am not speaking of them. You must have seen wickedness in your own family, if you talk like that. Truly, you must have been unlucky. H'm! ... that sort of thing mostly comes about through poverty."" ""And is it any better with the gentry? Even among the poor, honest people who live happily?"" ""H'm ... yes. Perhaps. Another thing, Liza, man is fond of reckoning up his troubles, but does not count his joys. If he counted them up as he ought, he would see that every lot has enough happiness provided for it. And what if all goes well with the family, if the blessing of God is upon it, if the husband is a good one, loves you, cherishes you, never leaves you! There is happiness in such a family! Even sometimes there is happiness in the midst of sorrow; and indeed sorrow is everywhere. If you marry YOU WILL FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. But think of the first years of married life with one you love: what happiness, what happiness there sometimes is in it! And indeed it's the ordinary thing. In those early days even quarrels with one's husband end happily. Some women get up quarrels with their husbands just because they love them. Indeed, I knew a woman like that: she seemed to say that because she loved him, she would torment him and make him feel it. You know that you may torment a man on purpose through love. Women are particularly given to that, thinking to themselves 'I will love him so, I will make so much of him afterwards, that it's no sin to torment him a little now.' And all in the house rejoice in the sight of you, and you are happy and gay and peaceful and honourable .... Then there are some women who are jealous. If he went off anywhere--I knew one such woman, she couldn't restrain herself, but would jump up at night and run off on the sly to find out where he was, whether he was with some other woman. That's a pity. And the woman knows herself it's wrong, and her heart fails her and she suffers, but she loves--it's all through love. And how sweet it is to make up after quarrels, to own herself in the wrong or to forgive him! And they both are so happy all at once--as though they had met anew, been married over again; as though their love had begun afresh. And no one, no one should know what passes between husband and wife if they love one another. And whatever quarrels there may be between them they ought not to call in their own mother to judge between them and tell tales of one another. They are their own judges. Love is a holy mystery and ought to be hidden from all other eyes, whatever happens. That makes it holier and better. They respect one another more, and much is built on respect. And if once there has been love, if they have been married for love, why should love pass away? Surely one can keep it! It is rare that one cannot keep it. And if the husband is kind and straightforward, why should not love last? The first phase of married love will pass, it is true, but then there will come a love that is better still. Then there will be the union of souls, they will have everything in common, there will be no secrets between them. And once they have children, the most difficult times will seem to them happy, so long as there is love and courage. Even toil will be a joy, you may deny yourself bread for your children and even that will be a joy, They will love you for it afterwards; so you are laying by for your future. As the children grow up you feel that you are an example, a support for them; that even after you die your children will always keep your thoughts and feelings, because they have received them from you, they will take on your semblance and likeness. So you see this is a great duty. How can it fail to draw the father and mother nearer? People say it's a trial to have children. Who says that? It is heavenly happiness! Are you fond of little children, Liza? I am awfully fond of them. You know--a little rosy baby boy at your bosom, and what husband's heart is not touched, seeing his wife nursing his child! A plump little rosy baby, sprawling and snuggling, chubby little hands and feet, clean tiny little nails, so tiny that it makes one laugh to look at them; eyes that look as if they understand everything. And while it sucks it clutches at your bosom with its little hand, plays. When its father comes up, the child tears itself away from the bosom, flings itself back, looks at its father, laughs, as though it were fearfully funny, and falls to sucking again. Or it will bite its mother's breast when its little teeth are coming, while it looks sideways at her with its little eyes as though to say, 'Look, I am biting!' Is not all that happiness when they are the three together, husband, wife and child? One can forgive a great deal for the sake of such moments. Yes, Liza, one must first learn to live oneself before one blames others!"" ""It's by pictures, pictures like that one must get at you,"" I thought to myself, though I did speak with real feeling, and all at once I flushed crimson. ""What if she were suddenly to burst out laughing, what should I do then?"" That idea drove me to fury. Towards the end of my speech I really was excited, and now my vanity was somehow wounded. The silence continued. I almost nudged her. ""Why are you--"" she began and stopped. But I understood: there was a quiver of something different in her voice, not abrupt, harsh and unyielding as before, but something soft and shamefaced, so shamefaced that I suddenly felt ashamed and guilty. ""What?"" I asked, with tender curiosity. ""Why, you ..."" ""What?"" ""Why, you ... speak somehow like a book,"" she said, and again there was a note of irony in her voice. That remark sent a pang to my heart. It was not what I was expecting. I did not understand that she was hiding her feelings under irony, that this is usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded, and that their pride makes them refuse to surrender till the last moment and shrink from giving expression to their feelings before you. I ought to have guessed the truth from the timidity with which she had repeatedly approached her sarcasm, only bringing herself to utter it at last with an effort. But I did not guess, and an evil feeling took possession of me. ""Wait a bit!"" I thought.  "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 31,"  Healed by Virgil's forgiveness, Dante moves on with him, moving up the bank out of the Tenth Bolgia and on into the darkness. Dante can see little, but he hears the blast of a horn and, looking toward its source, thinks he sees towers. Virgil warns him that these shapes are not towers but giants, each standing around the edge of the deepest pit of Hell, but so huge that they tower up out of the pit. As Dante sees them more clearly, he is filled with fear, but in fact they are no threat to him. The first is Nimrod, who (according to the  of Genesis) built the Tower of Babel in a proud and defiant attempt to reach Heaven and so caused the one language human beings had spoken up to that time to be lost. He can only babble meaninglessly. Next comes one of the giants who tried to unseat Jove, and he is bound. Finally they come to Antaeus, an old antagonist of Hercules, who can speak and is not bound, and he is easily flattered into setting them down at the bottom of the pit. Virgil holds Dante fast, but Dante is still pretty terrified when he sees Antaeus bend his vast shape toward them-Dante would have preferred another road. But Antaeus sets them down safely. Analysis This canto is almost comic relief, after the ugliness of the ten bolgias of Malebolge, the Eighth Circle. Yet the likeness of the giants to towers was perhaps meant to suggest the towers from which so many aristocrats afflicted the countryside in Italy, towers that were to Dante emblems of humanity destroyed by pride and violence and brute force ruling. Certainly they could be seen as symbols of the forces that run the world when the bond of love that by nature should rule in human hearts is destroyed. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 31," 1. This Canto describes the Plain of the Giants, between Malebolge and the mouth of the Infernal Pit. 4. Iliad, XVI.: ""A Pelion ash, which Chiron gave to his (Achilles') father, cut from the top of Mount Pelion, to be the death of heroes."" Chaucer, Squieres Tale:--  ""And of Achilles for his queinte spere, For he coude with it bothe hele and drere."" And Shakespeare, in King Henry the Sixth, V. i.:--  ""Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear, Is able with the change to kill and cure."" 16. The battle of Roncesvalles,  ""When Charlemain with all his peerage fell By Fontarabia."" 18. Archbishop Turpin, Chronicle, XXIII., Rodd's Tr., thus describes the blowing or Orlando's horn:-- ""He now blew a loud blast with his horn, to summon any Christian concealed in the adjacent woods to his assistance, or to recall his friends beyond the pass. This horn was endued with such power, that all other horns were split by its sound; and it is said that Orlando at that time blew it with such vehemence, that he burst the veins and nerves of his neck. The sound reached the king's ears, who lay encamped in the valley still called by his name, about eight miles from Ronceval, towards Gascony, being carried so far by supernatural power. Charles would have flown to his succor, but was prevented by Ganalon, who, conscious of Orlando's sufferings, insinuated it was usual with him to sound his horn on light occasions. `He is, perhaps', said he, `pursuing some wild beast, and the sound echoes through the woods; it will be fruitless, therefore, to seek him.' O wicked traitor, deceitful as Judas! What dost thou merit?"" Walter Scott in Marmion, VI. 33, makes allusion to Orlando's horn: --  ""O for a blast of that dread horn, On Fontarabian echoes borne, That to King Charles did come, When Rowland brave, and Oliver, And every paladin and peer, On Roncesvalles died!"" Orlando's horn is one of the favorite fictions of old romance, and is surpassed in power only by that of Alexander, which took sixty men to blow it and could be heard at a distance of sixty miles! 41. Montereggione is a picturesque old castle on an eminence near Siena. Ampere, Vogage Dantesque, 251, remarks: ""This fortress, as the commentators say, was furnished with towers all round about, and had none in the centre. In its present state it is still very faithfully described by the verse, 'Montereggion de torri si corona.'"" 59. This pine-cone of bronze, which is now in the gardens of the Vatican, was found in the mausoleum of Hadrian, and is supposed to have crowned its summit. ""I have looked daily"", says Mrs. Kemble, Year of Consolation, 152, ""over the lonely, sunny gardens, open like the palace halls to me, where the widesweeping orange-walks end in some distant view of the sad and noble Campagna, where silver fountains call to each other through the silent, over-arching cloisters of dark and fragrant green, and where the huge bronze pine, by which Dante measured his great giant, yet stands in the midst of graceful vases and bass-reliefs wrought in former ages, and the more graceful blossoms blown within the very hour."" And Ampere, Voyage Dantesque, 277, remarks: ""Here Dante takes as a point of comparison an object of determinate size; the pigna is eleven feet high, the giant then must be seventy; it performs, in the description, the office of those figures which are placed near monuments to render it easier for the eye to measure their height."" Mr. Norton, Travel and Study in Italy, 253, thus speaks of the same object: ""This pine-cone, of bronze, was set originally upon the summit of the Mausoleum of Hadrian. After this imperial sepulchre had undergone many evil fates, and as its ornaments were stripped one by one from it, the cone was in the sixth century taken down, and carried off to adorn a fountain, which had been constructed for the use of dusty and thirsty pilgrims, in a pillared enclosure, called the Paradiso, in front of the old basilica of St. Peter. Here it remained for centuries; and when the old church gave way to the new, it was put where it now stands, useless and out of place, in the trim and formal gardens of the Papal palace."" And adds in a note:-- ""At the present day it serves the bronze-workers of Rome as a model for an inkstand, such as is seen in the shop windows every winter, and is sold to travellers, few of whom know the history and the poetry belonging to its original."" 67. ""The gaping monotony of this jargon"", says Leigh Hunt, ""full of the vowel a, is admirably suited to the mouth of the vast half- stupid speaker. It is like a babble of the gigantic infancy of the world."" 77. Nimrod, the ""mighty hunter before the Lord"", who built the tower of Babel, which, according to the Italian popular tradition, was so high that whoever mounted to the top of it could hear the angels sing. Cory, Ancient Fragments, 51, gives this extract from the Sibylline Oracles:-- ""But when the judgments of the Almighty God Were ripe for execution, when the Tower Rose to the skies upon Assyria's plain, And all mankind one language only knew; A dread commission from on high was given To the fell whirlwinds, which with dire alarms Beat on the Tower, and to its lowest base Shook it convulsed. And now all intercourse, By some occult and overruling power, Ceased among men: by utterance they strove Perplexed and anxious to disclose their mind; But their lip failed them, and in lieu of words Produced a painful babbling sound: the place Was thence called Babel; by th' apostate crew Named from the event. Then severed far away They sped uncertain into realms unknown; Thus kingdoms rose, and the glad world was filled."" 94. Odyssey, XI., Buckley's Tr.: ""God-like Otus and far-famed Ephialtes; whom the faithful earth nourished, the tallest and far the most beautiful, at least after illustrious Orion. For at nine years old they were also nine cubits in width, and in height they were nine fathoms. Who even threatened the immortals that they would set up a strife of impetuous war in Olympus. They attempted to place Ossa upon Olympus, and upon Ossa leafy Pelion, that heaven might be accessible. And they would have accomplished it, if they had reached the measure of youth; but the son of Jove, whom fair-haired Latona bore, destroyed them both, before the down flowered under their temples and thickened upon their cheeks with a flowering beard."" 98. The giant with a hundred hands. Aeneid, X.: ""Aegaeon, who, they say, had a hundred arms and a hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths and breasts; when against the thunder-bolts of Jove he on so many equal bucklers clashed; unsheathed so many swords."" He is supposed to have been a famous pirate, and the fable of the hundred hands arose from the hundred sailors that manned his ship. 100. The giant Antaeus is here unbound, because he had not been at ""the mighty war"" against the gods. 115. The valley of the Bagrada, one of whose branches flows by Zama, the scene of Scipo's great victory over Hannibal, by which he gained his greatest renown and his title of Africanus. Among the neighboring hills, according to Lucan, Pharsalia, IV. , the giant Antaeus had his cave. Speaking of Curio's voyage, he says:--  ""To Afric's coast he cuts the foamy way, Where low the once victorious Carthage lay. There landing, to the well-known camp he hies, Where from afar the distant seas he spies; Where Bagrada's dull waves the sands divide, And slowly downward roll their sluggish tide. From thence he seeks the highest renowned by fame, And hallowed by the great Cornelian name: The rocks and hills which long, traditions say, Where held by huge Antaeus' horrid sway. But greater deeds this rising mountain grace, And Scipio's name ennobles much the place, While, fixing here his famous camp, he calls Fierce Hannibal from Rome's devoted walls. As yet the mouldering works remain in view, Where dreadful once the Latin eagles flew."" 124. |Aeneid, VI.: ""Here too you might have seen Tityus, the foster-child of all-bearing earth, whose body is extended over nine whole acres; and a huge vulture, with her hooked beak, pecking at his immortal liver."" Also Odyssey, XI., in similar words. Typhoeus was a giant wih a hundred heads, like a dragon's who made war upon the gods as soon as he was born. He was the father of Geryon and Cerberus. 132. The battle between Hercules and Antaeus is described by Lucan, Pharsalia, IV.:--  ""Bright in Olympic oil Alcides shone, Antaeus with his mother's dust is strown, And seeks her friendly force to aid his own."" 136. One of the leaning towers of Bologna, which Eustace, Classical Tour, I. 167, thinks are ""remarkable only for their unmeaning elevation and dangerous deviation from the perpendicular."" "
A Tale of Two Cities:Novel Summary: Book I Chapter 1-4," I Chapter 1-4 The narrator begins his story in the year 1775 with the observation that ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" and concludes that it was a period in all respects much like the one nearly 70 years later from which the tale is being told. The narrator observes that there were kings and queens in England and France and that the aristocrats in both countries found little reason to expect any change in their status. At this time the English Crown received reports of unrest from its American colonies and in France the aristocracy continued its trend of overspending at the expense of its working poor. Criminals in both countries were dealt harsh physical punishment for even the smallest of crimes. In England, there were frequent highway robberies and corruption allowed the practice to flourish. On a particularly foggy night in 1775 the mail coach from London to Dover is struggling up a muddy hill. The coach's three nervous passengers walk beside the coach in order to lighten the load for the horses on the grade. The passengers are thickly wrapped and unrecognizable in the fog. Finally, the coach reaches the summit and as the coachmen opens the door for the passengers he hears the sound of a horse approaching. He draws his pistol and expects the worst. Amid much anxiety and suspicion the approaching rider requests an audience with Mr. Jarvis Lorry, one of the passengers, who identifies himself and asks if the rider is a man named Jerry. Learning that this is the case, Mr. Lorry reassures the skittish coach drivers and receives the written message. Mr. Lorry identifies himself to the drivers as a member of Tellson's Bank of London on his way to that company's Paris branch. He reads aloud the brief message: ""Wait at Dover for Mam'selle"" and sends the brief reply, ""Recalled to life."" Jerry departs for London, by way of several roadside ale-houses, with the strange answer and the coach continues on to Dover. As he rides, Jerry muses that he would be in a ""bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion."" Back in the coach, Mr. Lorry holds onto a leather strap, which secures him against the jolting road and allows him to fitfully doze during the journey. He dreams that he is walking in the underground storerooms of Tellson's but in the dream he knows that he is going to dig someone out of their grave. He inquires several times of the spectre how many years it remained entombed and receives the unvarying answer: ""Almost eighteen years."" When he asks the apparition if it is glad to be recalled to life, it answers, ""I can't say."" In the dream he digs to free the buried man but just as the body is unearthed it crumbles to dust. Mr. Lorry awakes in the coach and lowers the window to feel the real rain and mist on his face. The dream repeats often during the journey until Mr. Lorry realizes that the day is breaking. At noon, when the mail coach reaches Dover, Mr. Lorry is the only remaining passenger because the other two men alighted at points along the road. After confirming that a packet ship will leave for Calais, France the following day, Mr. Lorry instructs the head drawer at the Royal George hotel to prepare a bedroom for himself and orders a barber and breakfast. Mr. Lorry emerges from his room clean and shaven and is revealed to be of about sixty years of age and formally dressed in a plain and worn but well-cared-for suit. He takes his breakfast alone before the fire and briefly dozes before his meal arrives. He instructs the drawer to prepare lodgings for a young lady who may arrive at any time that day. A brief but friendly exchange with the waiter reveals that there is much traveling between Tellson's branches, though Mr. Lorry himself has not traveled to Paris in nearly fifteen years. Mr. Lorry spends the day walking the beach, alone with his thoughts. That evening after dinner orders a bottle of claret and just before finishing the wine he hears the sound of an approaching carriage and rightly surmises that it is the Mam'selle he has been expecting. The waiter announces her as Miss Manette and conveys her wish to see him immediately. Mr. Lorry follows the waiter to a darkly furnished room where he meets Miss Manette, a very pretty girl about seventeen years old. He is reminded of a little girl he carried in his arms aboard the packet from Calais to England many years before. Miss Manette relates that she has received a message informing her that a recent discovery regarding her deceased father (whom she never saw in life) has been made and that she must travel to her native land of France. She asks if she may place herself under Mr. Lorry's protection for the journey and he readily assents. She was told that the discovery is of a very surprising nature and that the bank's representative, namely Mr. Lorry, would reveal it to her. Mr. Lorry is somewhat disconcerted at the prospect but begins to relate the story of one of his customers when he worked at Tellson's French branch nearly twenty years prior. Miss Manette soon discerns that Mr. Lorry is speaking of her own father, a man of science, and she also gleans that it was Mr. Lorry himself who brought her to England soon after her mother's subsequent death. Mr. Lorry admits that all that is true but asserts that he is a man of business and his relations with people are business in nature and devoid of strong emotional attachment. He continues his story by suggesting that the fictional character he has invented to stand in the place of Dr. Manette did not die but instead imprisoned with no appeal or outside communication. This information causes Miss Manette to swoon with emotion, but she begs Mr. Lorry to continue his story. After appealing to her to be business-minded about the affair, Mr. Lorry proceeds to tell her that her father has been found alive but greatly affected and changed by long years of imprisonment. Miss Manette reflects that she will be going to see a ghost but Mr. Lorry encourages her to be strong and that perhaps her influence will bring her poor father to reason. He tells her that her father is now under another name and she should not speak his true name aloud while in France, but he then notices that she is not listening but has sunk into a chair and become catatonic. Mr. Lorry calls for help and a large, redheaded woman, Lucie's guardian Miss Pross, comes running into the room and shoves him away. She orders smelling salts, cold water and vinegar and affectionately fawns over Miss Manette. She castigates the flummoxed man of finances for frightening such a fragile girl. Analysis of  The opening commentary attempts to connect the time in which the novel is set the latter half of the eighteenth century, with that of Dickens' contemporary audience. The grand superlative ambiguities, ""it was the best of times, it was the worst of times,"" would be recognizable readers from any age and serves to introduce one of the novel's great themes, that the quality of life is relative to the perspective from which it is drawn. It may have also served as notice to Dickens' regular readers that this story was going to be different from his others, which were set during Dickens' own era. Mirroring the extremes of the introductory section the story begins with the juxtaposition of two opposites: the carriage's slow laborious climb to the top of the hill and the suspense of the dangerous times and the approach of a strange rider through the fog. His claim that he maintains a business-minded outlook and resists emotional involvement is contradicted by his troubled dreams which belie a degree of nervousness about his current errand. Mr. Jarvis Lorry, a man of levelheaded business sensibility is a likable character, typical of the Dickens oeuvre. His memory of carrying Miss Manette over the Channel as a child belies his sympathies for her and his advice that she maintain a business outlook on the situation only serves to reveal his own emotional state. Miss Pross' accusation that he has intentionally frightened the poor girl so undermines his original intent as to make him seem humorous.",A Tale of Two Cities,A Tale of Two Cities:Novel Summary: Book I Chapter 1-4,"Book the First--Recalled to Life I The Period  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow- tradesman whom he stopped in his character of ""the Captain,"" gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, ""in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:"" after which the mall was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.  The Mail  It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty. With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary ""Wo-ho! so-ho- then!"" the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind. There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all. Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in ""the Captain's"" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey. ""Wo-ho!"" said the coachman. ""So, then! One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!"" ""Halloa!"" the guard replied. ""What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"" ""Ten minutes, good, past eleven."" ""My blood!"" ejaculated the vexed coachman, ""and not atop of Shooter's yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!"" The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman. The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in. ""Tst! Joe!"" cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box. ""What do you say, Tom?"" They both listened. ""I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."" ""_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,"" returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. ""Gentlemen! In the kings name, all of you!"" With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive. The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they re-mained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting. The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation. The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. ""So-ho!"" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. ""Yo there! Stand! I shall fire!"" The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, ""Is that the Dover mail?"" ""Never you mind what it is!"" the guard retorted. ""What are you?"" ""IS that the Dover mail?"" ""Why do you want to know?"" ""I want a passenger, if it is."" ""What passenger?"" ""Mr. Jarvis Lorry."" Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully. ""Keep where you are,"" the guard called to the voice in the mist, ""because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."" ""What is the matter?"" asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. ""Who wants me? Is it Jerry?"" (""I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,"" growled the guard to himself. ""He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry."") ""Yes, Mr. Lorry."" ""What is the matter?"" ""A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co."" ""I know this messenger, guard,"" said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. ""He may come close; there's nothing wrong."" ""I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,"" said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. ""Hallo you!"" ""Well! And hallo you!"" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before. ""Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let's look at you."" The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man. ""Guard!"" said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence. The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, ""Sir."" ""There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?"" ""If so be as you're quick, sir."" He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: ""`Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.' It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE."" Jerry started in his saddle. ""That's a Blazing strange answer, too,"" said he, at his hoarsest. ""Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night."" With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action. The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt, looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes. ""Tom!"" softly over the coach roof. ""Hallo, Joe."" ""Did you hear the message?"" ""I did, Joe."" ""What did you make of it, Tom?"" ""Nothing at all, Joe."" ""That's a coincidence, too,"" the guard mused, ""for I made the same of it myself."" Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill. ""After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,"" said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. ""`Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!""  The Night Shadows  A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them? As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the breadth of a county between him and the next. The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again. ""No, Jerry, no!"" said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. ""It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit YOUR line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he'd been a drinking!"" His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over. While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of HER private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road. What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested. Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger-- with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them. But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was always with him, there was another current of impression that never ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one out of a grave. Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and- forty by years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this spectre: ""Buried how long?"" The answer was always the same: ""Almost eighteen years."" ""You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"" ""Long ago."" ""You know that you are recalled to life?"" ""They tell me so."" ""I hope you care to live?"" ""I can't say."" ""Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?"" The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, ""Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon."" Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was, ""Take me to her."" Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it was, ""I don't know her. I don't understand."" After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig, and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek. Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again. ""Buried how long?"" ""Almost eighteen years."" ""I hope you care to live?"" ""I can't say."" Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave. ""Buried how long?"" ""Almost eighteen years."" ""You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"" ""Long ago."" The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone. He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful. ""Eighteen years!"" said the passenger, looking at the sun. ""Gracious Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!""  "

No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.  SIR TOBY. Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.  FABIAN. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.  AGUECHEEK. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count's servingman than ever she bestow'd upon me; I saw't i' th' orchard.  SIR TOBY. Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.  AGUECHEEK. As plain as I see you now.  FABIAN. This was a great argument of love in her toward you.  AGUECHEEK. 'Slight! will you make an ass o' me?  FABIAN. I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.  SIR TOBY. And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.  FABIAN. She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her; and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang'd the youth into dumbness. This was look'd for at your hand, and this was baulk'd. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail'd into the north of my lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.  AGUECHEEK. An't be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician.  SIR TOBY. Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count's youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valour.  FABIAN. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.  AGUECHEEK. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?  SIR TOBY. Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink; if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down; go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it.  AGUECHEEK. Where shall I find you?  SIR TOBY. We'll call thee at the cubiculo. Go.   Exit SIR ANDREW  FABIAN. This is a dear manakin to you, Sir Toby.  SIR TOBY. I have been dear to him, lad- some two thousand strong, or so.  FABIAN. We shall have a rare letter from him; but you'll not deliver't?  SIR TOBY. Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open'd and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of th' anatomy.  FABIAN. And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.   Enter MARIA  SIR TOBY. Look where the youngest wren of nine comes.  MARIA. If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me.

He's in yellow stockings.  SIR TOBY. And cross-garter'd?  MARIA. Most villainously; like a pedant that keeps a school i' th' church. I have dogg'd him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp'd to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as 'tis; I can hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him; if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favour.  SIR TOBY.

"Crime and Punishment: Novel Summary: Part 2, Chapter 4-Part 2, Chapter 6","   Zosimov is a doctor and friend of Razumikhin. When he and Razumikhin begin discussing the murders, Raskolnikov turns away from them as he lies on his couch and faces the wall, studying the wallpaper. Razumikhin and Zosimov heatedly argue over whether the painters could be suspects in the crime. Razumikhin strongly believes they could not have committed it, since they were behaving so jovially immediately following the murder. Suddenly a strange man enters the room. The man turns out to be Peter Petrovich Luzhin, Dunia's fianc�. He is stiff and awkward in his greeting and is met with hostility from Raskolnikov, who suspects (rightly) that he is out to stroke his vanity by marrying a poor woman. He is well-dressed and fresh-scrubbed, in contrast to the squalor of the students' appearance and Raskolnikov's living conditions. Luzhin makes an embarrassing attempt to flatter the youth of today, but is met with disagreement and contempt by the young men (Luzhin is 45). Raskolnikov asks Luzhin if it is true that you told your bride...how glad you were that she was a beggar...because it's more profitable saving a wife from beggary--you can lord it over her and remind her she's in your debt! Luzhin is incensed that his words have been twisted and realizes that Raskolnikov was told about this by his mother. Raskolnikov tells Luzhin to go to hell and demands that he leave. He then tells his friends to go as well, wanting to be alone. ",Crime and Punishment,"Part 2, Chapter 4-Part 2, Chapter 6"," Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever at his work. ""I've been to you twice to-day, brother. You see, he's come to himself,"" cried Razumihin. ""I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?"" said Zossimov to Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could. ""He is still depressed,"" Razumihin went on. ""We've just changed his linen and he almost cried."" ""That's very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish it. . . . His pulse is first-rate. Is your head still aching, eh?"" ""I am well, I am perfectly well!"" Raskolnikov declared positively and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall. Zossimov watched him intently. ""Very good. . . . Going on all right,"" he said lazily. ""Has he eaten anything?"" They told him, and asked what he might have. ""He may have anything . . . soup, tea . . . mushrooms and cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he'd better not have meat either, and . . . but no need to tell you that!"" Razumihin and he looked at each other. ""No more medicine or anything. I'll look at him again to-morrow. Perhaps, to-day even . . . but never mind . . ."" ""To-morrow evening I shall take him for a walk,"" said Razumihin. ""We are going to the Yusupov garden and then to the Palais de Crystal."" ""I would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but I don't know . . . a little, maybe . . . but we'll see."" ""Ach, what a nuisance! I've got a house-warming party to-night; it's only a step from here. Couldn't he come? He could lie on the sofa. You are coming?"" Razumihin said to Zossimov. ""Don't forget, you promised."" ""All right, only rather later. What are you going to do?"" ""Oh, nothing--tea, vodka, herrings. There will be a pie . . . just our friends."" ""And who?"" ""All neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and he is new too--he only arrived in Petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his. We meet once in five years."" ""What is he?"" ""He's been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a little pension. He is sixty-five--not worth talking about. . . . But I am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation Department here . . . But you know him."" ""Is he a relation of yours, too?"" ""A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled once, won't you come then?"" ""I don't care a damn for him."" ""So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov."" ""Do tell me, please, what you or he""--Zossimov nodded at Raskolnikov-- ""can have in common with this Zametov?"" ""Oh, you particular gentleman! Principles! You are worked by principles, as it were by springs; you won't venture to turn round on your own account. If a man is a nice fellow, that's the only principle I go upon. Zametov is a delightful person."" ""Though he does take bribes."" ""Well, he does! and what of it? I don't care if he does take bribes,"" Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. ""I don't praise him for taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways--are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure I shouldn't be worth a baked onion myself . . . perhaps with you thrown in."" ""That's too little; I'd give two for you."" ""And I wouldn't give more than one for you. No more of your jokes! Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him. You'll never improve a man by repelling him, especially a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy. Oh, you progressive dullards! You don't understand. You harm yourselves running another man down. . . . But if you want to know, we really have something in common."" ""I should like to know what."" ""Why, it's all about a house-painter. . . . We are getting him out of a mess! Though indeed there's nothing to fear now. The matter is absolutely self-evident. We only put on steam."" ""A painter?"" ""Why, haven't I told you about it? I only told you the beginning then about the murder of the old pawnbroker-woman. Well, the painter is mixed up in it . . ."" ""Oh, I heard about that murder before and was rather interested in it . . . partly . . . for one reason. . . . I read about it in the papers, too. . . ."" ""Lizaveta was murdered, too,"" Nastasya blurted out, suddenly addressing Raskolnikov. She remained in the room all the time, standing by the door listening. ""Lizaveta,"" murmured Raskolnikov hardly audibly. ""Lizaveta, who sold old clothes. Didn't you know her? She used to come here. She mended a shirt for you, too."" Raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off. He did not attempt to move, but stared obstinately at the flower. ""But what about the painter?"" Zossimov interrupted Nastasya's chatter with marked displeasure. She sighed and was silent. ""Why, he was accused of the murder,"" Razumihin went on hotly. ""Was there evidence against him then?"" ""Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that's what we have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it's all done, it makes one sick, though it's not one's business! Pestryakov may be coming to-night. . . . By the way, Rodya, you've heard about the business already; it happened before you were ill, the day before you fainted at the police office while they were talking about it."" Zossimov looked curiously at Raskolnikov. He did not stir. ""But I say, Razumihin, I wonder at you. What a busybody you are!"" Zossimov observed. ""Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,"" shouted Razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table. ""What's the most offensive is not their lying--one can always forgive lying--lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying. . . . I respect Porfiry, but . . . What threw them out at first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the murderers--that was their logic!"" ""But don't excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not help that. . . . And, by the way, I've met that man Koch. He used to buy unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?"" ""Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It's their sickening rotten, petrified routine. . . . And this case might be the means of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data alone how to get on the track of the real man. 'We have facts,' they say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in how you interpret them!"" ""Can you interpret them, then?"" ""Anyway, one can't hold one's tongue when one has a feeling, a tangible feeling, that one might be a help if only. . . . Eh! Do you know the details of the case?"" ""I am waiting to hear about the painter."" ""Oh, yes! Well, here's the story. Early on the third day after the murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff- an unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller's case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. 'The day before yesterday, just after eight o'clock'--mark the day and the hour!--'a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him anything more.' I am telling you Dushkin's story. 'I gave him a note'--a rouble that is--'for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another. It would all come to the same thing--he'd spend it on drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any rumours, I'll take it to the police.' Of course, that's all taradiddle; he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin's story. 'I've known this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same province and district of Zara�sk, we are both Ryazan men. And though Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too. As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses, took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then. And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, ""Is Nikolay here?"" Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes, and went out again. Dmitri didn't see him again and is finishing the job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to anyone'--that's Dushkin's tale--'but I found out what I could about the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight o'clock this morning'-- that was the third day, you understand--'I saw Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep on a bench and our two boys. ""Have you seen Dmitri?"" said I. ""No, I haven't,"" said he. ""And you've not been here either?"" ""Not since the day before yesterday,"" said he. ""And where did you sleep last night?"" ""In Peski, with the Kolomensky men."" ""And where did you get those ear-rings?"" I asked. ""I found them in the street,"" and the way he said it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. ""Did you hear what happened that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?"" said I. ""No,"" said he, ""I had not heard,"" and all the while he was listening, his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted to keep him. ""Wait a bit, Nikolay,"" said I, ""won't you have a drink?"" And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run. I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his doing, as clear as could be. . . .'"" ""I should think so,"" said Zossimov. ""Wait! Hear the end. Of course they sought high and low for Nikolay; they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested; the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman screeched her hardest; people ran in. 'So that's what you are up to!' 'Take me,' he says, 'to such-and-such a police officer; I'll confess everything.' Well, they took him to that police station-- that is here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old he is, 'twenty-two,' and so on. At the question, 'When you were working with Dmitri, didn't you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?'--answer: 'To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did not notice them.' 'And didn't you hear anything, any noise, and so on?' 'We heard nothing special.' 'And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?' 'I never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.' 'And where did you find the ear-rings?' 'I found them on the pavement.' 'Why didn't you go to work with Dmitri the other day?' 'Because I was drinking.' 'And where were you drinking?' 'Oh, in such-and-such a place.' 'Why did you run away from Dushkin's?' 'Because I was awfully frightened.' 'What were you frightened of?' 'That I should be accused.' 'How could you be frightened, if you felt free from guilt?' Now, Zossimov, you may not believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?"" ""Well, anyway, there's the evidence."" ""I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question, of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed: 'I did not find it in the street, but in the flat where I was painting with Dmitri.' 'And how was that?' 'Why, Dmitri and I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him. I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen were there I don't remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other porter swore, too, and the porter's wife came out, and swore at us, too; and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us, too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri's hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them, and in the box were the ear-rings. . . .'"" ""Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?"" Raskolnikov cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand. ""Yes . . . why? What's the matter? What's wrong?"" Razumihin, too, got up from his seat. ""Nothing,"" Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were silent for a while. ""He must have waked from a dream,"" Razumihin said at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head. ""Well, go on,"" said Zossimov. ""What next?"" ""What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder: 'I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.' 'And why didn't you come to the police till now?' 'I was frightened.' 'And why did you try to hang yourself?' 'From anxiety.' 'What anxiety?' 'That I should be accused of it.' Well, that's the whole story. And now what do you suppose they deduced from that?"" ""Why, there's no supposing. There's a clue, such as it is, a fact. You wouldn't have your painter set free?"" ""Now they've simply taken him for the murderer. They haven't a shadow of doubt."" ""That's nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old woman's box have come into Nikolay's hands, they must have come there somehow. That's a good deal in such a case."" ""How did they get there? How did they get there?"" cried Razumihin. ""How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don't you see at once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped on the box and picked it up."" ""The holy truth! But didn't he own himself that he told a lie at first?"" ""Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who was sitting in the porter's lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his arm, that is eight or ten witnesses, agree that Nikolay had Dmitri on the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they 'like children' (the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another, squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning, robbery? They'd just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention. And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!"" ""Of course it is strange! It's impossible, indeed, but . . ."" ""No, brother, no /buts/. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay's hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent, especially as they are facts that /cannot be denied/. And do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact-- resting simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they won't accept it, they certainly won't, because they found the jewel-case and the man tried to hang himself, 'which he could not have done if he hadn't felt guilty.' That's the point, that's what excites me, you must understand!"" ""Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman?"" ""That's been proved,"" said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning. ""Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that it was his."" ""That's bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no evidence about that?"" ""Nobody did see him,"" Razumihin answered with vexation. ""That's the worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much. They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether there actually were men at work in it."" ""Hm! . . . So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating one another and laughing. That constitutes a strong presumption, but . . . How do you explain the facts yourself?"" ""How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It's clear. At any rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear- rings. The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry; possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there. . . . That's how I explain it."" ""Too clever! No, my boy, you're too clever. That beats everything."" ""But, why, why?"" ""Why, because everything fits too well . . . it's too melodramatic."" ""A-ach!"" Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.  This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance, and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment, as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to. Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov's low and narrow ""cabin."" With the same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled, unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he would get nothing in this ""cabin"" by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov: ""Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?"" Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not Razumihin anticipated him. ""Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?"" This familiar ""what do you want"" seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked himself in time and turned to Zossimov again. ""This is Raskolnikov,"" mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold watch in a round hunter's case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly and lazily proceeded to put it back. Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said ""This is Raskolnikov"" he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, voice articulated: ""Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?"" The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively: ""Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?"" But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time. ""Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no information?"" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted. In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into Luzhin's face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment. ""I had presumed and calculated,"" he faltered, ""that a letter posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago . . ."" ""I say, why are you standing in the doorway?"" Razumihin interrupted suddenly. ""If you've something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here's a chair, thread your way in!"" He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the visitor to ""thread his way in."" The minute was so chosen that it was impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at Razumihin.  Back to Full Books byFyodor Dostoevsky ""No need to be nervous,"" the latter blurted out. ""Rodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him. I am a comrade of Rodya's, like him, formerly a student, and now I am nursing him; so don't you take any notice of us, but go on with your business."" ""Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation?"" Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov. ""N-no,"" mumbled Zossimov; ""you may amuse him."" He yawned again. ""He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,"" went on Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good- nature that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student. ""Your mamma,"" began Luzhin. ""Hm!"" Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him inquiringly. ""That's all right, go on."" Luzhin shrugged his shoulders. ""Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my astonishment . . ."" ""I know, I know!"" Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation. ""So you are the /fianc�/? I know, and that's enough!"" There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch's being offended this time, but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all meant. There was a moment's silence. Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch's whole appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of ""fianc�"" so unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding, indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the r�le of fianc�. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor's and were all right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale, if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr Petrovitch's attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade, light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times. His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides, growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair, touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled at a hairdresser's, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day. If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as before. But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no notice of their oddities. ""I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,"" he began, again breaking the silence with an effort. ""If I had been aware of your illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your mamma and sister any minute."" Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing followed, he went on: "". . . Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival."" ""Where?"" asked Raskolnikov weakly. ""Very near here, in Bakaleyev's house."" ""That's in Voskresensky,"" put in Razumihin. ""There are two storeys of rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I've been there."" ""Yes, rooms . . ."" ""A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what's more, of doubtful character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It's cheap, though . . ."" ""I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger in Petersburg myself,"" Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. ""However, the two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time . . . I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,"" he said, addressing Raskolnikov, ""and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me of Bakaleyev's house, too . . ."" ""Lebeziatnikov?"" said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something. ""Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you know him?"" ""Yes . . . no,"" Raskolnikov answered. ""Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian. . . . A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one learns new things from them."" Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all. ""How do you mean?"" asked Razumihin. ""In the most serious and essential matters,"" Pyotr Petrovitch replied, as though delighted at the question. ""You see, it's ten years since I visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg. And it's my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the younger generation. And I confess I am delighted . . ."" ""At what?"" ""Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality . . ."" ""That's true,"" Zossimov let drop. ""Nonsense! There's no practicality."" Razumihin flew at him. ""Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,"" he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, ""and desire for good exists, though it's in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands. Anyway, there's no practicality. Practicality goes well shod."" ""I don't agree with you,"" Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident enjoyment. ""Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak. It's my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors. Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudice have been rooted up and turned into ridicule. . . . In a word, we have cut ourselves off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great thing . . ."" ""He's learnt it by heart to show off!"" Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly. ""What?"" asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received no reply. ""That's all true,"" Zossimov hastened to interpose. ""Isn't it so?"" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov. ""You must admit,"" he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousness--he almost added ""young man""--""that there is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and economic truth . . ."" ""A commonplace."" ""No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, 'love thy neighbour,' what came of it?"" Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with excessive haste. ""It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has it, 'Catch several hares and you won't catch one.' Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to pass my neighbour's getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it would seem to want very little wit to perceive it . . ."" ""Excuse me, I've very little wit myself,"" Razumihin cut in sharply, ""and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I've grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that, by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don't blame you, that's quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That's enough!"" ""Excuse me, sir,"" said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive dignity. ""Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too . . ."" ""Oh, my dear sir . . . how could I? . . . Come, that's enough,"" Razumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to Zossimov to continue their previous conversation. Pyotr Petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. He made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two. ""I trust our acquaintance,"" he said, addressing Raskolnikov, ""may, upon your recovery and in view of the circumstances of which you are aware, become closer . . . Above all, I hope for your return to health . . ."" Raskolnikov did not even turn his head. Pyotr Petrovitch began getting up from his chair. ""One of her customers must have killed her,"" Zossimov declared positively. ""Not a doubt of it,"" replied Razumihin. ""Porfiry doesn't give his opinion, but is examining all who have left pledges with her there."" ""Examining them?"" Raskolnikov asked aloud. ""Yes. What then?"" ""Nothing."" ""How does he get hold of them?"" asked Zossimov. ""Koch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves."" ""It must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! The boldness of it! The coolness!"" ""That's just what it wasn't!"" interposed Razumihin. ""That's what throws you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn't work. Suppose him to have been inexperienced, and it's clear that it was only a chance that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the old woman's trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles, besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know how to rob; he could only murder. It was his first crime, I assure you, his first crime; he lost his head. And he got off more by luck than good counsel!"" ""You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?"" Pyotr Petrovitch put in, addressing Zossimov. He was standing, hat and gloves in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more intellectual phrases. He was evidently anxious to make a favourable impression and his vanity overcame his prudence. ""Yes. You've heard of it?"" ""Oh, yes, being in the neighbourhood."" ""Do you know the details?"" ""I can't say that; but another circumstance interests me in the case-- the whole question, so to say. Not to speak of the fact that crime has been greatly on the increase among the lower classes during the last five years, not to speak of the cases of robbery and arson everywhere, what strikes me as the strangest thing is that in the higher classes, too, crime is increasing proportionately. In one place one hears of a student's robbing the mail on the high road; in another place people of good social position forge false banknotes; in Moscow of late a whole gang has been captured who used to forge lottery tickets, and one of the ringleaders was a lecturer in universal history; then our secretary abroad was murdered from some obscure motive of gain. . . . And if this old woman, the pawnbroker, has been murdered by someone of a higher class in society--for peasants don't pawn gold trinkets-- how are we to explain this demoralisation of the civilised part of our society?"" ""There are many economic changes,"" put in Zossimov. ""How are we to explain it?"" Razumihin caught him up. ""It might be explained by our inveterate impracticality."" ""How do you mean?"" ""What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes? 'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working! We've grown used to having everything ready-made, to walking on crutches, to having our food chewed for us. Then the great hour struck,[*] and every man showed himself in his true colours."" [*] The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 is meant.--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE. ""But morality? And so to speak, principles . . ."" ""But why do you worry about it?"" Raskolnikov interposed suddenly. ""It's in accordance with your theory!"" ""In accordance with my theory?"" ""Why, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed . . ."" ""Upon my word!"" cried Luzhin. ""No, that's not so,"" put in Zossimov. Raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing painfully. ""There's a measure in all things,"" Luzhin went on superciliously. ""Economic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose . . ."" ""And is it true,"" Raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, ""is it true that you told your /fianc�e/ . . . within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most . . . was that she was a beggar . . . because it was better to raise a wife from poverty, so that you may have complete control over her, and reproach her with your being her benefactor?"" ""Upon my word,"" Luzhin cried wrathfully and irritably, crimson with confusion, ""to distort my words in this way! Excuse me, allow me to assure you that the report which has reached you, or rather, let me say, has been conveyed to you, has no foundation in truth, and I . . . suspect who . . . in a word . . . this arrow . . . in a word, your mamma . . . She seemed to me in other things, with all her excellent qualities, of a somewhat high-flown and romantic way of thinking. . . . But I was a thousand miles from supposing that she would misunderstand and misrepresent things in so fanciful a way. . . . And indeed . . . indeed . . ."" ""I tell you what,"" cried Raskolnikov, raising himself on his pillow and fixing his piercing, glittering eyes upon him, ""I tell you what."" ""What?"" Luzhin stood still, waiting with a defiant and offended face. Silence lasted for some seconds. ""Why, if ever again . . . you dare to mention a single word . . . about my mother . . . I shall send you flying downstairs!"" ""What's the matter with you?"" cried Razumihin. ""So that's how it is?"" Luzhin turned pale and bit his lip. ""Let me tell you, sir,"" he began deliberately, doing his utmost to restrain himself but breathing hard, ""at the first moment I saw you you were ill-disposed to me, but I remained here on purpose to find out more. I could forgive a great deal in a sick man and a connection, but you . . . never after this . . ."" ""I am not ill,"" cried Raskolnikov. ""So much the worse . . ."" ""Go to hell!"" But Luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; Razumihin got up this time to let him pass. Without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to Zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. And even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received. ""How could you--how could you!"" Razumihin said, shaking his head in perplexity. ""Let me alone--let me alone all of you!"" Raskolnikov cried in a frenzy. ""Will you ever leave off tormenting me? I am not afraid of you! I am not afraid of anyone, anyone now! Get away from me! I want to be alone, alone, alone!"" ""Come along,"" said Zossimov, nodding to Razumihin. ""But we can't leave him like this!"" ""Come along,"" Zossimov repeated insistently, and he went out. Razumihin thought a minute and ran to overtake him. ""It might be worse not to obey him,"" said Zossimov on the stairs. ""He mustn't be irritated."" ""What's the matter with him?"" ""If only he could get some favourable shock, that's what would do it! At first he was better. . . . You know he has got something on his mind! Some fixed idea weighing on him. . . . I am very much afraid so; he must have!"" ""Perhaps it's that gentleman, Pyotr Petrovitch. From his conversation I gather he is going to marry his sister, and that he had received a letter about it just before his illness. . . ."" ""Yes, confound the man! he may have upset the case altogether. But have you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited--that's the murder?"" ""Yes, yes,"" Razumihin agreed, ""I noticed that, too. He is interested, frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police office; he fainted."" ""Tell me more about that this evening and I'll tell you something afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I'll go and see him again. . . . There'll be no inflammation though."" ""Thanks! And I'll wait with Pashenka meantime and will keep watch on him through Nastasya. . . ."" Raskolnikov, left alone, looked with impatience and misery at Nastasya, but she still lingered. ""Won't you have some tea now?"" she asked. ""Later! I am sleepy! Leave me."" He turned abruptly to the wall; Nastasya went out.  "

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Novel Summary: Chapters 28-30,"     In this chapter Huck meets with Mary Jane, one of the Wilks girls with whom he has become especially close, and he tells her that the king and duke are frauds and that he has taken the money from them. He writes a note to her telling her where he has hidden the gold. By the end of the chapter, real trouble for the king and duke has come with the arrival of the legitimate heirs. It seems a confrontation will soon follow.  To make a long story short, there's a lengthy dispute between the two pairs of heirs. As time passes, however, it becomes increasingly clear that the king and duke are frauds. All of the tension comes to a fountainhead at the burial of Peter Wilks, where the gold is discovered. Leaving the king and duke to pay the penalty for their fraudulent scheming, Huck breaks free from the group and runs back to the river, where Jim has been waiting for him. Unfortunately, the king and duke follow him to the raft, angry that Huck was trying to give them the slip.""  So the foursome continues its journey down river, free from the town, but with the king and duke's scheme utterly foiled. Taking the pressure off of Huck for a moment, the king and duke argue amongst themselves, now suspecting each other of betrayal.",The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Chapters 28-30,". BY and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls' room the door was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was open and she'd been packing things in it--getting ready to go to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap, and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it; of course anybody would. I went in there and says: ""Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I can't-- most always. Tell me about it."" So she done it. And it was the niggers--I just expected it. She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her; she didn't know HOW she was ever going to be happy there, knowing the mother and the children warn't ever going to see each other no more--and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung up her hands, and says: ""Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain't EVER going to see each other any more!"" ""But they WILL--and inside of two weeks--and I KNOW it!"" says I. Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN! I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place. I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it looks so to me, anyway; and yet here's a case where I'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says: ""Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days?"" ""Yes; Mr. Lothrop's. Why?"" ""Never mind why yet. If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks--here in this house--and PROVE how I know it--will you go to Mr. Lothrop's and stay four days?"" ""Four days!"" she says; ""I'll stay a year!"" ""All right,"" I says, ""I don't want nothing more out of YOU than just your word--I druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible."" She smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, ""If you don't mind it, I'll shut the door--and bolt it."" Then I come back and set down again, and says: ""Don't you holler. Just set still and take it like a man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary, because it's a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain't no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of frauds-- regular dead-beats. There, now we're over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling easy."" It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times--and then up she jumps, with her face afire like sunset, and says: ""The brute! Come, don't waste a minute--not a SECOND--we'll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!"" Says I: ""Cert'nly. But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr. Lothrop's, or--"" ""Oh,"" she says, ""what am I THINKING about!"" she says, and set right down again. ""Don't mind what I said--please don't--you WON'T, now, WILL you?"" Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first. ""I never thought, I was so stirred up,"" she says; ""now go on, and I won't do so any more. You tell me what to do, and whatever you say I'll do it."" ""Well,"" I says, ""it's a rough gang, them two frauds, and I'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer, whether I want to or not--I druther not tell you why; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I'd be all right; but there'd be another person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble. Well, we got to save HIM, hain't we? Of course. Well, then, we won't blow on them."" Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then leave. But I didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says: ""Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop's so long, nuther. How fur is it?"" ""A little short of four miles--right out in the country, back here."" ""Well, that 'll answer. Now you go along out there, and lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you home again-- tell them you've thought of something. If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don't turn up wait TILL eleven, and THEN if I don't turn up it means I'm gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed."" ""Good,"" she says, ""I'll do it."" ""And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can."" ""Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!"" she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it, too. ""If I get away I sha'n't be here,"" I says, ""to prove these rapscallions ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I WAS here. I could swear they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something. Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be. I'll tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper. There--'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.' Put it away, and don't lose it. When the court wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary. And they'll come a-biling, too."" I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says: ""Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry. Nobody don't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count, and they ain't going to get no money. It's just like the way it was with the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can't collect the money for the NIGGERS yet--they're in the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary."" ""Well,"" she says, ""I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop's."" ""'Deed, THAT ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,"" I says, ""by no manner of means; go BEFORE breakfast."" ""Why?"" ""What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?"" ""Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know. What was it?"" ""Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people. I don't want no better book than what your face is. A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--"" ""There, there, don't! Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?"" ""Yes; never mind about them. They've got to stand it yet a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go. I don't want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them. I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning."" ""Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to them."" ""Well, then, it sha'n't be."" It was well enough to tell HER so--no harm in it. It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing. Then I says: ""There's one more thing--that bag of money."" ""Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it."" ""No, you're out, there. They hain't got it."" ""Why, who's got it?"" ""I wish I knowed, but I don't. I HAD it, because I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it ain't there no more. I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run--and it warn't a good place."" ""Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow it-- you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault. Where did you hide it?"" I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach. So for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says: ""I'd ruther not TELL you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to. Do you reckon that 'll do?"" ""Oh, yes."" So I wrote: ""I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane."" It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard, and says: ""GOOD-bye. I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of you a many and a many a time, and I'll PRAY for you, too!""--and she was gone. Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there warn't no back-down to her, I judge. You may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It sounds like flattery, but it ain't no flattery. And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays over them all. I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust. Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says: ""What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes?"" They says: ""There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."" ""That's the name,"" I says; ""I most forgot it. Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of them's sick."" ""Which one?"" ""I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--"" ""Sakes alive, I hope it ain't HANNER?"" ""I'm sorry to say it,"" I says, ""but Hanner's the very one."" ""My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?"" ""It ain't no name for it. They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don't think she'll last many hours."" ""Only think of that, now! What's the matter with her?"" I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says: ""Mumps."" ""Mumps your granny! They don't set up with people that's got the mumps."" ""They don't, don't they? You better bet they do with THESE mumps. These mumps is different. It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said."" ""How's it a new kind?"" ""Because it's mixed up with other things."" ""What other things?"" ""Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all."" ""My land! And they call it the MUMPS?"" ""That's what Miss Mary Jane said."" ""Well, what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for?"" ""Why, because it IS the mumps. That's what it starts with."" ""Well, ther' ain't no sense in it. A body might stump his toe, and take pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull up and say, 'Why, he stumped his TOE.' Would ther' be any sense in that? NO. And ther' ain't no sense in THIS, nuther. Is it ketching?"" ""Is it KETCHING? Why, how you talk. Is a HARROW catching--in the dark? If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good."" ""Well, it's awful, I think,"" says the hare-lip. ""I'll go to Uncle Harvey and--"" ""Oh, yes,"" I says, ""I WOULD. Of COURSE I would. I wouldn't lose no time."" ""Well, why wouldn't you?"" ""Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see. Hain't your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can? And do you reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves? YOU know they'll wait for you. So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he? Very well, then; is a PREACHER going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK? --so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now YOU know he ain't. What WILL he do, then? Why, he'll say, 'It's a great pity, but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she's got it.' But never mind, if you think it's best to tell your uncle Harvey--"" ""Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins."" ""Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors."" ""Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness. Can't you SEE that THEY'D go and tell? Ther' ain't no way but just to not tell anybody at ALL."" ""Well, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you ARE right."" ""But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while, anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?"" ""Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says, 'Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what IS the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--"" ""Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"" ""Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come, and then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll be home in the morning anyway. She said, don't say nothing about the Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be perfectly true, because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told me so herself."" ""All right,"" they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message. Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn't say nothing because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not being brung up to it. Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly. But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold-- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard. So they'd got to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING. Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out: ""HERE'S your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!"" .  THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice- looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn't see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they'd turn pale. But no, nary a pale did THEY turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo- gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman--not the king's way, though the king's WAS pretty good for an imitation. I can't give the old gent's words, nor I can't imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this: ""This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to amount to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait."" So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out: ""Broke his arm--VERY likely, AIN'T it?--and very convenient, too, for a fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how. Lost their baggage! That's MIGHTY good!--and mighty ingenious--under the CIRCUMSTANCES!"" So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says: ""Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?"" ""The day before the funeral, friend,"" says the king. ""But what time o' day?"" ""In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown."" ""HOW'D you come?"" ""I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati."" ""Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNIN'--in a canoe?"" ""I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."" ""It's a lie."" Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher. ""Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that mornin'. I live up there, don't I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy."" The doctor he up and says: ""Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?"" ""I reckon I would, but I don't know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy."" It was me he pointed at. The doctor says: ""Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if THESE two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all. I think it's our duty to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I reckon we'll find out SOMETHING before we get through."" It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand. We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says: ""I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about. If they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all right--ain't that so?"" Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says: ""Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o' this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send and see, if you want to."" ""Where is it, then?"" ""Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein' used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down stairs; and when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen."" The doctor and several said ""Shucks!"" and I see nobody didn't altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says: ""Are YOU English, too?"" I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, ""Stuff!"" Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies. And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says: ""Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward."" I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway. The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says: ""If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--"" The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says: ""Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often about?"" The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: ""That 'll fix it. I'll take the order and send it, along with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."" So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: ""You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names."" The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: ""Well, it beats ME""--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then THEM again; and then says: ""These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here's THESE two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't write them"" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), ""and here's THIS old gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, HE didn't write them--fact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly WRITING at all. Now, here's some letters from--"" The new old gentleman says: ""If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there--so he copies for me. It's HIS hand you've got there, not mine."" ""WELL!"" says the lawyer, ""this IS a state of things. I've got some of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can com--"" ""He CAN'T write with his left hand,"" says the old gentleman. ""If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please--they're by the same hand."" The lawyer done it, and says: ""I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a slution, but it's gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved--THESE two ain't either of 'em Wilkses""--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke. Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in THEN! Indeed he wouldn't. Said it warn't no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write-- HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: ""I've thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?"" ""Yes,"" says somebody, ""me and Ab Turner done it. We're both here."" Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: ""Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?"" Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, NOW he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use. Well, did he? A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't. I reckon he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says: ""Mf! It's a VERY tough question, AIN'T it! YES, sir, I k'n tell you what's tattooed on his breast. It's jest a small, thin, blue arrow-- that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it. NOW what do you say--hey?"" Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek. The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king THIS time, and says: ""There--you've heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks' breast?"" Both of them spoke up and says: ""We didn't see no such mark."" ""Good!"" says the old gentleman. ""Now, what you DID see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P--B--W""--and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. ""Come, ain't that what you saw?"" Both of them spoke up again, and says: ""No, we DIDN'T. We never seen any marks at all."" Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, and they sings out: ""The whole BILIN' of 'm 's frauds! Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's ride 'em on a rail!"" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says: ""Gentlemen--gentleMEN! Hear me just a word--just a SINGLE word--if you PLEASE! There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look."" That took them. ""Hooray!"" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out: ""Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch THEM along, too!"" ""We'll do it!"" they all shouted; ""and if we don't find them marks we'll lynch the whole gang!"" I WAS scared, now, I tell you. But there warn't no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening. As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats. Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn't find them-- I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist-- Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up. When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one. So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all. At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting. All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out: ""By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"" Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell. I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along! When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world. She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand. The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn't. As I sprung aboard I sung out: ""Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we're shut of them!"" Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says: ""Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her slide!"" So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke. So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all I could do to keep from crying. "

A Tale of Two Cities: Novel Summary: Book II Chapter 15-16," For three days in a row there has been more than the usual number of early drinkers in the Defarge's wine shop. Monsieur Defarge has been absent for several days but Madame Defarge tends to her customers, many of whom come not to drink but to whisper conspiracies. When known spies for the government enter the conversation ceases and Madame Defarge knits steadily. At noon on the third day Monsieur Defarge enters the shop with the mender of roads from the small village where the Marquis was murdered. All the men refer to each other as ""JACQUES."" While the mender of roads takes a thin meal of stale bread and wine, various men get up and leave the shop to go to the garret apartment. Eventually Defarge and the road mender join the others. The road mender says that a man the Parisians know to be Gaspard, father of the child run over by the Marquis' carriage, was captured by the soldiers of his village. He was beaten and placed in a cage suspended above the prison and for many days the people in the town witnessed his suffering but could do nothing to help him. The villagers heard that a petition had been presented to the King to spare the man's life but they didn't know if it was true. Two of the Jacques interrupt the story and explain to the road mender that Defarge himself hazarded his own life by stepping in front of the King's carriage and was beaten for presenting the petition. The mender of roads says that the people of the village whispered that in Paris prisoners were horribly tortured before being killed and another of the Jacques affirms this fact. One morning the village awoke to find a gallows erected next to their communal fountain. That afternoon Gaspard was hung and his body left to rot with the murder weapon decorating the gallows. His story finished, the road mender is asked to wait outside while Defarge and the various Jacques confer. They all agree to include the Marquis' entire family and his chateau on their list of those registered for destruction. Defarge assures the men that the authorities will not discover his wife's method of keeping the list, sewn as code into her knitting. Before the road mender returns to his village the Defarge's take him to see a royal procession. The road mender is overcome by the gallantry and reach pageantry of the aristocracy that he cries out his enthusiasm. Later the Defarges commend his zeal and remind him that it will be useful when the time comes to destroy the aristocracy. The road mender returns to his village wiser and for the first time in his simple life, empowered. The Defarge's return to the wine shop and Monsieur Defarge learns from a Jacques of the police that a new spy named John Barsad has started working the Saint Antoine district. As she shuts up the shop for the night Madame Defarge observes that her husband is depressed and he admits that he is sad that the revolution may not come in his lifetime. She reminds him that it could come at any moment and though it may not arrive while they live she is confident they have done much to help bring it to fruition. The next day a man Madame Defarge recognizes as the spy John Barsad comes into the shop and tries to bait her into revealing the district's sympathies for the executed Gaspard. As a signal to the others in the shop she places a flower in her hair and the shop quickly empties. As Barsad tries to bait her, Madame Defarge knits his name into the register. Monsieur Defarge joins them and the spy, knowing that Doctor Manette sheltered with the Defarge's, relates the news that Miss Manette is to marry the nephew of the murdered Marquis who is living under the name Darnay in England. Madame records this information in her register as well. After the spy leaves, Monsieur Defarge expresses his hope that destiny will keep Darnay out of France but his wife observes that fate will do what it will. That evening Monsieur Defarge admires the character of his wife as she goes throughout the street visiting the women. Analysis of 6 These chapters juxtapose the horrible death of Gaspard with the increasing unrest in Paris. Significantly, the mender of roads from the village is the one to convey the news of Gaspard's death and his horror at effect upon his fellow villagers connects with the sentiments already being pursued by the society of Jacques in Saint Antoine. The manner in which the Defarge's use his zeal for the pageantry of the procession to remind him that such zeal can be turned to his own advantage encapsulates the manner in which the methodical planning of the Jacques and their agenda can be readily accepted by the rural peasants who have suffered as much under the wasteful aristocratic rule. Madame Defarge emerges from this section as a prime motivator for the revolution. She is differentiated from her husband in two ways. First, she is shown to be more patient and determined when she demonstrates to him that it is only necessary that their enemies suffer not that they do the actual persecution. Second, she does not express any sympathy for Charles Darnay whom she considers a member of the aristocracy and therefore irredeemable in her eyes.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 15-16," Knitting  There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come. A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the kings palace to the criminal's gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off. Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them. ""Good day, gentlemen!"" said Monsieur Defarge. It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of ""Good day!"" ""It is bad weather, gentlemen,"" said Defarge, shaking his head. Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out. ""My wife,"" said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: ""I have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!"" A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out. Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work. ""Have you finished your repast, friend?"" he asked, in due season. ""Yes, thank you."" ""Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."" Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret,--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes. No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: ""Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!"" The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, ""Where shall I commence, monsieur?"" ""Commence,"" was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, ""at the commencement."" ""I saw him then, messieurs,"" began the mender of roads, ""a year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this."" Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year. Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? ""Never,"" answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? ""By his tall figure,"" said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. ""When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, `Tall as a spectre.'"" ""You should have said, short as a dwarf,"" returned Jacques Two. ""But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, `To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."" ""He is right there, Jacques,"" murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. ""Go on!"" ""Good!"" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. ""The tall man is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?"" ""No matter, the number,"" said Defarge. ""He is well hidden, but at last he is unluckily found. Go on!"" ""I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!"" With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him. ""I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!"" He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life. ""I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with our eyes. `Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the village, `bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!"" He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets. ""As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!"" He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again, Defarge said, ""Go on, Jacques."" ""All the village,"" pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low voice, ""withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a dead man."" Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him. ""Go on, Jacques,"" said Defarge. ""He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."" ""Listen then, Jacques,"" Number One of that name sternly interposed. ""Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand."" ""And once again listen, Jacques!"" said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; ""the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?"" ""I hear, messieurs."" ""Go on then,"" said Defarge. ""Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,"" resumed the countryman, ""that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar."" ""Listen once again then, Jacques!"" said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. ""The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was done--why, how old are you?"" ""Thirty-five,"" said the mender of roads, who looked sixty. ""It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen it."" ""Enough!"" said Defarge, with grim impatience. ""Long live the Devil! Go on."" ""Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water."" The mender of roads looked THROUGH rather than AT the low ceiling, and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky. ""All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out, the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed."" He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners of his mouth to his ears. ""On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water."" They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle. ""It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church, across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"" The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him. ""That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do), and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here you see me!"" After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, ""Good! You have acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the door?"" ""Very willingly,"" said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned. The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to the garret. ""How say you, Jacques?"" demanded Number One. ""To be registered?"" ""To be registered, as doomed to destruction,"" returned Defarge. ""Magnificent!"" croaked the man with the craving. ""The chateau, and all the race?"" inquired the first. ""The chateau and all the race,"" returned Defarge. ""Extermination."" The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, ""Magnificent!"" and began gnawing another finger. ""Are you sure,"" asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, ""that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?"" ""Jacques,"" returned Defarge, drawing himself up, ""if madame my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives, to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."" There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who hungered, asked: ""Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"" ""He knows nothing,"" said Defarge; ""at least nothing more than would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and Court; let him see them on Sunday."" ""What?"" exclaimed the hungry man, staring. ""Is it a good sign, that he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"" ""Jacques,"" said Defarge; ""judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish him to bring it down one day."" Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon asleep. Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out. Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen. ""You work hard, madame,"" said a man near her. ""Yes,"" answered Madame Defarge; ""I have a good deal to do."" ""What do you make, madame?"" ""Many things."" ""For instance--"" ""For instance,"" returned Madame Defarge, composedly, ""shrouds."" The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces. ""Bravo!"" said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; ""you are a good boy!"" The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no. ""You are the fellow we want,"" said Defarge, in his ear; ""you make these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended."" ""Hey!"" cried the mender of roads, reflectively; ""that's true."" ""These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much."" Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation. ""As to you,"" said she, ""you would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?"" ""Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment."" ""If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?"" ""Truly yes, madame."" ""Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"" ""It is true, madame."" ""You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,"" said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; ""now, go home!""  "
The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 16-17,"Henry’s regiment marches to some trenches to relieve another group of soldiers. The noise of various skirmishes is loud. Guns are roaring. Rumors spread that their army has been defeated. The regiment then marches through the woods, as Henry complains loudly about the incompetence of the generals. He and Wilson agree that the regiment fights hard. Wilson says they do not have any luck, and Henry persists in blaming the generals. But after another soldier makes a sarcastic remark to him, he feels threatened and keeps quiet. The troops halt in a clearing in the woods. They know a battle is imminent, and the lieutenant berates his men for arguing too much. There is rifle fire from the thicket in front of the regiment. The battle is upon them. Henry fumes with rage and exasperation. He wants to rest, not fight. As he waits with his fingers on his rifle, he conceives a hatred for the enemy. As the battle gets underway, he is conscious only of this hate, and his desire to crush the enemy. He determines to hold his position whatever happens, and he fires his rifle with ferocity. He does not even notice when there is a lull in the battle. He stands alone, still firing. When the smoke clears he sees that the ground ahead of him is deserted. The enemy has retreated. The lieutenant offers him high praise, and his comrades look admiringly on him as a “war devil.” When Henry reflects on what has happened, he is struck by how easy it was for him. He had fought like a beast, and become a hero. But he knows nothing of how it had all happened. As for the other men in the regiment, they are jubilant, and celebrate their victory with pride. Analysis Henry continues to discover more about himself. Earlier, after long pondering the question of how he would react in a battle, he had found he was capable of an act of cowardice. Now, he shows he is also capable of acting courageously. He is so intent on the battle that he loses all sense of danger and is barely conscious of what he is doing. He discovers for himself the truth of what he had been told before he had ever tasted combat: “The youth had been taught that a man became another thing in a battle. He saw his salvation in such a change.” This reflection comes in chapter 3, just before the battle in which Henry runs away. As a coward, Henry was like a condemned man. Now, after his feats on the battlefield, he is like a man who has been saved. This section also marks the beginning of the bond that forms between Henry and the lieutenant. Earlier, Henry had regarded the lieutenant with distaste, as a crude man, quite the opposite of himself. But the lieutenant, whatever he may of thought of Henry, now regards him with admiration, saying that if he had ten thousand “wild cats” like Henry, he could win the war in less than a week. ",The Red Badge of Courage,The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 16-17,"  A SPUTTERING of musketry was always to be heard. Later, the cannon had entered the dis- pute. In the fog-filled air their voices made a thudding sound. The reverberations were con- tinued. This part of the world led a strange, battleful existence. The youth's regiment was marched to relieve a command that had lain long in some damp trenches. The men took positions behind a curv- ing line of rifle pits that had been turned up, like a large furrow, along the line of woods. Before them was a level stretch, peopled with short, deformed stumps. From the woods beyond came the dull popping of the skirmishers and pickets, firing in the fog. From the right came the noise of a terrific fracas. The men cuddled behind the small embank- ment and sat in easy attitudes awaiting their turn. Many had their backs to the firing. The youth's friend lay down, buried his face in his 154 arms, and almost instantly, it seemed, he was in a deep sleep. The youth leaned his breast against the brown dirt and peered over at the woods and up and down the line. Curtains of trees interfered with his ways of vision. He could see the low line of trenches but for a short distance. A few idle flags were perched on the dirt hills. Behind them were rows of dark bodies with a few heads sticking curiously over the top. Always the noise of skirmishers came from the woods on the front and left, and the din on the right had grown to frightful proportions. The guns were roaring without an instant's pause for breath. It seemed that the cannon had come from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous wrangle. It became impossible to make a sen- tence heard. The youth wished to launch a joke--a quota- tion from newspapers. He desired to say, ""All quiet on the Rappahannock,"" but the guns refused to permit even a comment upon their uproar. He never successfully concluded the sentence. But at last the guns stopped, and among the men in the rifle pits rumors again flew, like birds, but they were now for the most part black creatures who flapped their wings drearily near to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of hope. The men's faces grew doleful from the interpreting of omens. Tales of hesitation and uncertainty on the part of those high in place and responsibility came to their ears. Stories of disaster were borne into their minds with many proofs. This din of musketry on the right, grow- ing like a released genie of sound, expressed and emphasized the army's plight. The men were disheartened and began to mutter. They made gestures expressive of the sentence: ""Ah, what more can we do?"" And it could always be seen that they were bewildered by the alleged news and could not fully compre- hend a defeat. Before the gray mists had been totally ob- literated by the sun rays, the regiment was march- ing in a spread column that was retiring carefully through the woods. The disordered, hurrying lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down through the groves and little fields. They were yelling, shrill and exultant. At this sight the youth forgot many personal matters and became greatly enraged. He ex- ploded in loud sentences. ""B'jiminey, we're generaled by a lot 'a lunkheads."" ""More than one feller has said that t'-day,"" observed a man. His friend, recently aroused, was still very drowsy. He looked behind him until his mind took in the meaning of the movement. Then he sighed. ""Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked,"" he remarked sadly. The youth had a thought that it would not be handsome for him to freely condemn other men. He made an attempt to restrain himself, but the words upon his tongue were too bitter. He presently began a long and intricate denunciation of the commander of the forces. ""Mebbe, it wa'n't all his fault--not all to- gether. He did th' best he knowed. It's our luck t' git licked often,"" said his friend in a weary tone. He was trudging along with stooped shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has been caned and kicked. ""Well, don't we fight like the devil? Don't we do all that men can?"" demanded the youth loudly. He was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment when it came from his lips. For a moment his face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about him. But no one questioned his right to deal in such words, and presently he recovered his air of courage. He went on to repeat a statement he had heard going from group to group at the camp that morning. ""The brigadier said he never saw a new reg'ment fight the way we fought yestirday, didn't he? And we didn't do better than many another reg'ment, did we? Well, then, you can't say it's th' army's fault, can you?"" In his reply, the friend's voice was stern. ""'A course not,"" he said. ""No man dare say we don't fight like th' devil. No man will ever dare say it. Th' boys fight like hell-roosters. But still--still, we don't have no luck."" ""Well, then, if we fight like the devil an' don't ever whip, it must be the general's fault,"" said the youth grandly and decisively. ""And I don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and fighting, yet always losing through some derned old lunkhead of a general."" A sarcastic man who was tramping at the youth's side, then spoke lazily. ""Mebbe yeh think yeh fit th' hull battle yestirday, Fleming,"" he remarked. The speech pierced the youth. Inwardly he was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance words. His legs quaked privately. He cast a frightened glance at the sarcastic man. ""Why, no,"" he hastened to say in a concili- ating voice, ""I don't think I fought the whole battle yesterday."" But the other seemed innocent of any deeper meaning. Apparently, he had no information. It was merely his habit. ""Oh!"" he replied in the same tone of calm derision. The youth, nevertheless, felt a threat. His mind shrank from going near to the danger, and thereafter he was silent. The significance of the sarcastic man's words took from him all loud moods that would make him appear prominent. He became suddenly a modest person. There was low-toned talk among the troops. The officers were impatient and snappy, their countenances clouded with the tales of misfor- tune. The troops, sifting through the forest, were sullen. In the youth's company once a man's laugh rang out. A dozen soldiers turned their faces quickly toward him and frowned with vague displeasure. The noise of firing dogged their footsteps. Sometimes, it seemed to be driven a little way, but it always returned again with increased insolence. The men muttered and cursed, throwing black looks in its direction. In a clear space the troops were at last halted. Regiments and brigades, broken and detached through their encounters with thickets, grew together again and lines were faced toward the pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry. This noise, following like the yellings of eager, metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings. The woods began to crackle as if afire. ""Whoop-a-dadee,"" said a man, ""here we are! Everybody fightin'. Blood an' destruction."" ""I was willin' t' bet they'd attack as soon as th' sun got fairly up,"" savagely asserted the lieutenant who commanded the youth's company. He jerked without mercy at his little mustache. He strode to and fro with dark dignity in the rear of his men, who were lying down behind whatever protection they had collected. A battery had trundled into position in the rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance. The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the moment when the gray shadows of the woods before them should be slashed by the lines of flame. There was much growling and swearing. ""Good Gawd,"" the youth grumbled, ""we're always being chased around like rats! It makes me sick. Nobody seems to know where we go or why we go. We just get fired around from pillar to post and get licked here and get licked there, and nobody knows what it's done for. It makes a man feel like a damn' kitten in a bag. Now, I'd like to know what the eternal thunders we was marched into these woods for anyhow,  THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE 161 unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot at us. We came in here and got our legs all tangled up in these cussed briers, and then we begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it. Don't tell me it's just luck! I know better. It's this derned old--"" The friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted his comrade with a voice of calm confidence. ""It'll turn out all right in th' end,"" he said. ""Oh, the devil it will! You always talk like a dog-hanged parson. Don't tell me! I know--"" At this time there was an interposition by the savage-minded lieutenant, who was obliged to vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his men. ""You boys shut right up! There no need 'a your wastin' your breath in long-winded arguments about this an' that an' th' other. You've been jawin' like a lot 'a old hens. All you've got t' do is to fight, an' you'll get plenty 'a that t' do in about ten minutes. Less talkin' an' more fightin' is what's best for you boys. I never saw sech gabbling jackasses."" He paused, ready to pounce upon any man who might have the temerity to reply. No words being said, he resumed his dignified pacing. ""There's too much chin music an' too little fightin' in this war, anyhow,"" he said to them, turning his head for a final remark. The day had grown more white, until the sun shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest. A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward that part of the line where lay the youth's regi- ment. The front shifted a trifle to meet it square- ly. There was a wait. In this part of the field there passed slowly the intense moments that pre- cede the tempest. A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the regiment. In an instant it was joined by many others. There was a mighty song of clashes and crashes that went sweeping through the woods. The guns in the rear, aroused and enraged by shells that had been thrown burlike at them, suddenly involved themselves in a hideous alter- cation with another band of guns. The battle roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a single, long explosion. In the regiment there was a peculiar kind of hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men. They were worn, exhausted, having slept but lit- tle and labored much. They rolled their eyes toward the advancing battle as they stood await- ing the shock. Some shrank and flinched. They stood as men tied to stakes. CHAPTER XVII.  THIS advance of the enemy had seemed to the youth like a ruthless hunting. He began to fume with rage and exasperation. He beat his foot upon the ground, and scowled with hate at the swirling smoke that was approaching like a phan- tom flood. There was a maddening quality in this seeming resolution of the foe to give him no rest, to give him no time to sit down and think. Yesterday he had fought and had fled rapidly. There had been many adventures. For to-day he felt that he had earned opportunities for contem- plative repose. He could have enjoyed portraying to uninitiated listeners various scenes at which he had been a witness or ably discussing the pro- cesses of war with other proved men. Too it was important that he should have time for physical recuperation. He was sore and stiff from his ex- periences. He had received his fill of all exer- tions, and he wished to rest. But those other men seemed never to grow weary; they were fighting with their old speed. 163 He had a wild hate for the relentless foe. Yester- day, when he had imagined the universe to be against him, he had hated it, little gods and big gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with the same great hatred. He was not going to be badgered of his life, like a kitten chased by boys, he said. It was not well to drive men into final corners; at those moments they could all develop teeth and claws. He leaned and spoke into his friend's ear. He menaced the woods with a gesture. ""If they keep on chasing us, by Gawd, they'd better watch out. Can't stand TOO much."" The friend twisted his head and made a calm reply. ""If they keep on a-chasin' us they'll drive us all inteh th' river."" The youth cried out savagely at this state- ment. He crouched behind a little tree, with his eyes burning hatefully and his teeth set in a cur- like snarl. The awkward bandage was still about his head, and upon it, over his wound, there was a spot of dry blood. His hair was wondrously tousled, and some straggling, moving locks hung over the cloth of the bandage down toward his forehead. His jacket and shirt were open at the throat, and exposed his young bronzed neck. There could be seen spasmodic gulpings at his throat. His fingers twined nervously about his rifle. He wished that it was an engine of annihilating power. He felt that he and his companions were being taunted and derided from sincere convic- tions that they were poor and puny. His knowl- edge of his inability to take vengeance for it made his rage into a dark and stormy specter, that pos- sessed him and made him dream of abominable cruelties. The tormentors were flies sucking in- solently at his blood, and he thought that he would have given his life for a revenge of seeing their faces in pitiful plights. The winds of battle had swept all about the regiment, until the one rifle, instantly followed by others, flashed in its front. A moment later the regiment roared forth its sudden and valiant re- tort. A dense wall of smoke settled slowly down. It was furiously slit and slashed by the knifelike fire from the rifles. To the youth the fighters resembled animals tossed for a death struggle into a dark pit. There was a sensation that he and his fellows, at bay, were pushing back, always pushing fierce on- slaughts of creatures who were slippery. Their beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon the bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade them with ease, and come through, between, around, and about with unopposed skill. When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth that his rifle was an impotent stick, he lost sense of everything but his hate, his desire to smash into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he could feel upon the faces of his enemies. The blue smoke-swallowed line curled and writhed like a snake stepped upon. It swung its ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage. The youth was not conscious that he was erect upon his feet. He did not know the direction of the ground. Indeed, once he even lost the habit of balance and fell heavily. He was up again immediately. One thought went through the chaos of his brain at the time. He wondered if he had fallen because he had been shot. But the suspicion flew away at once. He did not think more of it. He had taken up a first position behind the lit- tle tree, with a direct determination to hold it against the world. He had not deemed it possi- ble that his army could that day succeed, and from this he felt the ability to fight harder. But the throng had surged in all ways, until he lost directions and locations, save that he knew where lay the enemy. The flames bit him, and the hot smoke broiled his skin. His rifle barrel grew so hot that ordi- narily he could not have borne it upon his palms; but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it, and pounding them with his clanking, bending ram- rod. If he aimed at some changing form through the smoke, he pulled his trigger with a fierce grunt, as if he were dealing a blow of the fist with all his strength. When the enemy seemed falling back before him and his fellows, he went instantly forward, like a dog who, seeing his foes lagging, turns and insists upon being pursued. And when he was compelled to retire again, he did it slowly, sul- lenly, taking steps of wrathful despair. Once he, in his intent hate, was almost alone, and was firing, when all those near him had ceased. He was so engrossed in his occupation that he was not aware of a lull. He was recalled by a hoarse laugh and a sen- tence that came to his ears in a voice of contempt and amazement. ""Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t' shoot at? Good Gawd!"" He turned then and, pausing with his rifle thrown half into position, looked at the blue line of his comrades. During this moment of leisure they seemed all to be engaged in staring with astonishment at him. They had become specta- tors. Turning to the front again he saw, under the lifted smoke, a deserted ground. He looked bewildered for a moment. Then there appeared upon the glazed vacancy of his eyes a diamond point of intelligence. ""Oh,"" he said, comprehending. He returned to his comrades and threw him- self upon the ground. He sprawled like a man who had been thrashed. His flesh seemed strange- ly on fire, and the sounds of the battle continued in his ears. He groped blindly for his canteen. The lieutenant was crowing. He seemed drunk with fighting. He called out to the youth: ""By heavens, if I had ten thousand wild cats like you I could tear th' stomach outa this war in less'n a week!"" He puffed out his chest with large dignity as he said it. Some of the men muttered and looked at the youth in awe-struck ways. It was plain that as he had gone on loading and firing and cursing without the proper intermission, they had found time to regard him. And they now looked upon him as a war devil. The friend came staggering to him. There was some fright and dismay in his voice. ""Are yeh all right, Fleming? Do yeh feel all right? There ain't nothin' th' matter with yeh, Henry, is there?"" ""No,"" said the youth with difficulty. His throat seemed full of knobs and burs. These incidents made the youth ponder. It was revealed to him that he had been a barbarian, a beast. He had fought like a pagan who de- fends his religion. Regarding it, he saw that it was fine, wild, and, in some ways, easy. He had been a tremendous figure, no doubt. By this struggle he had overcome obstacles which he had admitted to be mountains. They had fallen like paper peaks, and he was now what he called a hero. And he had not been aware of the pro- cess. He had slept and, awakening, found him- self a knight. He lay and basked in the occasional stares of his comrades. Their faces were varied in de- grees of blackness from the burned powder. Some were utterly smudged. They were reek- ing with perspiration, and their breaths came hard and wheezing. And from these soiled ex- panses they peered at him. ""Hot work! Hot work!"" cried the lieu- tenant deliriously. He walked up and down, restless and eager. Sometimes his voice could be heard in a wild, incomprehensible laugh. When he had a particularly profound thought upon the science of war he always unconsciously addressed himself to the youth. There was some grim rejoicing by the men. ""By thunder, I bet this army'll never see another new reg'ment like us!"" ""You bet!"" ""A dog, a woman, an' a walnut tree,  Th' more yeh beat 'em, th' better they be! That's like us."" ""Lost a piler men, they did. If an' ol' woman swep' up th' woods she'd git a dustpanful."" ""Yes, an' if she'll come around ag'in in 'bout an' hour she'll git a pile more."" The forest still bore its burden of clamor. From off under the trees came the rolling clatter of the musketry. Each distant thicket seemed a strange porcupine with quills of flame. A cloud of dark smoke, as from smoldering ruins, went up toward the sun now bright and gay in the blue, enameled sky. "
The Jungle: Novel Summary Chapter II," begins by explaining how Jurgis is still young and optimistic, and talks lightly about work. He is also naïve and has never lived in a city before. He met Ona and her family in Lithuania and her father initially refused him permission to marry her. Jurgis went back to see her a year later to ask again only to find her father had died and the family were now impoverished. This family now consisted of Ona, Teta Elzbieta, her six children and Ona’s brother Jonas. They all believed that coming to the United States would give them freedom and more opportunities. Before they set off, and at the last moment, Marija also decides to join them. When they arrive in the Packingtown district in Chicago, the smell of the stockyards greets them first. They are almost penniless once they reach here after being taken advantage of in New York (as they are clearly immigrants and know no English). They all stay at Aniele Jukniene’s home as she takes in lodgers. This is already overcrowded and ‘unthinkably filthy’. There are lots of children in the area, but no school and there is a fetid odor because this part of town is built on the city dump. Despite these conditions, Ona and Jurgis look out at Packingtown in awe. ",The Jungle,Chapter II,"  Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he was young. They told him stories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of Chicago, and of what had happened to them afterward--stories to make your flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh. He had only been there four months, and he was young, and a giant besides. There was too much health in him. He could not even imagine how it would feel to be beaten. ""That is well enough for men like you,"" he would say, ""silpnas, puny fellows--but my back is broad."" Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. He was the sort of man the bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they cannot get hold of. When he was told to go to a certain place, he would go there on the run. When he had nothing to do for the moment, he would stand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was in him. If he were working in a line of men, the line always moved too slowly for him, and you could pick him out by his impatience and restlessness. That was why he had been picked out on one important occasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company's ""Central Time Station"" not more than half an hour, the second day of his arrival in Chicago, before he had been beckoned by one of the bosses. Of this he was very proud, and it made him more disposed than ever to laugh at the pessimists. In vain would they all tell him that there were men in that crowd from which he had been chosen who had stood there a month--yes, many months--and not been chosen yet. ""Yes,"" he would say, ""but what sort of men? Broken-down tramps and good- for-nothings, fellows who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more for it. Do you want me to believe that with these arms""--and he would clench his fists and hold them up in the air, so that you might see the rolling muscles--that with these arms people will ever let me starve?"" ""It is plain,"" they would answer to this, ""that you have come from the country, and from very far in the country."" And this was the fact, for Jurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town, until he had set out to make his fortune in the world and earn his right to Ona. His father, and his father's father before him, and as many ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of Lithuania known as Brelovicz, the Imperial Forest. This is a great tract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting preserve of the nobility. There are a very few peasants settled in it, holding title from ancient times; and one of these was Antanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his children in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness. There had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister. The former had been drafted into the army; that had been over ten years ago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him. The sister was married, and her husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go with his son. It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse fair a hundred miles from home. Jurgis had never expected to get married-- he had laughed at it as a foolish trap for a man to walk into; but here, without ever having spoken a word to her, with no more than the exchange of half a dozen smiles, he found himself, purple in the face with embarrassment and terror, asking her parents to sell her to him for his wife--and offering his father's two horses he had been sent to the fair to sell. But Ona's father proved as a rock--the girl was yet a child, and he was a rich man, and his daughter was not to be had in that way. So Jurgis went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and summer toiled and tried hard to forget. In the fall, after the harvest was over, he saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight's journey that lay between him and Ona. He found an unexpected state of affairs--for the girl's father had died, and his estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis' heart leaped as he realized that now the prize was within his reach. There was Elzbieta Lukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her, Ona's stepmother, and there were her six children, of all ages. There was also her brother Jonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm. They were people of great consequence, as it seemed to Jurgis, fresh out of the woods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he did not know, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was adrift--all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles which is half as many dollars. They would have had three times that, but it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and it had cost the balance to get him to change his decision. Ona might have married and left them, but she would not, for she loved Teta Elzbieta. It was Jonas who suggested that they all go to America, where a friend of his had gotten rich. He would work, for his part, and the women would work, and some of the children, doubtless--they would live somehow. Jurgis, too, had heard of America. That was a country where, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis figured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were where he lived, and decided forthwith that he would go to America and marry, and be a rich man in the bargain. In that country, rich or poor, a man was free, it was said; he did not have to go into the army, he did not have to pay out his money to rascally officials-- he might do as he pleased, and count himself as good as any other man. So America was a place of which lovers and young people dreamed. If one could only manage to get the price of a passage, he could count his troubles at an end. It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and meantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and tramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work upon a railroad in Smolensk. This was a fearful experience, with filth and bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out in fine trim, and with eighty rubles sewed up in his coat. He did not drink or fight, because he was thinking all the time of Ona; and for the rest, he was a quiet, steady man, who did what he was told to, did not lose his temper often, and when he did lose it made the offender anxious that he should not lose it again. When they paid him off he dodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill him; but he escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping always with one eye open. So in the summer time they had all set out for America. At the last moment there joined them Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona's. Marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer of Vilna, who beat her regularly. It was only at the age of twenty that it had occurred to Marija to try her strength, when she had risen up and nearly murdered the man, and then come away. There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children-- and Ona, who was a little of both. They had a hard time on the passage; there was an agent who helped them, but he proved a scoundrel, and got them into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of their precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear. This happened to them again in New York--for, of course, they knew nothing about the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel and keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away. The law says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not say that it shall be in Lithuanian.  It was in the stockyards that Jonas' friend had gotten rich, and so to Chicago the party was bound. They knew that one word, Chicago and that was all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city. Then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off than before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with its big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize that they had arrived, and why, when they said ""Chicago,"" people no longer pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or laughed, or went on without paying any attention. They were pitiable in their helplessness; above all things they stood in deadly terror of any sort of person in official uniform, and so whenever they saw a policeman they would cross the street and hurry by. For the whole of the first day they wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion, utterly lost; and it was only at night that, cowering in the doorway of a house, they were finally discovered and taken by a policeman to the station. In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken and put upon a car, and taught a new word--""stockyards."" Their delight at discovering that they were to get out of this adventure without losing another share of their possessions it would not be possible to describe. They sat and stared out of the window. They were on a street which seemed to run on forever, mile after mile--thirty-four of them, if they had known it--and each side of it one uninterrupted row of wretched little two-story frame buildings. Down every side street they could see, it was the same-- never a hill and never a hollow, but always the same endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings. Here and there would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with hard-baked mud shores and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a railroad crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing, and rattling freight cars filing by; here and there would be a great factory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it, and immense volumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and making filthy the earth beneath. But after each of these interruptions, the desolate procession would begin again--the procession of dreary little buildings. A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note the perplexing changes in the atmosphere. It grew darker all the time, and upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green. Every minute, as the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields were grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare. And along with the thickening smoke they began to notice another circumstance, a strange, pungent odor. They were not sure that it was unpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their taste in odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was curious. Now, sitting in the trolley car, they realized that they were on their way to the home of it--that they had traveled all the way from Lithuania to it. It was now no longer something far off and faint, that you caught in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell it--you could take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure. They were divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental odor, raw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong. There were some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put their handkerchiefs to their faces. The new emigrants were still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a halt, and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted--""Stockyards!"" They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street there were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very sky--and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and black as night. It might have come from the center of the world, this smoke, where the fires of the ages still smolder. It came as if self-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual explosion. It was inexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great streams rolled out. They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing, curling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach. Then the party became aware of another strange thing. This, too, like the color, was a thing elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of ten thousand little sounds. You scarcely noticed it at first--it sunk into your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble. It was like the murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest; it suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion. It was only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by animals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant grunting of ten thousand swine. They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for adventures just then. The policeman on the corner was beginning to watch them; and so, as usual, they started up the street. Scarcely had they gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry, and began pointing excitedly across the street. Before they could gather the meaning of his breathless ejaculations he had bounded away, and they saw him enter a shop, over which was a sign: ""J. Szedvilas, Delicatessen."" When he came out again it was in company with a very stout gentleman in shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both hands and laughing hilariously. Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly that Szedvilas had been the name of the mythical friend who had made his fortune in America. To find that he had been making it in the delicatessen business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at this juncture; though it was well on in the morning, they had not breakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper. Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage. The two families literally fell upon each other's necks--for it had been years since Jokubas Szedvilas had met a man from his part of Lithuania. Before half the day they were lifelong friends. Jokubas understood all the pitfalls of this new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he could tell them the things they ought to have done in the different emergencies--and what was still more to the point, he could tell them what to do now. He would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a boardinghouse the other side of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he explained, had not what one would call choice accommodations, but they might do for the moment. To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that nothing could be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite terrified over the sums they had had to expend. A very few days of practical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient to make clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high prices, and that in it the poor man was almost as poor as in any other corner of the earth; and so there vanished in a night all the wonderful dreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis. What had made the discovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American prices, money which they had earned at home rates of wages--and so were really being cheated by the world! The last two days they had all but starved themselves--it made them quite sick to pay the prices that the railroad people asked them for food. Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but recoil, even so. ln all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as this. Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one of that wilderness of two-story frame tenements that lie ""back of the yards."" There were four such flats in each building, and each of the four was a ""boardinghouse"" for the occupancy of foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or Bohemians. Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were cooperative. There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each room--sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or sixty to a flat. Each one of the occupants furnished his own accommodations--that is, a mattress and some bedding. The mattresses would be spread upon the floor in rows--and there would be nothing else in the place except a stove. It was by no means unusual for two men to own the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by night, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime. Very frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double shifts of men. Mrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face. Her home was unthinkably filthy; you could not enter by the front door at all, owing to the mattresses, and when you tried to go up the backstairs you found that she had walled up most of the porch with old boards to make a place to keep her chickens. It was a standing jest of the boarders that Aniele cleaned house by letting the chickens loose in the rooms. Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed probable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded it rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms. The truth was that she had definitely given up the idea of cleaning anything, under pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept her doubled up in one corner of her room for over a week; during which time eleven of her boarders, heavily in her debt, had concluded to try their chances of employment in Kansas City. This was July, and the fields were green. One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in Packingtown; but one could go out on the road and ""hobo it,"" as the men phrased it, and see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time riding on the freight cars. Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed. There was nothing better to be had--they might not do so well by looking further, for Mrs. Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her three little children, and now offered to share this with the women and the girls of the party. They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she explained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so hot-- doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this, as did nearly all of her guests. ""Tomorrow,"" Jurgis said, when they were left alone, ""tomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get one also; and then we can get a place of our own."" Later that afternoon he and Ona went out to take a walk and look about them, to see more of this district which was to be their home. In back of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther apart, and there were great spaces bare--that seemingly had been overlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the surface of the prairie. These bare places were grown up with dingy, yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children played upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and fighting. The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood--that there were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move faster than a walk! It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets. Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less than they did a miniature topographical map. The roadway was commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no pavements--there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water. In these pools the children played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here and there one noticed them digging in it, after trophies which they had stumbled on. One wondered about this, as also about the swarms of flies which hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the strange, fetid odor which assailed one's nostrils, a ghastly odor, of all the dead things of the universe. It impelled the visitor to questions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all this was ""made"" land, and that it had been ""made"" by using it as a dumping ground for the city garbage. After a few years the unpleasant effect of this would pass away, it was said; but meantime, in hot weather--and especially when it rained--the flies were apt to be annoying. Was it not unhealthful? the stranger would ask, and the residents would answer, ""Perhaps; but there is no telling."" A little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and wondering, came to the place where this ""made"" ground was in process of making. Here was a great hole, perhaps two city blocks square, and with long files of garbage wagons creeping into it. The place had an odor for which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with children, who raked in it from dawn till dark. Sometimes visitors from the packing houses would wander out to see this ""dump,"" and they would stand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the food they got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home. Apparently none of them ever went down to find out. Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys. First they took out the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it up again with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis and Ona a felicitous arrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America. A little way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and not yet filled up. This held water, and all summer it stood there, with the near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun; and then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to the people of the city. This, too, seemed to the newcomers an economical arrangement; for they did not read the newspapers, and their heads were not full of troublesome thoughts about ""germs."" They stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky in the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like fire. Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset, however--their backs were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown, which they could see so plainly in the distance. The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world. It was a study in colors now, this smoke; in the sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple. All the sordid suggestions of the place were gone--in the twilight it was a vision of power. To the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things being done, of employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy. When they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, ""Tomorrow I shall go there and get a job!""  "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 24-25,"  Dante is deeply discouraged by seeing Virgil so upset, but Virgil recovers as soon as they reach the place where they have to climb, and turns to Dante ""with that sweet look that I first saw at the foot of the mountain"" (lines 20-21), back in the Dark Wood. Once again he picks Dante up and lifts him high enough that he can climb on his own, with Virgil's help. It's the hardest climb they've had yet, and Dante sits down exhausted at the top, but Virgil urges him on. Sloth won't win him fame. And Dante pulls himself together and goes on. They go over the next high, narrow bridge, but can only see the souls down in the ditch (the Seventh Bolgia) when they come to the other side. There they see shades tormented by serpents. As they watch, one soul is bitten by a serpent, dissolves into ash, and then re-forms. It turns out to be a notorious plunderer and thief named Vanni Fucci, who is so ashamed to have Dante see him here that he foretells the coming victory of the Blacks in Florence, just to wound Dante. When he has finished speaking, the thief lifts up both his hands in the obscene gesture called the fig (the fingers in a fist, the thumb thrust through between the index and second finger), defying God. Two serpents choke him and bind his hands, and he goes off. A centaur named Cacus, known for his thievery, pursues him. Three more spirits come in sight, and Dante and Virgil watch as they change shapes with each other, one becoming a serpent. Analysis Subtle thieves, who operate by deception, are worse in Dante's scheme of things that open robbers, and they are aptly tormented by creeping serpents. As they did not allow others to call their property their own, so now they cannot call their bodies their own. The absurdity of the pride that resists and defies God, who is Reality itself, becomes more and more obvious. Farinata one can see as noble; Capaneus is, as Virgil points out, torturing himself with his defiance; and what could be more ludicrous than making an obscene gesture at God? ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 24-25," 1. The Seventh Bolgia, in which Thieves are punished. 2. The sun enters Aquarius during the last half of January, when the Equinox is near, and the hoar-frost in the morning looks like snow on the fields, but soon evaporates. If Dante had been a monk of Monte Casino, illuminating a manuscript, he could not have made a more clerkly and scholastic flourish with his pen than this, nor have painted a more beautiful picture than that which follows. The mediaeval poets are full of lovely descriptions of Spring, which seems to blossom and sing through all their verses; but none is more beautiful or suggestive than this, though serving only as an illustration. 21. In Canto I. 43. See what Mr. Ruskin says of Dante as ""a notably bad climber,"" Canto XII. Note 2. 55. The ascent of the Mount of Purgatory. 73. The next circular dike, dividing the fosses. 86. This list of serpents is from Lucan, Phars. IX. 711, Rowe's Tr. :--  ""Slimy Chelyders the parched earth distain And trace a reeking furrow on the plain. The spotted Cenchris, rich in various dyes, Shoots in a line, and forth directly flies.  The Swimmer there the crystal stream pollutes, And swift thro' air the flying Javelin shoots.  The Amphisbaena doubly armed appears At either end a threatening head she rears; Raised on his active tail Pareas stands, And as he passes, furrows up the sands."" Milton, Parad. Lost, X. 521:--  ""Dreadful was the din Of hissing through the hall, thick-swarming now With complicated monsters head and tail, Scorpion, and asp, and amphisbaena dire, Cerastes horned, hydrus, and elops drear, And dipsas."" Of the Phareas, Peter Comestor, Hist. Scholast., Gloss of Genesis iii. 1, says: ""And this he (Lucifer) did by means of the serpent; for then it was erect like man; being afterwards made prostrate by the curse; and it is said the Phareas walks erect even to this day."" Of the Amphisbaena, Brunetto Latini, Tresor I. v. 140, says: ""The Amphimenie is a kind of serpent which has two heads; one in its right place, and the other in the tail; and with each she can bite; and she runs swiftly, and her eyes shine like candles."" 93. Without a hiding-place, or the heliotrope, a precious stone of great virtue against poisons, and supposed to render the wearer invisible. Upon this latter vulgar error is founded Boccaccio's comical story of Calandrino and his friends Bruno and Buffulmacco, Decam., Gior. VIII., Nov. 3. 107. Brunetto Latini, Tresor I. v. 164, says of the Phoenix: ""He goeth to a good tree, savory and of good odor, and maketh a pile thereof, to which he setteth fire, and entereth straightway into it toward the rising of the sun."" And Milton, Samson Agonistes, 1697:  ""So Virtue, given for lost, Depressed and overthrown, as seemed, Like that self-begotten bird In the Arabian woods embost, That no second knows nor third, And lay erewhile a holocaust, From out her ashy womb now teemed, Revives, reflourishes, then vigorous most When most unactive deemed; And, though her body die, her fame survives A secular bird ages of lives."" 114. Any obstruction, ""such as the epilepsy,"" says Benvenuto. ""Gouts and dropsies, catarrhs and oppilations,"" says Jeremy Taylor. 125. Vanni Fucci, who calls himself a mule, was a bastard son of Fuccio de' Lazzari. All the commentators paint him in the darkest colors. Dante had known him as ""a man of blood and wrath,"" and seems to wonder he is here, and not in the circle of the Violent, or of the Irascible. But his great crime was the robbery of a sacristy. Benvenuto da Imola relates the story in detail. He speaks of him as a man of depraved life, many of whose misdeeds went unpunished, because he was of noble family. Being banished from Pistoia for his crimes, he returned to the city one night of the Carnival, and was in company with eighteen other revellers, among whom was Vanni della Nona, a notary; when, not content with their insipid diversions, he stole away with two companions to the church of San Giacomo, and, finding its custodians absent, or asleep with feasting and drinking, he entered the sacristy and robbed it of all its precious jewels. These he secreted in the house of the notary, which was close at hand, thinking that on account of his honest repute no suspicion would fall upon him. A certain Rampino was arrested for the theft, and put to the torture; when Vanni Fucci, having escaped to Monte Carelli, beyond the Florentine jurisdiction, sent a messenger to Rampino's father, confessing all the circumstances of the crime. Hereupon the notary was seized ""on the first Monday in Lent, as he was going to a sermon in the church of the Minorite Friars,"" and was hanged for the theft, and Rampino set at liberty. No one has a good word to say for Vanni Fucci, except the Canonico Crescimbeni, who, in the Comentarj to the Istoria della Volg. Poesia, II. ii., p. 99, counts him among the Italian Poets, and speaks of him as a man of great courage and gallantry, and a leader of the Neri party of Pistoia, in 1300. He smooths over Dante's invectives by remarking that Dante ""makes not too honorable mention of him in the Comedy""; and quotes a sonnet of his, which is pathetic from its utter despair and self-reproach:--  ""For I have lost the good I might have had Through little wit, and not of mine own will."" It is like the wail of a lost soul, and the same in tone as the words which Dante here puts into his mouth. Dante may have heard him utter similar self-accusations while living, and seen on his face the blush of shame, which covers it here. 143. The Neri were banished from Pistoia in 1301; the Bianchi, from Florence in 1302. 145. This vapor or lightning flash from Val di Magra is the Marquis Malaspini, and the ""turbid clouds"" are the banished Neri of Pistoia, whom he is to gather about him to defeat the Bianchi at Campo Piceno, the old battle-field of Catiline. As Dante was of the Bianchi party, this prophecy of impending disaster and overthrow could only give him pain. See Canto VI. Note 65. "
"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Queer"," Elmer Cowley is the son of Ebenezer Cowley, a farmer who sold his farm a year ago and became a storekeeper. Ebenezer is not much of a merchant, as he just buys up a jumble of things that cannot really be sold. One time, Elmer threatens a merchant who tries to sell them an item they will never be able to sell again. He is bitter that his family is so odd and he thinks that everyone in the town laughs at them because of it. He takes a walk and tries to talk to a simple-minded man who remained on the Cowley farm, but he is unable to communicate his frustration. When he sees George Willard happen to look at him, Elmer flies into a rage, thinking the reporter is considering how odd the Cowleys are. Yet, when he confronts George, he cannot find words to tell him how he feels and just sputters with anger. He steals $20 from his father to take the local train to the city, where he plans to join the anonymous rush of people. He wakes up George and tells him to come down to the station, intending to tell the young man that he is not strange. Again, words fail him, and he gives George the $20 to return to his father and then beats up George before jumping on the train. Analysis Elmer believes that ""George Willard. belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town.. Did he not represent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness?"" (195). George is again thought to represent the town because he is the reporter, collecting the stories of everyone in town. For Elmer, making himself understood to George would vindicate him in the eyes of the town. He wants to be considered normal, to blend into a crowd, which is why he is going to the big city, where he expects to disappear into anonymity. However, even in the big city, there is loneliness. Elmer is lonely in a small town because he stands out, but Enoch was lonely in a big city where he blended in. The characters hope that moving from one place to another will give them a chance to make a meaningful connection with another person. This is why trains are so prominent in this book. Travel is a modern condition, in which people can leave small towns or cities easily. However, they cannot flee the essential human condition of loneliness, which just takes different forms in different settings. ","Winesburg, Ohio",Queer," FROM HIS SEAT on a box in the rough board shed that stuck like a burr on the rear of Cowley & Son's store in Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the junior member of the firm, could see through a dirty window into the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle. Elmer was putting new shoelaces in his shoes. They did not go in readily and he had to take the shoes off. With the shoes in his hand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel of one of his stockings. Then looking quickly up he saw George Willard, the only newspa- per reporter in Winesburg, standing at the back door of the Eagle printshop and staring absentmindedly about. ""Well, well, what next!"" exclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand, jumping to his feet and creeping away from the window. A flush crept into Elmer Cowley's face and his hands began to tremble. In Cowley & Son's store a Jewish traveling salesman stood by the counter talk- ing to his father. He imagined the reporter could hear what was being said and the thought made him furious. With one of the shoes still held in his hand he stood in a corner of the shed and stamped with a stockinged foot upon the board floor. Cowley & Son's store did not face the main street of Winesburg. The front was on Maumee Street and beyond it was Voight's wagon shop and a shed for the sheltering of farmers' horses. Beside the store an alleyway ran behind the main street stores and all day drays and delivery wagons, intent on bringing in and taking out goods, passed up and down. The store itself was indescribable. Will Henderson once said of it that it sold everything and nothing. In the window facing Maumee Street stood a chunk of coal as large as an apple barrel, to indicate that orders for coal were taken, and beside the black mass of the coal stood three combs of honey grown brown and dirty in their wooden frames. The honey had stood in the store window for six months. It was for sale as were also the coat hang- ers, patent suspender buttons, cans of roof paint, bottles of rheumatism cure, and a substitute for cof- fee that companioned the honey in its patient will- ingness to serve the public. Ebenezer Cowley, the man who stood in the store listening to the eager patter of words that fell from the lips of the traveling man, was tall and lean and looked unwashed. On his scrawny neck was a large wen partially covered by a grey beard. He wore a long Prince Albert coat. The coat had been pur- chased to serve as a wedding garment. Before he became a merchant Ebenezer was a farmer and after his marriage he wore the Prince Albert coat to church on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons when he came into town to trade. When he sold the farm to become a merchant he wore the coat constantly. It had become brown with age and was covered with grease spots, but in it Ebenezer always felt dressed up and ready for the day in town. As a merchant Ebenezer was not happily placed in life and he had not been happily placed as a farmer. Still he existed. His family, consisting of a daughter named Mabel and the son, lived with him in rooms above the store and it did not cost them much to live. His troubles were not financial. His unhappiness as a merchant lay in the fact that when a traveling man with wares to be sold came in at the front door he was afraid. Behind the counter he stood shaking his head. He was afraid, first that he would stubbornly refuse to buy and thus lose the opportunity to sell again; second that he would not be stubborn enough and would in a moment of weakness buy what could not be sold. In the store on the morning when Elmer Cowley saw George Willard standing and apparently lis- tening at the back door of the Eagle printshop, a situation had arisen that always stirred the son's wrath. The traveling man talked and Ebenezer lis- tened, his whole figure expressing uncertainty. ""You see how quickly it is done,"" said the traveling man, who had for sale a small flat metal substitute for collar buttons. With one hand he quickly unfastened a collar from his shirt and then fastened it on again. He assumed a flattering wheedling tone. ""I tell you what, men have come to the end of all this fooling with collar buttons and you are the man to make money out of the change that is coming. I am offer- ing you the exclusive agency for this town. Take twenty dozen of these fasteners and I'll not visit any other store. I'll leave the field to you."" The traveling man leaned over the counter and tapped with his finger on Ebenezer's breast. ""It's an opportunity and I want you to take it,"" he urged. ""A friend of mine told me about you. 'See that man Cowley,' he said. 'He's a live one.'"" The traveling man paused and waited. Taking a book from his pocket he began writing out the order. Still holding the shoe in his hand Elmer Cow- ley went through the store, past the two absorbed men, to a glass showcase near the front door. He took a cheap revolver from the case and began to wave it about. ""You get out of here!"" he shrieked. ""We don't want any collar fasteners here."" An idea came to him. ""Mind, I'm not making any threat,"" he added. ""I don't say I'll shoot. Maybe I just took this gun out of the case to look at it. But you better get out. Yes sir, I'll say that. You better grab up your things and get out."" The young storekeeper's voice rose to a scream and going behind the counter he began to advance upon the two men. ""We're through being fools here!"" he cried. ""We ain't going to buy any more stuff until we begin to sell. We ain't going to keep on being queer and have folks staring and listening. You get out of here!"" The traveling man left. Raking the samples of col- lar fasteners off the counter into a black leather bag, he ran. He was a small man and very bow-legged and he ran awkwardly. The black bag caught against the door and he stumbled and fell. ""Crazy, that's what he is--crazy!"" he sputtered as he arose from the sidewalk and hurried away. In the store Elmer Cowley and his father stared at each other. Now that the immediate object of his wrath had fled, the younger man was embarrassed. ""Well, I meant it. I think we've been queer long enough,"" he declared, going to the showcase and replacing the revolver. Sitting on a barrel he pulled on and fastened the shoe he had been holding in his hand. He was waiting for some word of under- standing from his father but when Ebenezer spoke his words only served to reawaken the wrath in the son and the young man ran out of the store without replying. Scratching his grey beard with his long dirty fingers, the merchant looked at his son with the same wavering uncertain stare with which he had confronted the traveling man. ""I'll be starched,"" he said softly. ""Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed and starched!"" Elmer Cowley went out of Winesburg and along a country road that paralleled the railroad track. He did not know where he was going or what he was going to do. In the shelter of a deep cut where the road, after turning sharply to the right, dipped under the tracks he stopped and the passion that had been the cause of his outburst in the store began to again find expression. ""I will not be queer--one to be looked at and listened to,"" he declared aloud. ""I'll be like other people. I'll show that George Wil- lard. He'll find out. I'll show him!"" The distraught young man stood in the middle of the road and glared back at the town. He did not know the reporter George Willard and had no spe- cial feeling concerning the tall boy who ran about town gathering the town news. The reporter had merely come, by his presence in the office and in the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle, to stand for something in the young merchant's mind. He thought the boy who passed and repassed Cowley & Son's store and who stopped to talk to people in the street must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him. George Willard, he felt, belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town. Elmer Cowley could not have believed that George Willard had also his days of unhappiness, that vague hungers and secret unnam- able desires visited also his mind. Did he not repre- sent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness? Did he not walk whistling and laughing through Main Street? Might not one by striking his person strike also the greater enemy--the thing that smiled and went its own way--the judgment of Winesburg? Elmer Cowley was extraordinarily tall and his arms were long and powerful. His hair, his eye- brows, and the downy beard that had begun to grow upon his chin, were pale almost to whiteness. His teeth protruded from between his lips and his eyes were blue with the colorless blueness of the marbles called ""aggies"" that the boys of Winesburg carried in their pockets. Elmer had lived in Wines- burg for a year and had made no friends. He was, he felt, one condemned to go through life without friends and he hated the thought. Sullenly the tall young man tramped along the road with his hands stuffed into his trouser pockets. The day was cold with a raw wind, but presently the sun began to shine and the road became soft and muddy. The tops of the ridges of frozen mud that formed the road began to melt and the mud clung to Elmer's shoes. His feet became cold. When he had gone several miles he turned off the road, crossed a field and entered a wood. In the wood he gathered sticks to build a fire, by which he sat trying to warm himself, miserable in body and in mind. For two hours he sat on the log by the fire and then, arising and creeping cautiously through a mass of underbrush, he went to a fence and looked across fields to a small farmhouse surrounded by low sheds. A smile came to his lips and he began making motions with his long arms to a man who was husking corn in one of the fields. In his hour of misery the young merchant had returned to the farm where he had lived through boyhood and where there was another human being to whom he felt he could explain himself. The man on the farm was a half-witted old fellow named Mook. He had once been employed by Ebenezer Cowley and had stayed on the farm when it was sold. The old man lived in one of the unpainted sheds back of the farmhouse and puttered about all day in the fields. Mook the half-wit lived happily. With childlike faith he believed in the intelligence of the animals that lived in the sheds with him, and when he was lonely held long conversations with the cows, the pigs, and even with the chickens that ran about the barnyard. He it was who had put the expression regarding being ""laundered"" into the mouth of his former employer. When excited or surprised by any- thing he smiled vaguely and muttered: ""I'll be washed and ironed. Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed and starched."" When the half-witted old man left his husking of corn and came into the wood to meet Elmer Cowley, he was neither surprised nor especially interested in the sudden appearance of the young man. His feet also were cold and he sat on the log by the fire, grateful for the warmth and apparently indifferent to what Elmer had to say. Elmer talked earnestly and with great freedom, walking up and down and waving his arms about. ""You don't understand what's the matter with me so of course you don't care,"" he declared. ""With me it's different. Look how it has always been with me. Father is queer and mother was queer, too. Even the clothes mother used to wear were not like other people's clothes, and look at that coat in which fa- ther goes about there in town, thinking he's dressed up, too. Why don't he get a new one? It wouldn't cost much. I'll tell you why. Father doesn't know and when mother was alive she didn't know either. Mabel is different. She knows but she won't say anything. I will, though. I'm not going to be stared at any longer. Why look here, Mook, father doesn't know that his store there in town is just a queer jumble, that he'll never sell the stuff he buys. He knows nothing about it. Sometimes he's a little wor- ried that trade doesn't come and then he goes and buys something else. In the evenings he sits by the fire upstairs and says trade will come after a while. He isn't worried. He's queer. He doesn't know enough to be worried."" The excited young man became more excited. ""He don't know but I know,"" he shouted, stopping to gaze down into the dumb, unresponsive face of the half-wit. ""I know too well. I can't stand it. When we lived out here it was different. I worked and at night I went to bed and slept. I wasn't always seeing people and thinking as I am now. In the evening, there in town, I go to the post office or to the depot to see the train come in, and no one says anything to me. Everyone stands around and laughs and they talk but they say nothing to me. Then I feel so queer that I can't talk either. I go away. I don't say any- thing. I can't."" The fury of the young man became uncontrollable. ""I won't stand it,"" he yelled, looking up at the bare branches of the trees. ""I'm not made to stand it."" Maddened by the dull face of the man on the log by the fire, Elmer turned and glared at him as he had glared back along the road at the town of Winesburg. ""Go on back to work,"" he screamed. ""What good does it do me to talk to you?"" A thought came to him and his voice dropped. ""I'm a coward too, eh?"" he muttered. ""Do you know why I came clear out here afoot? I had to tell someone and you were the only one I could tell. I hunted out another queer one, you see. I ran away, that's what I did. I couldn't stand up to someone like that George Willard. I had to come to you. I ought to tell him and I will."" Again his voice arose to a shout and his arms flew about. ""I will tell him. I won't be queer. I don't care what they think. I won't stand it."" Elmer Cowley ran out of the woods leaving the half-wit sitting on the log before the fire. Presently the old man arose and climbing over the fence went back to his work in the corn. ""I'll be washed and ironed and starched,"" he declared. ""Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed."" Mook was interested. He went along a lane to a field where two cows stood nibbling at a straw stack. ""Elmer was here,"" he said to the cows. ""Elmer is crazy. You better get behind the stack where he don't see you. He'll hurt some- one yet, Elmer will."" At eight o'clock that evening Elmer Cowley put his head in at the front door of the office of the Winesburg Eagle where George Willard sat writing. His cap was pulled down over his eyes and a sullen determined look was on his face. ""You come on out- side with me,"" he said, stepping in and closing the door. He kept his hand on the knob as though pre- pared to resist anyone else coming in. ""You just come along outside. I want to see you."" George Willard and Elmer Cowley walked through the main street of Winesburg. The night was cold and George Willard had on a new overcoat and looked very spruce and dressed up. He thrust his hands into the overcoat pockets and looked inquir- ingly at his companion. He had long been wanting to make friends with the young merchant and find out what was in his mind. Now he thought he saw a chance and was delighted. ""I wonder what he's up to? Perhaps he thinks he has a piece of news for the paper. It can't be a fire because I haven't heard the fire bell and there isn't anyone running,"" he thought. In the main street of Winesburg, on the cold No- vember evening, but few citizens appeared and these hurried along bent on getting to the stove at the back of some store. The windows of the stores were frosted and the wind rattled the tin sign that hung over the entrance to the stairway leading to Doctor Welling's office. Before Hern's Grocery a bas- ket of apples and a rack filled with new brooms stood on the sidewalk. Elmer Cowley stopped and stood facing George Willard. He tried to talk and his arms began to pump up and down. His face worked spasmodically. He seemed about to shout. ""Oh, you go on back,"" he cried. ""Don't stay out here with me. I ain't got anything to tell you. I don't want to see you at all."" For three hours the distracted young merchant wandered through the resident streets of Winesburg blind with anger, brought on by his failure to declare his determination not to be queer. Bitterly the sense of defeat settled upon him and he wanted to weep. After the hours of futile sputtering at nothingness that had occupied the afternoon and his failure in the presence of the young reporter, he thought he could see no hope of a future for himself. And then a new idea dawned for him. In the dark- ness that surrounded him he began to see a light. Going to the now darkened store, where Cowley & Son had for over a year waited vainly for trade to come, he crept stealthily in and felt about in a barrel that stood by the stove at the rear. In the barrel beneath shavings lay a tin box containing Cowley & Son's cash. Every evening Ebenezer Cowley put the box in the barrel when he closed the store and went upstairs to bed. ""They wouldn't never think of a careless place like that,"" he told himself, thinking of robbers. Elmer took twenty dollars, two ten-dollar bills, from the little roll containing perhaps four hundred dollars, the cash left from the sale of the farm. Then replacing the box beneath the shavings he went qui- etly out at the front door and walked again in the streets. The idea that he thought might put an end to all of his unhappiness was very simple. ""I will get out of here, run away from home,"" he told himself. He knew that a local freight train passed through Winesburg at midnight and went on to Cleveland, where it arrived at dawn. He would steal a ride on the local and when he got to Cleveland would lose himself in the crowds there. He would get work in some shop and become friends with the other workmen and would be indistinguishable. Then he could talk and laugh. He would no longer be queer and would make friends. Life would begin to have warmth and meaning for him as it had for others. The tall awkward young man, striding through the streets, laughed at himself because he had been angry and had been half afraid of George Willard. He decided he would have his talk with the young reporter before he left town, that he would tell him about things, perhaps challenge him, challenge all of Winesburg through him. Aglow with new confidence Elmer went to the office of the New Willard House and pounded on the door. A sleep-eyed boy slept on a cot in the office. He received no salary but was fed at the hotel table and bore with pride the title of ""night clerk."" Before the boy Elmer was bold, insistent. ""You 'wake him up,"" he commanded. ""You tell him to come down by the depot. I got to see him and I'm going away on the local. Tell him to dress and come on down. I ain't got much time."" The midnight local had finished its work in Wines- burg and the trainsmen were coupling cars, swing- ing lanterns and preparing to resume their flight east. George Willard, rubbing his eyes and again wearing the new overcoat, ran down to the station platform afire with curiosity. ""Well, here I am. What do you want? You've got something to tell me, eh?"" he said. Elmer tried to explain. He wet his lips with his tongue and looked at the train that had begun to groan and get under way. ""Well, you see,"" he began, and then lost control of his tongue. ""I'll be washed and ironed. I'll be washed and ironed and starched,"" he muttered half incoherently. Elmer Cowley danced with fury beside the groan- ing train in the darkness on the station platform. Lights leaped into the air and bobbed up and down before his eyes. Taking the two ten-dollar bills from his pocket he thrust them into George Willard's hand. ""Take them,"" he cried. ""I don't want them. Give them to father. I stole them."" With a snarl of rage he turned and his long arms began to flay the air. Like one struggling for release from hands that held him he struck out, hitting George Willard blow after blow on the breast, the neck, the mouth. The young reporter rolled over on the platform half un- conscious, stunned by the terrific force of the blows. Springing aboard the passing train and running over the tops of cars, Elmer sprang down to a flat car and lying on his face looked back, trying to see the fallen man in the darkness. Pride surged up in him. ""I showed him,"" he cried. ""I guess I showed him. I ain't so queer. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer."" "

",The Count of Monte Cristo,Chapter 51-55," The Morrel Family. In a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The house was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small beds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate the count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye had become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not recognize the count. The carriages that drove up to the door were compelled to turn, to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork, -- an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole quarter, and had gained for the place the appellation of ""The Little Versailles."" It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish in the basin. The house, with kitchens and cellars below, had above the ground-floor, two stories and attics. The whole of the property, consisting of an immense workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of the garden, and the garden itself, had been purchased by Emmanuel, who had seen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation. He had reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between the garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the garden. So that for a trifling sum he was as well lodged, and as perfectly shut out from observation, as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain. The breakfast-room was finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the furnishings were of blue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask. There was a study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a music-room for Julie, who never played. The whole of the second story was set apart for Maximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister's apartments, except that for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room, where he received his friends. He was superintending the grooming of his horse, and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the count's carriage stopped at the gate. Cocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired whether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel would see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo. "" ?"" cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and hastening to the carriage; ""I should think we would see him. Ah, a thousand thanks, count, for not having forgotten your promise."" And the young officer shook the count's hand so warmly, that Monte Cristo could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw that he had been expected with impatience, and was received with pleasure. ""Come, come,"" said Maximilian, ""I will serve as your guide; such a man as you are ought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the garden plucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers, the Presse and the Debats, within six steps of her; for wherever you see Madame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four yards and you will find M. Emmanuel, and `reciprocally,' as they say at the Polytechnic School."" At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty to five and twenty, dressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head. This was Julie, who had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson & French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh. ""Don't disturb yourself, Julie,"" said he. ""The count has only been two or three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of the Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him."" ""Ah, monsieur,"" returned Julie, ""it is treason in my brother to bring you thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon, Penelon!"" An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck his spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of gray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his bronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics. ""I think you hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?"" said he. Penelon had still preserved the habit of calling his master's daughter ""Mademoiselle Julie,"" and had never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault. ""Penelon,"" replied Julie, ""go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman's visit, and Maximilian will conduct him to the salon."" Then, turning to Monte Cristo, -- ""I hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,"" continued she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a clump of trees, and escaped to the house by a lateral alley. ""I am sorry to see,"" observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, ""that I cause no small disturbance in your house."" ""Look there,"" said Maximilian, laughing; ""there is her husband changing his jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue Meslay."" ""Your family appears to be a very happy one,"" said the count, as if speaking to himself. ""Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them happy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each other, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves as rich as Rothschild."" ""Five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,"" replied Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to Maximilian's heart like the voice of a father; ""but they will not be content with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?"" ""He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my poor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were divided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children. Her husband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble probity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to possess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he had amassed 250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object. Oh, I assure you, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures, destined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous people would have effected in two or three. Marseilles resounded with their well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife, who had just finished making up the accounts. `Julie,' said he to her, `Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that completes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains. Can you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess for the future? Listen to me. Our house transacts business to the amount of a million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs. We can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have received a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase the good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs. Advise me what I had better do.' -- `Emmanuel,' returned my sister, `the house of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth 300,000 francs to save our father's name from the chances of evil fortune and failure?' -- `I thought so,' replied Emmanuel; `but I wished to have your advice.' -- `This is my counsel: -- Our accounts are made up and our bills paid; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more, and close our office.' This was done instantly. It was three o'clock; at a quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was a clear profit of 15,000 francs. `Monsieur,' said Emmanuel, `have the goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay. We have quitted business.' -- `How long?' inquired the astonished merchant. `A quarter of an hour,' was the reply. And this is the reason, monsieur,"" continued Maximilian, ""of my sister and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a year."" Maximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count's heart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and coat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the rank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little garden, he returned to the house. A large vase of Japan porcelain, filled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in the salon. Julie, suitably dressed, and her hair arranged (she had accomplished this feat in less than ten minutes), received the count on his entrance. The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by, and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains. Everything in this charming retreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress, breathed tranquillity and repose. The count had felt the influence of this happiness from the moment he entered the house, and he remained silent and pensive, forgetting that he was expected to renew the conversation, which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged. The silence became almost painful when, by a violent effort, tearing himself from his pleasing reverie -- ""Madame,"" said he at length, ""I pray you to excuse my emotion, which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the happiness I meet here; but contentment is so new a sight to me, that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your husband."" ""We are very happy, monsieur,"" replied Julie; ""but we have also known unhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves."" The Count's features displayed an expression of the most intense curiosity. ""Oh, all this is a family history, as Chateau-Renaud told you the other day,"" observed Maximilian. ""This humble picture would have but little interest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the misfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have experienced bitter sorrows."" ""And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all who are in affliction?"" said Monte Cristo inquiringly. ""Yes, count,"" returned Julie, ""we may indeed say he has, for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his angels."" The count's cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth. ""Those born to wealth, and who have the means of gratifying every wish,"" said Emmanuel, ""know not what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been tossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather."" Monte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness of his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the apartment with a slow step. ""Our magnificence makes you smile, count,"" said Maximilian, who had followed him with his eyes. ""No, no,"" returned Monte Cristo, pale as death, pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings, while with the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion. ""I was wondering what could be the significance of this purse, with the paper at one end and the large diamond at the other."" ""Count,"" replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, ""those are our most precious family treasures."" ""The stone seems very brilliant,"" answered the count. ""Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been estimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now."" ""This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation, madame,"" replied Monte Cristo bowing. ""Pardon me, I had no intention of committing an indiscretion."" ""Indiscretion, -- oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh, would we could relate it everywhere, and to every one, so that the emotion of our unknown benefactor might reveal his presence."" ""Ah, really,"" said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice. ""Monsieur,"" returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and respectfully kissing the silken purse, ""this has touched the hand of a man who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from shame and disgrace, -- a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor children, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear every one envying our happy lot. This letter"" (as he spoke, Maximilian drew a letter from the purse and gave it to the count) -- ""this letter was written by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution, and this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry."" Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an indescribable feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our readers know) to Julie, and signed ""Sinbad the Sailor."" ""Unknown you say, is the man who rendered you this service -- unknown to you?"" ""Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,"" continued Maximilian. ""We have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend -- we have been guided by an invisible hand, -- a hand as powerful as that of an enchanter."" ""Oh,"" cried Julie, ""I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that hand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago, Penelon was at Trieste -- Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the garden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener -- Penelon, when he was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point of embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person who called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this letter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but he did not venture to address him."" ""An Englishman,"" said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention with which Julie looked at him. ""An Englishman you say?"" ""Yes,"" replied Maximilian, ""an Englishman, who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It was this that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf's, that Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That happened, as I told you, in 1829. For God's sake, tell me, did you know this Englishman?"" ""But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have constantly denied having rendered you this service?"" ""Yes."" ""Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be some one who, grateful for a kindness your father had shown him, Back to Full Books byAlexandre Dumas [Pere] and which he himself had forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?"" ""Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle."" ""What was his name?"" asked Monte Cristo. ""He gave no other name,"" answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count, ""than that at the end of his letter -- `Sinbad the Sailor.'"" ""Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one."" Then, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice, -- ""Tell me,"" continued he, ""was he not about my height, perhaps a little taller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat closely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?"" ""Oh, do you then know him?"" cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy. ""No,"" returned Monte Cristo ""I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who was constantly doing actions of this kind."" ""Without revealing himself?"" ""He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of gratitude."" ""Oh, heaven,"" exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, ""in what did he believe, then?"" ""He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,"" said Monte Cristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie's voice; ""but, perhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist."" ""And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?"" inquired Emmanuel. ""Oh, if you do know him,"" cried Julie, ""can you tell us where he is -- where we can find him? Maximilian -- Emmanuel -- if we do but discover him, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!"" Monte Cristo felt tears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the room. ""In the name of heaven,"" said Maximilian, ""if you know anything of him, tell us what it is."" ""Alas,"" cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, ""if Lord Wilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him again. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on the point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he will never return."" ""Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,"" said Julie, much affected; and the young lady's eyes swam with tears. ""Madame,"" replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down Julie's cheeks, ""had Lord Wilmore seen what I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed would reconcile him to mankind;"" and he held out his hand to Julie, who gave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count. ""But,"" continued she, ""Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known some one, can we not -- "" ""Oh, it is useless to inquire,"" returned the count; ""perhaps, after all, he was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no secrets from me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me."" ""And he told you nothing?"" ""Not a word."" ""Nothing that would lead you to suppose?"" ""Nothing."" ""And yet you spoke of him at once."" ""Ah, in such a case one supposes"" -- ""Sister, sister,"" said Maximilian, coming to the count's aid, ""monsieur is quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us, `It was no Englishman that thus saved us.'"" Monte Cristo started. ""What did your father tell you, M. Morrel?"" said he eagerly. ""My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed -- he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh, it was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself believe it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father's faith. How often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend -- a friend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural light, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became a conviction, and his last words were, `Maximilian, it was Edmond Dantes!'"" At these words the count's paleness, which had for some time been increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his watch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words to Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and Maximilian, -- ""Madame,"" said he, ""I trust you will allow me to visit you occasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for your welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have thus yielded to my feelings;"" and he hastily quitted the apartment. ""This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,"" said Emmanuel. ""Yes,"" answered Maximilian, ""but I feel sure he has an excellent heart, and that he likes us."" ""His voice went to my heart,"" observed Julie; ""and two or three times I fancied that I had heard it before."" Pyramus and Thisbe. About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood, where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate, that dated from the time of Louis XII. This noble entrance, however, in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had fallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself, with its thickly planted court-yard, opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For the demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a street, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was laid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before construction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed street, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honore itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris. In matters of speculation, however, though ""man proposes,"" ""money disposes."" From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high price for it, and being quite unable to find any one willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a yearly rental of 500 francs. And so, as we have said, the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust, which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet. True, the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance. Horticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, pease, and melons had once flourished, a scanty crop of lucerne alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall, without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one corner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces off. Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the incessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks, -- the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter. At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared. He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair, beard and mustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded with his plebeian attire. After casting a rapid glance around him, in order to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small gate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier. At the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume, the young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty retreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and observed the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the planks, he exclaimed, ""Don't be alarmed, Valentine -- it is I!"" Again the timid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so, ""And why do you come so late to-day? It is almost dinner-time, and I had to use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my too-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me about coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to get done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that at first I did not recognize you."" ""Dearest Valentine,"" said the young man, ""the difference between our respective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love, but yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour forth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even thank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if you did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my being late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason of both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a trade."" ""A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such deep cause for uneasiness?"" ""Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than life itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about it. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously alarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here your father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. That would compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the fact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place where no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well create surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted the costume of my calling."" ""What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!"" ""Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life by such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger."" ""I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you really mean."" ""Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I stand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by the proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucerne. Think of that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you. Only imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain myself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price -- as a thing impossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all this delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have surrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per annum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my own ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the wall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the police as a suspicious character. I may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and unalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless, indeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the lips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap."" A faint cry of mingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine, who almost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though some envious cloud darkened the joy which illumined her heart, ""Alas, no, Maximilian, this must not be, for many reasons. We should presume too much on our own strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind confidence in each other's prudence."" ""How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear Valentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance, schooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you have, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger, I placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other reward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since, by word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you? You told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d'Epinay, and that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that from his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known to change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you wished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and order events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties, Valentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity on me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure anything."" ""Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my mother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be, as I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these meetings, so fraught with danger to both."" ""I will not admit that word,"" returned the young man; ""it is at once cruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to time, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere -- have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this enclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate -- to be close to you without really seeing you -- have I ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any knight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what I say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust."" ""It is true,"" said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender fingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian to press his lips to them, ""and you are a true and faithful friend; but still you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian, for you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend but yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father, harassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand can no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone, although there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as a victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only friend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I am very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity."" ""Valentine,"" replied the young man, deeply affected, ""I will not say you are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and brother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no manner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart beats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but I solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and intensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to return home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable and unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best; hope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me with selfishness, think a little what you have been to me -- the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have evinced? -- none whatever. What granted me? -- scarcely more. You tell me of M. Franz d'Epinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of being his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your heart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm drop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service; you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours -- that were I to lose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another! Oh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel conscious, as you do, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred times at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars, and said, `Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living or dead, I am yours -- yours only, and forever!'"" The poor girl made no reply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears. A rapid change took place in the young man's feelings. ""Dearest, dearest Valentine,"" exclaimed he, ""forgive me if I have offended you, and forget the words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain."" ""No, Maximilian, I am not offended,"" answered she, ""but do you not see what a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in my father's house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been thwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the iron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted, day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for, even observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the subject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am surrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The general remark is, `Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a character as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do on their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender age, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de Villefort.' The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from utter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile."" ""Hate you, sweet Valentine,"" exclaimed the young man; ""how is it possible for any one to do that?"" ""Alas,"" replied the weeping girl, ""I am obliged to own that my mother-in-law's aversion to me arises from a very natural source -- her overweening love for her own child, my brother Edward."" ""But why should it?"" ""I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into our present conversation, I will just say this much -- that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the fortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than doubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Meran, whose sole heiress I am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being so richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this wealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father's love. God knows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home."" ""Poor Valentine!"" ""I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the same time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the restraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too, my father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity; protected as he is by his high position and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him; he is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word. Dear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt to resist my father's commands it is more on your account than my own."" ""But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst, -- why picture so gloomy a future?"" ""Because I judge it from the past."" ""Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what is termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons, not altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in France, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and the memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our country, because you were born not far from Marseilles."" ""Don't speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word brings back my mother to my recollection -- my angel mother, who died too soon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her child during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I fondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were still living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would tell her that I loved you, and she would protect us."" ""I fear, Valentine,"" replied the lover, ""that were she living I should never have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me."" ""Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,"" cried Valentine; ""but there is one thing I wish to know."" ""And what is that?"" inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine hesitated. ""Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers dwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?"" ""Not that I am aware of,"" replied the young man, ""unless, indeed, any ill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties -- your father was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other difference between them. But why do you ask?"" ""I will tell you,"" replied the young girl, ""for it is but right you should know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the Legion of honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my grandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also -- you recollect M. Danglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with my mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed them? While the rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of Mademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but when I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else but read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all about it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at the idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that I really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I summoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I could."" ""Dear Valentine!"" ""Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of your name he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was so persuaded that every one must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start, and almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have been a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too."" ""`Morrel, Morrel,' cried my father, `stop a bit;' then knitting his brows into a deep frown, he added, `surely this cannot be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from their violent Bonapartism -- I mean about the year 1815.' -- `Yes,' replied M. Danglars, `I believe he is the son of the old shipowner.'"" ""Indeed,"" answered Maximilian; ""and what did your father say then, Valentine?"" ""Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don't dare to tell you."" ""Always tell me everything,"" said Maximilian with a smile. ""`Ah,' continued my father, still frowning, `their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved; he called them `food for powder,' which was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish the means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it certainly does cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized country.'"" ""Brutal politics, I must confess."" said Maximilian; ""but don't attach any serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was not a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. `Why,' said he, `does not the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and legal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could maintain, and using them to save better men?' You see, my dear, that for picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party. But what did M. Danglars say to this outburst on the part of the procureur?"" ""Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to himself -- half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up and took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation of my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only person capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I suspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence (for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man, without the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong impression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating manner."" ""The name of M. Noirtier,"" interposed Maximilian, ""is celebrated throughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may or may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every Bonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the Bourbons."" ""Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most strange -- the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have been the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics? But to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to question him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively at the newspaper I had been reading. `What is the matter, dear grandfather?' said I, `are you pleased?' He gave me a sign in the affirmative. `With what my father said just now?' He returned a sign in the negative. `Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?' Another sign in the negative. `Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn't dare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor?' He signified assent; only think of the poor old man's being so pleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been made an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim on his part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love him for showing so much interest in you."" ""How singular,"" murmured Maximilian; ""your father hates me, while your grandfather, on the contrary -- What strange feelings are aroused by politics."" ""Hush,"" cried Valentine, suddenly; ""some one is coming!"" Maximilian leaped at one bound into his crop of lucerne, which he began to pull up in the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it. ""Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!"" exclaimed a voice from behind the trees. ""Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the drawing-room."" ""A visitor?"" inquired Valentine, much agitated; ""who is it?"" ""Some grand personage -- a prince I believe they said -- the Count of Monte Cristo."" ""I will come directly,"" cried Valentine aloud. The name of Monte Cristo sent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the iron gate, to whom Valentine's ""I am coming"" was the customary signal of farewell. ""Now, then,"" said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his spade, ""I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the Count of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort."" Toxicology. It was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame de Villefort's for the purpose of returning the procureur's visit, and at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in confusion. Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when the count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither instantly to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this great personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to come to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of gratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance remark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent speeches which made his mother say, -- ""Oh, that naughty child! But I can't be severe with him, he is really so bright."" After the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort. ""My husband dines with the chancellor,"" replied the young lady; ""he has just gone, and I am sure he'll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the pleasure of seeing you before he went."" Two visitors who were there when the count arrived, having gazed at him with all their eyes, retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires. ""What is your sister Valentine doing?"" inquired Madame de Villefort of Edward; ""tell some one to bid her come here, that I may have the honor of introducing her to the count."" ""You have a daughter, then, madame?"" inquired the count; ""very young, I presume?"" ""The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,"" replied the young wife, ""a fine well-grown girl."" ""But melancholy,"" interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid parroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch, in order to make a plume for his hat. Madame de Villefort merely cried, -- ""Be still, Edward!"" She then added, -- ""This young madcap is, however, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is, in spite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty. But what detains her? Go, Edward, and see."" ""Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found."" ""And where are they looking for her?"" ""With grandpapa Noirtier."" ""And do you think she is not there?"" ""No, no, no, no, no, she is not there,"" replied Edward, singing his words. ""And where is she, then? If you know, why don't you tell?"" ""She is under the big chestnut-tree,"" replied the spoiled brat, as he gave, in spite of his mother's commands, live flies to the parrot, which seemed keenly to relish such fare. Madame de Villefort stretched out her hand to ring, intending to direct her waiting-maid to the spot where she would find Valentine, when the young lady herself entered the apartment. She appeared much dejected; and any person who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes. Valentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful girl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that reposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother. Her white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan. She entered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of whom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish awkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that redoubled the count's attention. He rose to return the salutation. ""Mademoiselle de Villefort, my daughter-in-law,"" said Madame de Villefort to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards Valentine with her hand. ""And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China, Emperor of Cochin-China,"" said the young imp, looking slyly towards his sister. Madame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly angry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward; but the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy complacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy and enthusiasm. ""But, madame,"" replied the count, continuing the conversation, and looking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, ""have I not already had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I could not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and as mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light thrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark."" ""I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very fond of society, and we very seldom go out,"" said the young lady. ""Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself, madame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world is entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in Paris but very few days. No, -- but, perhaps, you will permit me to call to mind -- stay!"" The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect his thoughts. ""No -- it was somewhere -- away from here -- it was -- I do not know -- but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fete; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her hand, the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden, and you, madame, were under the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my aid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?"" ""No, indeed,"" replied Madame de Villefort; ""and yet it appears to me, sir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory."" ""Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,"" said Valentine timidly. ""Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,"" replied Monte Cristo; ""you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?"" ""Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for my lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna, Perugia, and Rome."" ""Ah, yes -- true, mademoiselle,"" exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. ""It was at Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the Hotel des Postes, when chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and her son; I now remember having had the honor of meeting you."" ""I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hotel des Postes, and the festival of which you speak,"" said Madame de Villefort, ""but in vain do I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really do not recall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before."" ""It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,"" observed Valentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count. ""But I remember it perfectly,"" interposed the darling Edward. ""I will assist your memory, madame,"" continued the count; ""the day had been burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in consequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of the garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock."" ""And I caught it, mamma, don't you remember?"" interposed Edward, ""and I pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail."" ""You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while you were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you, Mademoiselle de Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed for a considerable time with somebody?"" ""Yes, in truth, yes,"" answered the young lady, turning very red, ""I do remember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he was a medical man, I think."" ""Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been at that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of a fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame, on different subjects; of Perugino, of Raffaelle, of manners, customs, of the famous aquatofana, of which they had told you, I think you said, that certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret."" ""Yes, true,"" replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, ""I remember now."" ""I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed, madame,"" continued the count with perfect calmness; ""but I perfectly remember that, falling into the error which others had entertained respecting me, you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de Villefort."" ""Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,"" said Madame de Villefort, ""since you had cured the sick."" ""Moliere or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was precisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself, I am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you understand."" -- At this moment the clock struck six. ""It is six o'clock,"" said Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated. ""Valentine, will you not go and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner?"" Valentine rose, and saluting the count, left the apartment without speaking. ""Oh, madame,"" said the count, when Valentine had left the room, ""was it on my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?"" ""By no means,"" replied the young lady quickly; ""but this is the hour when we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my husband's father?"" ""Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me -- a paralysis, I think."" ""Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone is still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering, like the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me, sir, for talking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist."" ""No, madame, I did not say as much as that,"" replied the count with a smile; ""quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having determined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following the example of King Mithridates."" ""Mithridates rex Ponticus,"" said the young scamp, as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album, ""the individual who took cream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast."" ""Edward, you naughty boy,"" exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching the mutilated book from the urchin's grasp, ""you are positively past bearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join your sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier's room."" ""The album,"" said Edward sulkily. ""What do you mean? -- the album!"" ""I want the album."" ""How dare you tear out the drawings?"" ""Oh, it amuses me."" ""Go -- go at once."" ""I won't go unless you give me the album,"" said the boy, seating himself doggedly in an arm-chair, according to his habit of never giving way. ""Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,"" said Madame de Villefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door, led by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes. ""Let us see if she shuts the door after him,"" he muttered. Madame de Villefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count appearing not to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the chamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated herself. ""Allow me to observe, madame,"" said the count, with that kind tone he could assume so well, ""you are really very severe with that dear clever child."" ""Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,"" replied Madame de Villefort, with all a mother's real firmness. ""It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he referred to King Mithridates,"" continued the count, ""and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected him, for your son is really advanced for his years."" ""The fact is, count,"" answered the mother, agreeably flattered, ""he has great aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one fault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment to what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these precautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?"" ""I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I might not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna -- that is to say, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must have lost my life."" ""And your precautions were successful?"" ""Completely so."" ""Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this sort."" ""Indeed?"" said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well counterfeited; ""I really did not remember."" ""I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect, on men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South."" ""And that is the case,"" observed Monte Cristo. ""I have seen Russians devour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab."" ""And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of poison?"" ""Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not been accustomed."" ""Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for instance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?"" ""Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would be made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance, brucine"" -- ""Brucine is extracted from the false angostura* is it not?"" inquired Madame de Villefort. ""Precisely, madame,"" replied Monte Cristo; ""but I perceive I have not much to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such learning is very rare among ladies."" * Brucoea ferruginea. ""Oh, I am aware of that,"" said Madame de Villefort; ""but I have a passion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like poetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but go on, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree."" ""Well,"" replied Monte Cristo ""suppose, then, that this poison was brucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two milligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days you would have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days, increasing another milligramme, you would have taken three hundred centigrammes; that is to say, a dose which you would support without inconvenience, and which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken the same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the end of a month, when drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person who drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight inconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this water."" ""Do you know any other counter-poisons?"" ""I do not."" ""I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,"" said Madame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, ""and had always considered it a fable."" ""No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell me, madame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query, for two years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for a very long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind."" ""True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and mineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples frequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life of individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love affair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a Flamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis."" ""And the more, madame,"" said Monte Cristo, ""as the Orientals do not confine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his poisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their hands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an offensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings, the other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucaea, snake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in their way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or Greek, whom here you call `good women,' who do not know how, by means of chemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor."" ""Really,"" said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange fire at this conversation. ""Oh, yes, indeed, madame,"" continued Monte Cristo, ""the secret dramas of the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion -- begin with paradise and end with -- hell. There are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral nature of humanity; and I will say further -- the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance."" ""But, sir,"" remarked the young woman, ""these Eastern societies, in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can easily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and Bassora of the `Thousand and One Nights.' The sultans and viziers who rule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the government, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only pardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has been an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole story written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and ennui."" ""By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There, disguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are police agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They hang, behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible manner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape human justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose of, goes straight to the grocer's or druggist's, gives a false name, which leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or six grammes of arsenic -- if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only five or six times more easily traced; -- then, when he has acquired his specific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without rhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables. They fetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a hundred newspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and the murderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists, come and say, `It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;' and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize twenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated, confronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if she be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for life. This is the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry, madame. Desrues was, however, I must confess, more skilful."" ""What would you have, sir?"" said the lady, laughing; ""we do what we can. All the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias."" ""Now,"" replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, ""shall I tell you the cause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by what at least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see persons swallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring, and fall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and the spectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder; they see neither the police commissary with his badge of office, nor the corporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the whole thing is as easy as lying. But go a little way from France -- go either to Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome, and you will see people passing by you in the streets -- people erect, smiling, and fresh-colored, of whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle, would say, `That man was poisoned three weeks ago; he will be a dead man in a month.'"" ""Then,"" remarked Madame de Villefort, ""they have again discovered the secret of the famous aquatofana that they said was lost at Perugia."" ""Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about and make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the vulgar do not follow them -- that is all; but there is always the same result. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another -- one on the stomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the poison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or some other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however, by no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were not, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by foolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in favor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of whom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance, the worthy Abbe Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly."" ""It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,"" said the young lady, motionless with attention. ""I thought, I must confess, that these tales, were inventions of the Middle Ages."" ""Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time, rewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and that is half the battle."" ""So,"" added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object, ""the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renes, the Ruggieris, and later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so misused by modern drama and romance"" -- ""Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more,"" replied the count. ""Do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds, trials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them. Thus, for instance, the excellent Abbe Adelmonte, of whom I spoke just now, made in this way some marvellous experiments."" ""Really?"" ""Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple -- a cabbage, for instance. For three days he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the cabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the eyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome appearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbe Adelmonte. He then took the cabbage to the room where he had rabbits -- for the Abbe Adelmonte had a collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his collection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abbe Adelmonte took a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died. What magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything against this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs they have killed? -- not one. So, then, the rabbit dies, and justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abbe Adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this dunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken ill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the convulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many vultures in Adelmonte's country); this bird darts on the dead fowl, and carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days afterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since that dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat greedily always, as everybody knows -- well, they feast on the vulture. Now suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned at the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest will be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight or ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the pylorus. The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound learning, `The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid fever!'"" ""But,"" remarked Madame de Villefort, ""all these circumstances which you link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the vulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the fish-pond."" ""Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the East, one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved."" -- Madame de Villefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively. ""But,"" she exclaimed, suddenly, ""arsenic is indelible, indestructible; in whatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of the victim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause death."" ""Precisely so,"" cried Monte Cristo -- ""precisely so; and this is what I said to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by a Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, `My son, the world was not made in a day -- but in seven. Return on Sunday.' On the Sunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of salts, having their basis in strychnine, strychnos colubrina, as the learned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of disease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust; yet, five minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at the rabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the vultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had disappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar indication in any organ -- an excitement of the nervous system -- that was it; a case of cerebral congestion -- nothing more. The fowl had not been poisoned -- she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls, I believe, but very common among men."" Madame de Villefort appeared more and more thoughtful. ""It is very fortunate,"" she observed, ""that such substances could only be prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning each other."" ""By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,"" said Monte Cristo carelessly. ""And then,"" said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and with effort, to get away from her thoughts, ""however skilfully it is prepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it does not escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are in cases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell -- that is the point."" ""Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure mind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning. The bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of Jean Jacques Rousseau, -- you remember, -- the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man's whole life passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and brutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will administer to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule -- eccentric or stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to thirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the feelings excited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is permissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym, then, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an `elimination;' you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence, without the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a punishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense of the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no groans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid and compromising moment of accomplishing the act, -- then one escapes the clutch of the human law, which says, `Do not disturb society!' This is the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern climes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very little for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance."" ""Yet conscience remains,"" remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated voice, and with a stifled sigh. ""Yes,"" answered Monte Cristo ""happily, yes, conscience does remain; and if it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring exertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons, howsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little before a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard III., for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say, `These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited the vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities -- these two children are impediments in my way of promoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they (the children) would infallibly have caused.' Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her husband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is a great virtue, a powerful motive -- so powerful that it excuses a multitude of things, even if, after Duncan's death, Lady Macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience."" Madame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him. After a moment's silence, the lady inquired, ""Do you know, my dear count,"" she said, ""that you are a very terrible reasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered medium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through alembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the elixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost instantaneously"" -- ""Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; one drop of that elixir sufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would have impelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced most violent palpitations; six would have suspended his respiration, and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was; ten would have destroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched?"" ""Is it then so terrible a poison?"" ""Oh, no. In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does not exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons, which become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies."" ""What, then, is it?"" ""A skilful preparation of my friend's the worthy Abbe Adelmonte, who taught me the use of it."" ""Oh,"" observed Madame de Villefort, ""it must be an admirable anti-spasmodic."" ""Perfect, madame, as you have seen,"" replied the count; ""and I frequently make use of it -- with all possible prudence though, be it observed,"" he added with a smile of intelligence. ""Most assuredly,"" responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. ""As for me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require a Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and tranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of suffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in France, and your abbe is not probably disposed to make a journey to Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche's anti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman's drops are among my favorite remedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they are compounded doubly strong."" Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell box, which the lady presented to him, and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition. ""They are indeed exquisite,"" he said; ""but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition -- a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish -- I prefer my own specific."" ""Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen produced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you."" ""But I,"" said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke -- ""I am gallant enough to offer it you."" ""How kind you are."" ""Only remember one thing -- a small dose is a remedy, a large one is poison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will inevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into a glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor. But I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were prescribing for you."" The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend of Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her. ""If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time, count, instead of only for the second,"" said Madame de Villefort; ""if I had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the happiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on detaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal."" ""A thousand thanks, madame,"" replied Monte Cristo ""but I have an engagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the Academie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither."" ""Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription."" ""Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour's conversation I have had with you, which is indeed impossible."" Monte Cristo bowed, and left the house. Madame de Villefort remained immersed in thought. ""He is a very strange man,"" she said, ""and in my opinion is himself the Adelmonte he talks about."" As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed his utmost expectations. ""Good,"" said he, as he went away; ""this is a fruitful soil, and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast on barren ground."" Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the prescription requested. Robert le Diable. The pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as there chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction at the Academie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe illness, made his reappearance in the character of Bertrand, and, as usual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience. Morcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his orchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least a dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance; he had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box. Chateau-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a journalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened that on this particular night the minister's box was placed at the disposal of Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again, upon his mother's rejection of it, sent it to Danglars, with an intimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the baroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their accepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too much pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the presentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a king's ransom in his waistcoat pocket. Danglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a ministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his parliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched a note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with Eugenie to the opera. There is no gainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort, while the addition of a third, in the person of her mother's admitted lover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature. One must take the world as one finds it. The curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of the absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is generally played without the slightest attention being paid to it, that part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of opening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation. ""Surely,"" said Albert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, ""that must be the Countess G----."" ""And who is the Countess G---- ?"" inquired Chateau-Renaud. ""What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick a quarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the Countess G---- was."" ""Ah, to be sure,"" replied Chateau-Renaud; ""the lovely Venetian, is it not?"" ""Herself."" At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and returned his salutation with a smile. ""You know her, it seems?"" said Chateau-Renaud. ""Franz introduced me to her at Rome,"" replied Albert. ""Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in Rome?"" ""With pleasure."" There was a cry of ""Shut up!"" from the audience. This manifestation on the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the music, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who continued their conversation. ""The countess was present at the races in the Champ-de-Mars,"" said Chateau-Renaud. ""To-day?"" ""Yes."" ""Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?"" ""Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis."" ""And who was the winner?"" ""Nautilus. I staked on him."" ""But there were three races, were there not?"" ""Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club -- a gold cup, you know -- and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race."" ""What was it?"" ""Oh, shut up!"" again interposed some of the audience. ""Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course."" ""Is that possible?"" ""True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the name of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last moment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist, presented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider's pockets, to make him weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against whom he ran, by at least three whole lengths."" ""And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey belonged?"" ""No."" ""You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?"" ""Exactly; that was the title."" ""Then,"" answered Albert, ""I am better informed than you are, and know who the owner of that horse was."" ""Shut up, there!"" cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and manner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility that the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate was addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them, as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge, the friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected to busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the minister's box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter, entered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to their seats. ""Ha, ha,"" said Chateau-Renaud, ""here comes some friends of yours, viscount! What are you looking at there? don't you see they are trying to catch your eye?"" Albert turned round, just in time to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugenie, she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes even upon the business of the stage. ""I tell you what, my dear fellow,"" said Chateau-Renaud, ""I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to Mademoiselle Danglars -- that is, setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way I don't think you care very much about. Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a deuced fine girl!"" ""Handsome, certainly,"" replied Albert, ""but not to my taste, which I confess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine."" ""Ah, well,"" exclaimed Chateau-Renaud, who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of paternal air with his more youthful friend, ""you young people are never satisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not content."" ""No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked something more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this chase-loving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort of alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actaeon."" And, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to comprehend the justness of Morcerf's remark -- she was beautiful, but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by well-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost habitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex -- her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found fault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the almost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark mole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally are, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended to increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her countenance. The rest of Mademoiselle Eugenie's person was in perfect keeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of Diana, as Chateau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and resolute. As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote poetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance, assisted by a schoolfellow, -- a young woman without fortune whose talent promised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the principal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence. But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle Danglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one destined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the banker's daughter, though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with her through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company. Still, though not actually received at the Hotel Danglars in the light of an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess. The curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame Danglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed half-hour's interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were left at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive visits in their respective boxes. Morcerf and Chateau-Renaud were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission. For an instant the idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she whispered her expectations to her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to pay his respects to them. Mademoiselle Eugenie, however, merely returned a dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she directed the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first circle, in which sat the Countess G---- , and where Morcerf had just made his appearance. ""So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?"" cried the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance; ""it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on me."" ""Be assured,"" replied Albert, ""that if I had been aware of your arrival in Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects to you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de Chateau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France, and from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday."" Chateau-Renaud bowed to the countess. ""So you were at the races, baron?"" inquired the countess eagerly. ""Yes, madame."" ""Well, then,"" pursued Madame G---- with considerable animation, ""you can probably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?"" ""I am sorry to say I cannot,"" replied the baron; ""and I was just asking the same question of Albert."" ""Are you very anxious to know, countess?"" asked Albert. ""To know what?"" ""The name of the owner of the winning horse?"" ""Excessively; only imagine -- but do tell me, viscount, whether you really are acquainted with it or no?"" ""I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story, were you not? You said, `only imagine,' -- and then paused. Pray continue."" ""Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid roan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were at stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the winning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with joy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object I met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I concluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse must live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments, I beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and rider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written these words -- `From Lord Ruthven to Countess G---- .'"" ""Precisely; I was sure of it,"" said Morcerf. ""Sure of what?"" ""That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself."" ""What Lord Ruthven do you mean?"" ""Why, our Lord Ruthven -- the Vampire of the Salle Argentino!"" ""Is it possible?"" exclaimed the countess; ""is he here in Paris?"" ""To be sure, -- why not?"" ""And you visit him? -- meet him at your own house and elsewhere?"" ""I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Chateau-Renaud has also the honor of his acquaintance."" ""But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club prize?"" ""Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?"" ""What of that?"" ""Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I was made prisoner?"" ""Oh, yes."" ""And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?"" ""To be sure, I remember it all now."" ""He called himself Vampa. You see, it's evident where the count got the name."" ""But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?"" ""In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may believe; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an interest in his success."" ""I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish remarks we used to make about him?"" ""I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his presenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven"" -- ""Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge."" ""Does his action appear like that of an enemy?"" ""No; certainly not."" ""Well, then"" -- ""And so he is in Paris?"" ""Yes."" ""And what effect does he produce?"" ""Why,"" said Albert, ""he was talked about for a week; then the coronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of Mademoiselle Mars's diamonds; and so people talked of something else."" ""My good fellow,"" said Chateau-Renaud, ""the count is your friend and you treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you, countess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by the appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth 32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous preservation of Madame de Villefort's life; now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain, in spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest at this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a month longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which, after all, may be his ordinary mode of existence."" ""Perhaps you are right,"" said Morcerf; ""meanwhile, who is in the Russian ambassador's box?"" ""Which box do you mean?"" asked the countess. ""The one between the pillars on the first tier -- it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh."" ""Did you observe any one during the first act?"" asked Chateau-Renaud. ""Where?"" ""In that box."" ""No,"" replied the countess, ""it was certainly empty during the first act;"" then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she said, ""And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte Cristo that gained the prize?"" ""I am sure of it."" ""And who afterwards sent the cup to me?"" ""Undoubtedly."" ""But I don't know him,"" said the countess; ""I have a great mind to return it."" ""Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed of a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is his way, and you must take him as you find him."" At this moment the bell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act. Albert rose to return to his place. ""Shall I see you again?"" asked the countess. ""At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come and inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?"" ""Pray take notice,"" said the countess, ""that my present residence is 22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday evening. So now, you are both forewarned."" The young men bowed, and quitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls, they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador. A man of from thirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just entered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style. The lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all eyes upon her. ""Hullo,"" said Albert; ""it is Monte Cristo and his Greek!"" The strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haidee. In a few moments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house, and even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent diamonds. The second act passed away during one continued buzz of voices -- one deep whisper -- intimating that some great and universally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were occupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. Upon this occasion an unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see Albert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and neither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the close of the act he therefore went to the baroness. Having bowed to the two ladies, he extended his hand to Debray. By the baroness he was most graciously welcomed, while Eugenie received him with her accustomed coldness. ""My dear fellow,"" said Debray, ""you have come in the nick of time. There is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she insists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage, where he came from, and whither he is going. Being no disciple of Cagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out of the scrape, I said, `Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of his beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers' ends;' whereupon the baroness signified her desire to see you."" ""Is it not almost incredible,"" said Madame Danglars, ""that a person having at least half a million of secret-service money at his command, should possess so little information?"" ""Let me assure you, madame,"" said Lucien, ""that had I really the sum you mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte Cristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I care nothing about the count or his mysterious doings."" ""I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth 32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000 francs each."" ""He seems to have a mania for diamonds,"" said Morcerf, smiling, ""and I verily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for the sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint stones."" ""Perhaps he has discovered some mine,"" said Madame Danglars. ""I suppose you know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron's banking establishment?"" ""I was not aware of it,"" replied Albert, ""but I can readily believe it."" ""And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only staying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six millions. ""He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling incog."" ""Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?"" inquired Eugenie. ""I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms of another as yourself,"" responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his eye. ""A most lovely creature, upon my soul!"" was his verdict.  Back to Full Books byAlexandre Dumas [Pere] ""Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?"" inquired Eugenie; ""does anybody know?"" ""Mademoiselle,"" said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, ""I can give you very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points relative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing -- the young woman is a Greek."" ""So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, every one here is as well-informed as yourself."" ""I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone,"" replied Morcerf, ""but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing further to communicate -- yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely, that she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting with the count, I heard the sound of a guzla -- it is impossible that it could have been touched by any other finger than her own."" ""Then your count entertains visitors, does he?"" asked Madame Danglars. ""Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you."" ""I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner, or something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return."" ""What,"" said Debray, laughing; ""do you really mean you would go to his house?"" ""Why not? my husband could accompany me."" ""But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?"" ""You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,"" said the baroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek. ""No, no!"" exclaimed Debray; ""that girl is not his wife: he told us himself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us so at your breakfast?"" ""Well, then,"" said the baroness, ""if slave she be, she has all the air and manner of a princess."" ""Of the `Arabian Nights'?"" ""If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes a princess. Why, diamonds -- and she is covered with them."" ""To me she seems overloaded,"" observed Eugenie; ""she would look far better if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists."" ""See how the artist peeps out!"" exclaimed Madame Danglars. ""My poor Eugenie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts."" ""I admire all that is beautiful,"" returned the young lady. ""What do you think of the count?"" inquired Debray; ""he is not much amiss, according to my ideas of good looks."" ""The count,"" repeated Eugenie, as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner; ""the count? -- oh, he is so dreadfully pale."" ""I quite agree with you,"" said Morcerf; ""and the secret of that very pallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G---- insists upon it that he is a vampire."" ""Then the Countess G---- has returned to Paris, has she?"" inquired the baroness. ""Is that she, mamma?"" asked Eugenie; ""almost opposite to us, with that profusion of beautiful light hair?"" ""Yes,"" said Madame Danglars, ""that is she. Shall I tell you what you ought to do, Morcerf?"" ""Command me, madame."" ""Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us."" ""What for?"" asked Eugenie. ""What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no desire to meet him?"" ""None whatever,"" replied Eugenie. ""Strange child,"" murmured the baroness. ""He will very probably come of his own accord,"" said Morcerf. ""There; do you see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows."" The baroness returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful manner. ""Well,"" said Morcerf, ""I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself away to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any means of speaking to him."" ""Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan."" ""But I have never been presented."" ""Presented to whom?"" ""To the beautiful Greek."" ""You say she is only a slave?"" ""While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I hope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out."" ""That is possible -- go."" ""I am going,"" said Albert, as he made his parting bow. Just as he was passing the count's box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo came forth. After giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby, the count took Albert's arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali placed himself before it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian. ""Upon my word,"" said Monte Cristo, ""Paris is a strange city, and the Parisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected around poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one might suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can promise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in Tunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that way."" ""That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as far as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is merely from the circumstance of his being your attendant -- you, who are at this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris."" ""Really? and what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?"" ""What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand louis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the name of Major Brack you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first handsome woman you think of!"" ""And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?"" ""Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the by, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others; secondly, I learned it from Beauchamp's journal; and thirdly, from my own imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse Vampa?"" ""That was an oversight, certainly,"" replied the count; ""but tell me, does the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking for him, but without success."" ""He will be here to-night."" ""In what part of the house?"" ""In the baroness's box, I believe."" ""That charming young woman with her is her daughter?"" ""Yes."" ""I congratulate you."" Morcerf smiled. ""We will discuss that subject at length some future time,"" said he. ""But what do you think of the music?"" ""What music?"" ""Why, the music you have been listening to."" ""Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by featherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes."" ""From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?"" ""You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go to sleep."" ""Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what else was opera invented for?"" ""No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner I speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain preparation"" -- ""I know -- the famous hashish!"" ""Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with music come and sup with me."" ""I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,"" said Morcerf. ""Do you mean at Rome?"" ""I do."" ""Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haidee's guzla; the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native land."" Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell into a silent reverie. The bell rang at this moment for the rising of the curtain. ""You will excuse my leaving you,"" said the count, turning in the direction of his box. ""What? Are you going?"" ""Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G---- on the part of her friend the Vampire."" ""And what message shall I convey to the baroness!"" ""That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my respects in the course of the evening."" The third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf, according to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame Danglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either interest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence, therefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in which he had just seated himself. The quick eye of Monte Cristo however, marked his coming; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his lips. Haidee, whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage, like all unsophisticated natures, delighted in whatever addressed itself to the eye or ear. The third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julie, and Leroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the Prince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking his daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides, the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle. After which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon. The count left his box, and a moment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars, who could not restrain a cry of mingled pleasure and surprise. ""You are welcome, count!"" she exclaimed, as he entered. ""I have been most anxious to see you, that I might repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express."" ""Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your remembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it."" ""But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day after your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame de Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me."" ""This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my Nubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort."" ""Was it Ali,"" asked the Count of Morcerf, ""who rescued my son from the hands of bandits?"" ""No, count,"" replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the general; ""in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks; but you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt -- if indeed there existed one -- and I feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with an introduction to your daughter?"" ""Oh, you are no stranger -- at least not by name,"" replied Madame Danglars, ""and the last two or three days we have really talked of nothing but you. Eugenie,"" continued the baroness, turning towards her daughter, ""this is the Count of Monte Cristo."" The Count bowed, while Mademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly. ""You have a charming young person with you to-night, count,"" said Eugenie. ""Is she your daughter?"" ""No, mademoiselle,"" said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and freedom of the question. ""She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my care."" ""And what is her name?"" ""Haidee,"" replied Monte Cristo. ""A Greek?"" murmured the Count of Morcerf. ""Yes, indeed, count,"" said Madame Danglars; ""and tell me, did you ever see at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly served, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?"" ""Did I hear rightly, monsieur,"" said Monte Cristo ""that you served at Yanina?"" ""I was inspector-general of the pasha's troops,"" replied Morcerf; ""and it is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality of the illustrious Albanese chief."" ""But look!"" exclaimed Madame Danglars. ""Where?"" stammered Morcerf. ""There,"" said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and leaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haidee, whose eyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian, perceived his pale features close to Morcerf's face. It was as if the young girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint cry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people about Ali, who instantly opened the box-door. ""Why, count,"" exclaimed Eugenie, ""what has happened to your ward? she seems to have been taken suddenly ill."" ""Very probably,"" answered the count. ""But do not be alarmed on her account. Haidee's nervous system is delicately organized, and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers -- nay, there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,"" continued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, ""I have an infallible remedy."" So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her daughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the count, and left Madame Danglars' box. Upon his return to Haidee he found her still very pale. As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own hands were moist and icy cold. ""Who was it you were talking with over there?"" she asked. ""With the Count of Morcerf,"" answered Monte Cristo. ""He tells me he served your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him."" ""Wretch!"" exclaimed Haidee, her eyes flashing with rage; ""he sold my father to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his treachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?"" ""Something of this I heard in Epirus,"" said Monte Cristo; ""but the particulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my child. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting."" ""Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful man."" So saying, Haidee arose, and wrapping herself in her burnoose of white cashmire embroidered with pearls and coral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act. ""Do you observe,"" said the Countess G---- to Albert, who had returned to her side, ""that man does nothing like other people; he listens most devoutly to the third act of `Robert le Diable,' and when the fourth begins, takes his departure.""  "
Pride and Prejudice: Novel Summary: Chapters 37-40," Darcy and Fitzwilliam leave Rosings the next morning, and Lady Catherine invites the parish party over to dine with her.  Lady Catherine tries to talk Elizabeth into staying another month, but Elizabeth is determined to soon return home as planned. During the last week of Elizabeth and Maria's visit, they frequently are invited to Lady Catherine's, where she gives much advice on how they should travel and who should accompany them and how they should pack.   On Saturday before she leaves, Elizabeth is alone with Collins for a while, giving him the opportunity to thank her for coming, to say again how lucky they are that Lady Catherine invites them over so often, and to stress how happy he and Charlotte are.  Maria and Elizabeth leave on the chaise, and in four hours are at Mr. Gardiner's house, where they will spend a few days before they and Jane return to Longbourn.  Elizabeth finds Jane doing well, and cannot wait to tell her of Darcy's proposal, although she is not sure how much she should tell her of what Darcy said of Bingley.  It is the second week in May when Elizabeth, Jane and Maria meet up with Catherine and Lydia on the way to Longbourn.  Lydia tells them that the regiment will soon be leaving Meryton, and will be stationed near Brighton.  Lydia tells the sisters that she is trying to talk their father into taking them there over the summer.  Lydia also talks much about Wickham, saying that the woman that he had been courting had gone to Liverpool, so there is no danger of Wickham marrying her after all.  They all return home to a kind reception.  Elizabeth can no longer wait to tell Jane of what had happened with Darcy, so she concludes to suppress any part of the story that concerns her.  Jane is all astonishment, and feels sorry for the sadness that Elizabeth's refusal must have given Darcy.  Elizabeth then relates the parts of the letter that refer to Wickham, and Jane is shocked that Wickham could have been so very bad.  The two discuss whether they should tell anyone else of Wickham's behavior, but decided against it since his regiment is leaving Meryton soon anyway.  Elizabeth feels that she should not relate any of the news of Bingley and how he did indeed care for her, although she notices that Jane is not happy and still has a tender affection for Bingley. ",Pride and Prejudice,Chapters 37-40,"  The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her. Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. ""What would she have said? how would she have behaved?"" were questions with which she amused herself. Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. ""I assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"" said Lady Catherine; ""I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases."" Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter. Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added: ""But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."" ""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" replied Elizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."" ""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."" ""But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."" ""Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another MONTH complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."" ""You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."" Lady Catherine seemed resigned. ""Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to YOU to let them go alone."" ""My uncle is to send a servant for us."" ""Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."" Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections. Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever. Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family! When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful. Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh. When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.  On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary. ""I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"" said he, ""whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it. The favor of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."" Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make HER feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied: ""It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."" Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences. ""You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."" Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings. ""But,"" he added, ""you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."" Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off. ""Good gracious!"" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, ""it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!"" ""A great many indeed,"" said her companion with a sigh. ""We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"" Elizabeth added privately, ""And how much I shall have to conceal!"" Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days. Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.  It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber. After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, ""Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"" ""And we mean to treat you all,"" added Lydia, ""but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."" Then, showing her purchases--""Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."" And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, ""Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."" ""Are they indeed!"" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. ""They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"" ""Yes,"" thought Elizabeth, ""THAT would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"" ""Now I have got some news for you,"" said Lydia, as they sat down at table. ""What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about a certain person we all like!"" Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: ""Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."" ""And Mary King is safe!"" added Elizabeth; ""safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."" ""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."" ""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"" said Jane. ""I am sure there is not on HIS. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"" Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of EXPRESSION herself, the coarseness of the SENTIMENT was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal! As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it. ""How nicely we are all crammed in,"" cried Lydia. ""I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are SUCH friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And THAT Back to Full Books byJane Austen made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."" With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name. Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: ""I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."" Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her. ""Oh! Mary,"" said she, ""I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"" To this Mary very gravely replied, ""Far be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for ME--I should infinitely prefer a book."" But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all. In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to HER of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.  "
Henry VIII: Novel Summary: Act 3 Scene 1,"    Katherine is sewing with her ladies-in-waiting. She asks one of them to sing. The woman sings a song about the power of music to heal sorrow. A Gentleman enters and tells Katherine that the cardinals want to speak with her. As Katherine asks him to show them in, she worries about what they want with her. Wolsey and Campeius enter. Wolsey asks her if they can speak in a private room, but she says that her conscience is clear, so she is happy to speak here. Wolsey begins to speak to her in Latin, but she stops him, saying that it could make people think that there is something about her cause which must be hidden. She asks him to speak in English, for all to hear. Wolsey says that they have come not to accuse her, but to know her intentions in the matter of the divorce, and to give her advice and comfort. Campeius says that Wolsey, out of nobility of spirit, has forgiven Katherine for her false accusations against him, and has come to offer help. Katherine is not convinced, saying in an aside to the audience that they have come to betray her. She tells the cardinals that she needs more time to seek counsel before she can give an answer on such an important matter. She tells them she is ""a woman friendless, hopeless"" (line 80). Wolsey insists that she has both friends and hopes, but she points out that no Englishman would dare to help her, as to do so would be to oppose the king. Those friends she has, she says, are in Spain. Campeius and Wolsey advise her to place herself under the king's protection, since if the court's judgment goes against her, she risks being disgraced. Katherine tells them that they both wish her ruin, but that there is a higher judge that no king can corrupt - God. She says that she thought them holy men, but now sees that they are heartless and full of sin. She feels that they are enjoying seeing her misery, but warns them to be careful, lest her misfortune rebounds on them. She asks them why she should place her cause in the hands of the king, who hates her. He has banished her from his bed, and she lost his love long ago. She is old, she says, and her relationship with the king consists merely of her obedience. She has been a loving and constant wife, yet she is rewarded by being rejected. Nothing but death will separate her from her ""dignities"" - her royal title of queen and, presumably, her marriage to the king. Katherine wishes that she had never come to England. She worries about what will become of her and her ladies. Wolsey protests that he and Campeius mean well, and that she is wrong in her suspicions about them. He warns her that she may damage her cause with the king by her stubborn attitude. Campeius insists that the king loves her and that they only wish to do her service. Katherine tells them to do as they will, and sarcastically says that if she has misunderstood their intentions, it is because she is only a woman, lacking understanding. She says she still loves the king and prays for him. Analysis Katherine, unlike Buckingham, is not prepared to go quietly to her fate. She puts up a strong fight, accusing the cardinals of plotting to betray her and enjoying seeing her suffer. In fact, we do not know the real motives of the cardinals on this occasion or whether they are genuinely trying to help her, as they claim. Several times, Katherine contrasts the holy exteriors of the cardinals with their corrupt inner nature. At lines 103-4, she puns on the clergy title of ""cardinal,"" which Wolsey and Campeius both have, and the ""cardinal (meaning principal or chief) virtues"" and ""cardinal sins,"" as defined by the church. There are seven cardinal virtues: faith, hope, love, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance; and seven cardinal sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, gluttony and lust. While Wolsey and Campeius appear to be ""two reverend cardinal virtues,"" she fears that instead they are ""cardinal sins and hollow hearts."" Then, at line 117, she questions whether the two cardinals are ""anything but churchmen's habits"" - that is, whether they have only the external appearance of holiness and not the inner quality. At line 145, once again taking up this theme of external appearance and inner reality, she says, ""Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts."" Katherine's fate is particularly harsh in the light of her having done nothing wrong. She has been a faultless wife and still loves Henry. He is getting rid of her because she has failed to give him a male heir, because he desires Anne, and because Wolsey is engineering the divorce. From the point of view of the play's grand purpose, however, Katherine's 'fault' is that she is not the mother of Elizabeth. Therefore she must make way for Anne. ",Henry VIII,Act 3 Scene 1," SCENE I. London. The Queen's apartments. [The Queen and her women, as at work.] QUEEN KATHERINE. Take thy lute, wench; my soul grows sad with troubles. Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst. Leave working.   SONG Orpheus with his lute made trees And the mountain tops that freeze  Bow themselves when he did sing. To his music plants and flowers Ever sprung; as sun and showers  There had made a lasting spring. Every thing that heard him play, Even the billows of the sea,  Hung their heads, and then lay by. In sweet music is such art, Killing care and grief of heart  Fall asleep, or hearing, die. [Enter a Gentleman.] QUEEN KATHERINE. How now! GENTLEMAN. An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals Wait in the presence. QUEEN KATHERINE. Would they speak with me? GENTLEMAN. They will'd me say so, madam. QUEEN KATHERINE. Pray their Graces To come near. [Exit Gentleman.] What can be their business With me, a poor weak woman, fallen from favour? I do not like their coming. Now I think on't, They should be good men, their affairs as righteous. But all hoods make not monks. [Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius.] WOLSEY. Peace to your Highness! QUEEN KATHERINE. Your Graces find me here part of housewife; I would be all, against the worst may happen. What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords? WOLSEY. May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw Into your private chamber, we shall give you The full cause of our coming. QUEEN KATHERINE. Speak it here; There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience, Deserves a corner. Would all other women Could speak this with as free a soul as I do! My lords, I care not, so much I am happy Above a number, if my actions Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em, Envy and base opinion set against 'em, I know my life so even. If your business Seek me out, and that way I am wife in, Out with it boldly. Truth loves open dealing. WOLSEY. Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima,-- QUEEN KATHERINE. O, good my lord, no Latin; I am not such a truant since my coming, As not to know the language I have liv'd in. A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious; Pray, speak in English. Here are some will thank you, If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake. Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal, The willing'st sin I ever yet committed May be absolv'd in English. WOLSEY. Noble lady, I am sorry my integrity should breed, And service to his Majesty and you, So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant. We come not by the way of accusation To taint that honour every good tongue blesses, Nor to betray you any way to sorrow; You have too much, good lady; but to know How you stand minded in the weighty difference Between the King and you; and to deliver, Like free and honest men, our just opinions And comforts to your cause. CAMPEIUS. Most honour'd madam, My Lord of York, out of his noble nature, Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace, Forgetting, like a good man, your late censure Both of his truth and him, which was too far, Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace, His service and his counsel. QUEEN KATHERINE. [Aside.] To betray me.-- My lords, I thank you both for your good wills. Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so! But how to make ye suddenly an answer, In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,-- More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit, And to such men of gravity and learning, In truth I know not. I was set at work Among my maids; full little, God knows, looking Either for such men or such business. For her sake that I have been,--for I feel The last fit of my greatness--good your Graces, Let me have time and counsel for my cause. Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless! WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears. Your hopes and friends are infinite. QUEEN KATHERINE. In England But little for my profit. Can you think, lords, That any Englishman dare give me counsel? Or be a known friend, 'gainst his Highness' pleasure, Though he be grown so desperate to be honest, And live a subject? Nay, forsooth; my friends, They that much weigh out my afflictions, They that my trust must grow to, live not here; They are, as all my other comforts, far hence In mine own country, lords. CAMPEIUS. I would your Grace Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel. QUEEN KATHERINE. How, sir? CAMPEIUS. Put your main cause into the King's protection; He's loving and most gracious. 'Twill be much Both for your honour better and your cause; For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye, You'll part away disgrac'd. WOLSEY. He tells you rightly. QUEEN KATHERINE. Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin. Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye! Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge That no king can corrupt. CAMPEIUS. Your rage mistakes us. QUEEN KATHERINE. The more shame for ye! Holy men I thought ye, Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues; But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye. Mend 'em, for shame, my lords! Is this your comfort, The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady, A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd? I will not wish ye half my miseries; I have more charity; but say, I warn'd ye. Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye. WOLSEY. Madam, this is a mere distraction; You turn the good we offer into envy. QUEEN KATHERINE. Ye turn me into nothing. Woe upon ye And all such false professors! Would you have me-- If you have any justice, any pity; If ye be anything but churchmen's habits-- Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me? Alas, he's banish'd me his bed already, His love, too, long ago! I am old, my lords, And all the fellowship I hold now with him Is only my obedience. What can happen To me above this wretchedness? All your studies Make me a curse like this. CAMPEIUS. Your fears are worse. QUEEN KATHERINE. Have I liv'd thus long--let me speak myself, Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one? A woman, I dare say without vain-glory, Never yet branded with suspicion? Have I with all my full affections Still met the King? lov'd him next Heav'n? obey'd him? Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him? Almost forgot my prayers to content him? And am I thus rewarded! 'Tis not well, lords. Bring me a constant woman to her husband, One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure; And to that woman, when she has done most, Yet will I add an honour,--a great patience. WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at. QUEEN KATHERINE. My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty, To give up willingly that noble title Your master wed me to. Nothing but death Shall e'er divorce my dignities. WOLSEY. Pray hear me. QUEEN KATHERINE. Would I had never trod this English earth, Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it! Ye have angels' faces, but Heaven knows your hearts. What will become of me now, wretched lady! I am the most unhappy woman living. Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes! Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity, No friends, no hope; no kindred weep for me; Almost no grave allow'd me. Like the lily, That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd, I'll hang my head and perish. WOLSEY. If your Grace Could but be brought to know our ends are honest, You'd feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady, Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places, The way of our profession is against it; We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em. For goodness' sake, consider what you do; How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly Grow from the King's acquaintance, by this carriage. The hearts of princes kiss obedience, So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits They swell, and grow as terrible as storms. I know you have a gentle, noble temper, A soul as even as a calm; pray, think us Those we profess, peacemakers, friends, and servants. CAMPEIUS. Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues With these weak women's fears. A noble spirit As yours was, put into you, ever casts Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you; Beware you lose it not. For us, if you please To trust us in your business, we are ready To use our utmost studies in your service. QUEEN KATHERINE. Do what ye will, my lords; and, pray, forgive me If I have us'd myself unmannerly; You know I am a woman, lacking wit To make a seemly answer to such persons. Pray, do my service to his Majesty; He has my heart yet, and shall have my prayers While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers, Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs, That little thought, when she set footing here, She should have bought her dignities so dear. [Exeunt.]  "

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 13," The centaur leaves them on the farther shore of the river of boiling blood, and they set out through a strange, barren woods of trees with dingy leaves and poisonous thorns, where Harpies, half human, half bird, lament. This is the second round, Virgil tells Dante. Dante hears wailing but sees no one and is bewildered. Virgil tells him to break off a twig from one of the trees; immediately blood and a voice come out of the wound, asking why Dante is adding to his torment. The speaker turns out to be a famous statesman and poet named Pier delle Vigne, who had served an emperor and been imprisoned on charges of treachery. He killed himself in despair. Now he explains that he had never betrayed his master, and is glad to think that Dante will tell the truth about him when he returns to the world of living souls. He tells how those who have been violent against their own bodies here become thorn trees, and even at the Last Judgment will not again enter their bodies-only each dead body will be hung on the tree of the soul who threw it away. Then crashing through the woods, wounding all the trees on their way, come two of those here punished for wantonly throwing away all their own goods and destroying their lives that way, pursued by great black hounds who tear them apart. Analysis Those in this strange and eerie wood re-suffer the violence they inflicted on themselves forever. Much as Dante admired and pitied Pier delle Vigne, he did not feel he could show him as being spared the fate he had chosen when he killed himself, so the story goes, by dashing his head against the wall of his cell. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 13," 1. In this Canto is described the punishment of those who had laid violent hands on themselves or their property. 2. Chaucer, Knights Tale, 1977:--  ""First on the wall was peinted a forest, In which ther wonneth neyther man ne best, With knotty knarry barrein trees old Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to behold; In which there ran a romble and a swough As though a storme shuld bresten every bough."" 9. The Cecina is a small river running into the Mediterranean not many miles south of Leghorn; Corneto, a village in the Papal States, north of Civita Vecchia. The country is wild and thinly peopled, and studded with thickets, the haunts of the deer and the wild boar. This region is the fatal Maremma, thus described by Forsyth, Italy, p. 156:-- ""Farther south is the Maremma, a region which, though now worse than a desert, is supposed to have been anciently both fertile and healthy. The Maremma certainly formed part of that Etruria which was called from its harvests the annonaria. Old Roman cisterns may still be traced, and the ruins of Populonium are still visible in the worst part of this tract: yet both nature and man seem to have conspired against it. ""Sylla threw this maritime part of Tuscany into enormous latifundia for his disbanded soldiers. Similar distributions continued to lessen its population during the Empire. In the younger Pliny's time the climate was pestilential. The Lombards gave it a new aspect of misery. Wherever they found culture they built castles, and to each castle they allotted a `bandita' or military fief. Hence baronial wars which have left so many picturesque ruins on the hills, and such desolation round them. Whenever a baron was conquered, his vassals escaped to the cities, and the vacant fief was annexed to the victorious. Thus stripped of men, the lands returned into a state of nature: some were flooded by the rivers, others grew into horrible forests, which enclose and concentrate the pestilence of the lakes and marshes. ""In some parts the water is brackish, and lies lower than the sea: in others it oozes full of tartar from beds oftravertine. At the bottom or on the sides of hills are a multitude of hot springs, which form pools, called Lagoni. A few of these are said to produce borax: some, which are called fumache, exhale sulphur; others, called bulicami, boil with a mephitic gas. The very air above is only a pool of vapors, which sometimes undulate, but seldom flow off. It draws corruption from a rank, unshorn, rotting vegetation, from reptiles and fish both living and dead. ""All nature conspires to drive man away from this fatal region; but man will ever return to his bane, if it be well baited. The Casentine peasants still migrate hither in the winter to feed their cattle: and here they sow corn, make charcoal, saw wood, cut hoops, and peel cork. When summer returns they decamp, but often too late; for many leave their corpses on the road, or bring home the Maremmian disease."" 11. Aeneid, III., Davidson's Tr.:-- ""The shores of the Strophades first receive me rescued from the waves. The Strophades, so called by a Greek name, are islands situated in the great Ionian Sea; which direful Celaeno and the other Harpies inhabit, from what time Phineus' palace was closed against them, and they were frightened from his table, which they formerly haunted. No monster more fell than they, no plague and scourge of the gods more cruel, ever issued from the Stygian waves. They are fowls with virgin faces, most loathsome is their bodily discharge, hands hooked, and looks ever pale with famine. Hither conveyed, as soon as we entered the port, lo! we observe joyous herds of cattle roving up and down the plains, and flocks of goats along the meadows without a keeper. We rush upon them with our swords, and invoke the gods and Jove himself to share the booty. Then along the winding shore we raise the couches, and feast on the rich repast. But suddenly, with direful swoop, the Harpies are upon us from the mountains, shake their wings with loud din, prey upon our banquet, and defile everything with their touch: at the same time, together with a rank smell, hideous screams arise."" 21. His words in the Aeneid, III., Davidson's Tr.:-- ""Near at hand there chanced to be a rising ground, on whose top were young cornel-trees, and a myrtle rough with thick, spear- like branches. I came up to it, and attempting to tear from the earth the verdant wood, that I might cover the altars with the leafy boughs, I observe a dreadful prodigy, and wondrous to relate. For from that tree which first is torn from the soil, its rooted fibres being burst asunder, drops of black blood distil, and stain the ground with gore: cold terror shakes my limbs, and my chill blood is congealed with fear. I again essay to tear off a limber bough from another, and thoroughly explore the latent cause: and from the rind of that other the purple blood descends. Raising in my mind many an anxious thought, I with reverence besought the rural nymphs, and father Mars, who presides over the Thracian territories, kindly to prosper the vision and avert evil from the omen. But when I attempted the boughs a third time with a more vigorous effort, and on my knees struggled against the opposing mould, (shall I speak, or shall I forbear?) a piteous groan is heard from the bottom of the rising ground, and a voice sent forth reaches my ears: `Aeneas, why dost thou tear an unhappy wretch? Spare me, now that I am in my grave; forbear to pollute with guilt thy pious hands: Troy brought me forth no stranger to you; nor is it from the trunk this blood distils.'"" 40. Chaucer, Knightes Tale, 2339:--  ""And as it queinte, it made a whisteling As don these brondes wet in hir brenning, And at the brondes ende outran anon As it were blody dropes many on."" See also Spenser, Faerie Queene, I. ii. 30. 58. Pietro della Vigna, Chancellor of the Emperor Frederick II. Napier's account of him is as follows, Florentine History, I. 197-- ""The fate of his friend and minister, Piero delle Vigne of Capua, if truly told, would nevertheless impress us with an unfavorable idea of his mercy and magnanimity: Piero was sent with Taddeo di Sessa as Frederick's advocate and representative to the Council of Lyons, which was assembled by his friend Innocent the Fourth, nominally to reform the Church, but really to impart more force and solemnity to a fresh sentence of excommunication and deposition. There Taddeo spoke with force and boldness for his master; but Piero was silent; and hence he was accused of being, like several others, bribed by the Pope, not only to desert the Emperor, but to attempt his life; and whether he were really culpable, or the victim of court intrigue, is still doubtful. Frederick, on apparently good evidence, condemned him to have his eyes burned out, and the sentence was executed at San Miniato al Tedesco: being afterwards sent on horseback to Pisa, where he was hated, as an object for popular derison, he died, as is conjectured, from the effects of a fall while thus cruelly exposed, and not by his own hand, as Dante believed and sung."" Milman, Latin Christianity, V. 499, gives the story thus:-- ""Peter de Vine#a had been raised by the wise choice of Frederick to the highest rank and influence. All the acts of Frederick were attributed to his Chancellor. De Vine#a, like his master, was a poet; he was one of the counsellors in his great scheme of legislation. Some rumors spread abroad that at the Council of Lyons, though Frederick had forbidden all his representatives from holding private intercourse with the Pope, De Vine#a had many secret conferences with Innocent, and was accused of betraying his master's interests. Yet there was no seeming diminution in the trust placed in De Vine#a. Still, to the end the Emperor's letters concerning the disaster at Parma are by the same hand. Over the cause of his disgrace and death, even in his own day, there was deep doubt and obscurity. The popular rumor ran that Frederick was ill; the physician of De Vine#a prescribed for him; the Emperor having received some warning, addressed De Vine#a: `My friend, in thee I have full trust; art thou sure that this is medicine, not poison?' De Vine#a replied: `How often has my physician ministered healthful medicines!--why are you now afraid?' Frederick took the cup, sternly commanded the physician to drink half of it. The physician threw himself at the King's feet, and, he fell, overthrew the liquor. But what was left was administered to some criminals, who died in agony. The Emperor wrung his hands and wept bitterly: `Whom can I now trust, betrayed by my own familiar friend? Never can I know security, never can I know joy more.' By one account Peter de Vine#a was led ignominiously on an ass through Pisa, and thrown into prison, where he dashed his brains out against the wall. Dante's immortal verse has saved the fame of De Vine#a: according to the poet he was the victim of wicked and calumnious jealousy."" See also Giuseppe de Blasiis, Vita et Opere di Pietro della Vigna. 112. Iliad, XII. 146: ""Like two wild boars, which catch the coming tumult of men and dogs in the mountains, and, advancing obliquely to the attack, break down the wood about them, cutting it off at the roots."" Chaucer, Legende of Goode Women:--  Envie ys lavendere of the court alway; For she ne parteth neither nyght ne day Out of the house of Cesar, thus saith Daunte."" 120. ""Lano,"" says Boccaccio, Comento, ""was young gentleman of Siena, who had a large patrimony, and associating himself with a club of other young Sienese, called the Spendthrift Club, they also being all rich, together with them, not spending but squandering, in a short time he consumed all that he had and became very poor. "" Joining some Florentine troops sent out against the Aretines, he was in a skirmish at the parish of Toppo, which Dante calls a joust; ""and notwithstanding he might have saved himself,"" continues Boccaccio, ""remembering his wretched condition, and it seeming to him a grievous thing to bear poverty, as he had been very rich, he rushed into the thick of the enemy and was slain, as perhaps he desired to be."" 125. Some commentators interpret these dogs as poverty and despair, still pursuing their victims. The Ottimo Comento calls them ""poor men who, to follow pleasure and the kitchens of other people, abandoned their homes and families, and are therefore transformed into hunting dogs, and pursue and devour their masters."" 133. Jacopo da St. Andrea was a Paduan of like character and life as Lano. ""Among his other squanderings,"" says the Ottimo Comento, ""it is said that, wishing to see a grand and beautiful fire, he had one of his own villas burned."" 143. Florence was first under the protection of the god Mars; afterwards under that of St. John the Baptist. But in Dante's time the statue of Mars was still standing on a column at the head of the Ponte Vecchio. It was over thrown by an inundation of the Arno in 1333. See Canto XV. Note 62. 149. Florence was destroyed by Totila in 450, and never by Attila. In Dante's time the two seem to have been pretty generally confounded. The Ottimo Comento remarks upon this point, ""Some say that Totila was one person and Attila another; and some say that he was one and the same man."" 150. Dante does not mention the name of this suicide; Boccaccio thinks, for one of two reasons; ""either out of regard of his surviving relatives, who peradventure are honorable men, and therefore he did not wish to stain them with the infamy of so dishonest a death, or else (as in those times, as if by a malediction sent by God upon our city, many hanged themselves) that each one might apply it to either he pleased of these many.""

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 1,"  Note: All page numbers in this summary and analysis refer to the edition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s  published in 2009 by Fall River Press. This NovelGuide also draws on Leslie S. Klinger, ed., The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes: The Novels (New York and London: W.W. Norton, 2006). Citations reading “Klinger” refer to this reference work. : Mr. Sherlock Holmes : On a morning in 1879, John Watson, M.D., awakes to find the private detective Sherlock Holmes, with whom he shares lodgings at 221-B Baker Street, unexpectedly seated at the breakfast table. Holmes invites Watson to examine a walking stick left behind by an unmet visitor the previous night. What, Holmes wonders, can Watson deduce about the stick’s owner? Watson hazards his observations, only to have them clarified and corrected by Holmes, his deductive superior. Shortly thereafter, the walking stick’s owner, one James Mortimer, M.R.C.S. (Member of the Royal College of Surgeons), arrives. After exclaiming his delight at having the chance to observe Holmes’ skull (for he has heard of the detective’s brilliant intellect), he proceeds to tell Holmes and Watson why he is seeking the master detective’s help. Analysis: Having grown tired of writing the adventures of the world’s first consulting detective and eager to turn his attention to more “serious” literature, Arthur Conan Doyle attempted to finish off his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, by sending him over the Reichenbach Falls as the detective grappled with his archnemesis, Professor Moriarty, in a short story entitled “The Final Problem” (December 1893). The title would, of course, prove overly optimistic! Enthusiastic readers of the Holmes tales clamored for the sleuth’s return. Conan Doyle obliged with , the third—and still hailed by many critics as the best—Sherlock Holmes novel. Conan Doyle did, however, carefully label the book as “another adventure” of Holmes of the first edition’s title page—an indication that the events in its pages took place prior to “The Final Problem,” and that the reading public should not expect any further stories. When the novel proved an instant success, however, readers pressed for more. Conan Doyle relented and engineered Holmes’ “resurrection” in 1903. The first chapter of the present work appropriately bears Holmes’ name as its title, for it is largely a brief character sketch of the detective, introducing him or reintroducing him to the book’s audience through the eyes of his erstwhile companion, Dr. John Watson. The chapter also introduces James Mortimer, an adherent of phrenology, the now-discredited belief prevalent in Victorian science, that study of the shape of the skull indicates mental capacity and even moral character. “You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes,” Mortimer announces. “I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic [i.e., relatively long] a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital [i.e., above the eyeballs] development” (p. 18). The comment is exactly the kind of thing one would expect a self-professed (and perhaps not a little self-important) “dabbler in science” to say (p. 18). Mortimer also manages the relatively uncommon feat of being able to wound Holmes’ pride when he declares Holmes “the second highest expert in Europe” (p. 19). Mortimer ranks Holmes behind Alphonse Bertillon, “chief of criminal investigation for the Paris police from 1880” (Klinger, 397). Bertillon’s method of photographing and measuring the distinctive physical traits of criminal suspects—in profile and full-on views, the basis for the modern “mug shot”—proved highly influential in police practice worldwide, only to be superseded by the advent of fingerprinting at the turn of the 20th century. Fortunately for Mortimer, his conviction that Holmes remains the most knowledgeable “practical man of affairs” (p. 19) ensures that Holmes will give Mortimer’s case a hearing. Mortimer demurs when Holmes addresses him as “doctor.” According to Klinger, Mortimer’s M.R.C.S. credentials are today “regarded as a specialist higher qualification in surgery, awarded to doctors who have already qualified in their profession and have elected to practice in the surgical branch of it… In Mortimer’s day [, however], the M.R.C.S. was the surgical half of the standard qualification to practice, not an advanced degree, and surgeons in fact occupied a lower position in the medical hierarchy than physicians, who diagnosed patients and prescribed medication” (pp. 388-89).   ",The Hound of the Baskervilles,Chapter 1, byA.

The Red Badge of Courage : Novel Summary: Chapter 13-15,"Henry makes his way apprehensively to towards his old comrades. He fears the reception he may receive. The first soldier he encounters is his friend Wilson, who greets him warmly. He had assumed that Henry had been killed. Henry makes up a convincing tale about being separated from the regiment, being involved in terrible fighting, and getting shot. A corporal arrives and takes care of Henry. He dresses the wound and says it appears that Henry was grazed by a cannon ball. After the corporal leaves him, Henry sits on the ground observing the scene around him. Then Wilson arrives, and tries to help Henry by tying a wet, cool handkerchief around his swollen head. Wilson then gives Henry his own blankets, and will not listen to Henry’s protests about his generosity. Henry sleeps. He wakes in the morning and already there is a distant sound of battle. There are bugle calls and drum rolls. Wilson watches out for Henry’s needs as they gather around the camp fire for breakfast. Henry notices how much his formerly loud and aggressive friend has matured. He is quieter, more confident, less ready to quarrel. Wilson says the officers believe they have the rebels where they want them. He adds that he thinks they gave the opposing army a defeat the previous day. Henry replies that from where he was, it looked the other way round. Then he remembers Jim Conklin, and tells Wilson about his death. A quarrel springs up between three soldiers, and Wilson goes across to become the peacemaker. When he returns he comments to Henry that initially he had thought the regiment had lost half its men in the battle. But it turns out they had only been scattered, and were wandering around or fighting with other regiments. Most of them had now returned. Henry remembers the package Wilson gave to him, when the latter had spoken with self-pity about what he believed would be his imminent death in battle. But he decides not to give the package back to Wilson straightaway. He fears that at some point Wilson will expect Henry to tell him his adventures of the previous day, and the truth may come out. He realizes that his possession of the package gives him some power over Wilson, so he resolves to keep it. If anyone will be the subject of derision, he determines it will be Wilson, not himself. Now he considers himself safe from discovery, his self-confidence and self-respect return. He does not fear what may happen in the forthcoming battle. He again reassures himself that even though he had fled the previous day, he had done so with discretion and dignity, not like the other deserters. As Henry thinks these thoughts, Wilson approaches him, and in an embarrassed way asks for his package back. Henry does not make it difficult for him, and congratulates himself on his generosity. He feels superior to his friend. Analysis It appears from the comments made by the corporal, and later by Wilson, that the number of men from Henry’s regiment who ran from the battle was high. This is clear from the corporal’s statement that he thought at first they had lost forty-two men, but many of them are now returning. He does not draw the conclusion that the men deserted. Nor does Wilson, when in a separate incident he says to Henry: “Th’regiment lost over half th’ men yesterday. . . . I thought a’ course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep a-comin’ back last night until it seems, after all, we didn’t lose but a few.” He goes on to explain that the regiment had been scattered, and many of the men believed lost had in fact been fighting with other regiments—just as Henry had done. The irony here is rich. Not only does Wilson not doubt Henry’s story, it seems not to occur to him that the men who were scattered in fact deserted. Although the truth that some men in the regiment are cowards is plain, no one is willing to draw that conclusion. Of course, this is very convenient for Henry and plays a part in restoring his confidence. He guesses he will not be found out. The maturing of Wilson after the battle is notable. The experience has changed him for the better. He no longer has to prove himself and is a better man as a result. Henry is observant enough to note the change. It is ironic, then, that Henry maneuvers himself into a position where he can feel superior to Wilson. This is the incident with the package. The reader will hardly feel that Henry is justified in his attitude. Wilson may have had a moment of self-pity but at least he did his duty. But now it is he who feels shame rather than Henry, who is busy puffing himself up with images of his own superiority and imagining all the great war stories he will tell, with himself at the center, when he returns home to family and friends.

By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.  SIR TOBY. Why, let her except before excepted.  MARIA. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.  SIR TOBY. Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.  MARIA. That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.  SIR TOBY. Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?  MARIA. Ay, he.  SIR TOBY. He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.  MARIA. What's that to th' purpose?  SIR TOBY. Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.  MARIA. Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats; he's a very fool and a prodigal.  SIR TOBY. Fie that you'll say so! He plays o' th' viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.  MARIA. He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

Good Mistress Mary Accost-  SIR Toby. You mistake, knight. 'Accost' is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.  AGUECHEEK. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?  MARIA. Fare you well, gentlemen.  SIR TOBY. An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again!  AGUECHEEK. An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?  MARIA. Sir, I have not you by th' hand.  AGUECHEEK. Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.  MARIA. Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th' buttry-bar and let it drink.  AGUECHEEK. Wherefore, sweetheart? What's your metaphor?  MARIA. It's dry, sir.  AGUECHEEK. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?  MARIA. A dry jest, sir.  AGUECHEEK.

When did I see thee so put down?  AGUECHEEK. Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.  SIR TOBY. No question.  AGUECHEEK. An I thought that, I'd forswear it. I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.  SIR TOBY. Pourquoi, my dear knight?  AGUECHEEK. What is 'pourquoi'- do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. Oh, had I but followed the arts!  SIR TOBY. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.  AGUECHEEK. Why, would that have mended my hair?  SIR TOBY. Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.  AGUECHEEK. But it becomes me well enough, does't not?  SIR TOBY. Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff, and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off.  AGUECHEEK. Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her.  SIR TOBY. She'll none o' th' Count; she'll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.  AGUECHEEK. I'll stay a month longer.

As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.  SIR TOBY. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?  AGUECHEEK. Faith, I can cut a caper.  SIR TOBY. And I can cut the mutton to't.  AGUECHEEK. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.  SIR TOBY. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form'd under the star of a galliard.  AGUECHEEK. Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in flame-colour'd stock. Shall we set about some revels?  SIR TOBY. What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?  AGUECHEEK. Taurus? That's sides and heart.  SIR TOBY. No, sir; it is legs and thighs.

Henry VIII: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 1,"    The play opens in a room at the court of King , in London. The Duke of Norfolk meets the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Abergavenny. Buckingham asks Norfolk how he has been since they last met in France. Norfolk replies that he is well, and still admires what he saw there. They had accompanied the king to a great display of wealth and military prowess by England and France, which took place in a field in France. Norfolk describes the impressive scene to Buckingham, who had missed everything through illness. Buckingham asks who organized the event, and Norfolk says it was Cardinal Wolsey, the king's chief advisor. Buckingham voices his contempt and dislike for Wolsey as an ambitious, meddling self-seeker, and condemns the event in France as ""vanities."" Norfolk is more conciliatory, pointing out that Wolsey lacks the example lent by noble ancestors and experienced assistants; he is a self-made man and has only his own resources to rely on. Abergavenny joins in with Buckingham's condemnation of Wolsey, criticising his pride, which he says is ""from hell."" Buckingham adds that Wolsey did not seek the king's permission when deciding who should go to France. Wolsey made the nobles pay for the event, yet he gave least honor to those who paid most. Abergavenny confirms that several of his relatives funded the event by selling part of their estates, which would never recover. Buckingham says the event resulted only in a massive waste of money and empty talk. Norfolk agrees that the peace between England and France does not justify such a cost. In any case, France has broken the agreement by seizing British merchants' goods at Bordeaux. But he warns Buckingham to be careful, since Wolsey is a powerful and vengeful man. They are interrupted by the arrival of Wolsey with his guards and secretaries. Wolsey and Buckingham glare at each other. Wolsey asks a secretary if Buckingham's former Surveyor (estate overseer), who has come to give evidence against him, has arrived. The secretary says he has, and Wolsey leaves with his party. Buckingham fears that Wolsey is plotting against him. He thinks he is on his way to the king to stir up trouble for him, and decides to follow him. But Norfolk warns Buckingham against this, advising him to calm down and show restraint. Buckingham takes his advice, though he says he has proof that Wolsey is corrupt and treasonous. Norfolk is shocked by the accusation of treason, but Buckingham insists that he will say as much to the king, and provide proof. Buckingham enumerates Wolsey's faults: he is greedy, cunning, and given to mischief; he organized the French event simply to show off his high status in France as well as England; and he drew up the France-England treaty that was agreed there to suit his own ends. He also deals with Queen Katherine's nephew, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and king of Spain, behind King Henry's back. Charles had been worried at the prospect of England forming an alliance with France, as it would threaten Spain's interests. Wolsey, says Buckingham, buys and sells the king's honor for his own advantage. At that moment, Brandon, the sergeant-at-arms, comes in with the Guard, and arrests Buckingham in the name of the king, on the charge of high treason. Buckingham is certain that Wolsey has arranged this. He says goodbye to Abergavenny, but Brandon says he has come to arrest him too, along with others among their friends. Buckingham says that Wolsey must have bribed the Surveyor to incriminate him. As the prisoners are taken to be locked up in the Tower of London, Buckingham believes his life is over. Analysis The Prologue sets the scene for the play, making clear that its purpose is to present historical truth and arouse pity for those powerful people who have fallen. The play covers some years of the reign of King  up to the birth of his daughter, the future Queen Elizabeth I, by his second wife, Anne Boleyn. The first scene establishes the character of Wolsey as seen from the point of view of his enemy, Buckingham. We do not yet know how objectively true Buckingham's opinion is. Certain aspects of his tirade against Wolsey betray the prejudice of the noble (Buckingham) for the self-made humbly born man (Wolsey). Wolsey was reported to be the son of a butcher, so Buckingham calls him a ""butcher's cur"" (line 120) and invokes the traditional distinction of rank to ""cry down"" ""This Ipswich fellow's insolence"" (lines 137-8). His attitude reflects the widespread alarm among the nobility in Tudor times at the rise of a wealthy merchant middle-class and a more flexible class and education system that allowed low-class men like Wolsey to attain high office. However, Buckingham's accusations of ruthlessness and cunning are backed up by Wolsey's hostile attitude to him during his brief appearance, along with the arrrest of Buckingham at the end of the scene. It is significant too that at his arrest, Buckingham is accused of exactly the same crime of which he had previously accused Wolsey. The impression given is that Wolsey has both spied upon and plotted against Buckingham. Also striking is the fact that Buckingham claims he has proof of Wolsey's treason, yet Wolsey has as yet presented no evidence of Buckingham's treason - but Wolsey is nevertheless able to have Buckingham arrested for treason. This shows that the power lies with Wolsey, not with the likes of Buckingham and those nobly born friends of his who are also arrested. The Prologue had warned that the play would show us ""How soon this mightiness meets misery,"" or the fall of powerful people. Buckingham is the first to fall, through the intervention of Wolsey. The display of military achievement by the royal courts of France and England referred to in this scene is known to historians as the Field of the Cloth of Gold, after the rich materials of the tents set up to accommodate the royals and nobles who attended. The event took place in 1520 against the background of a triangular power struggle in Europe between the great powers of the time - France (ruled by King Francis I), Spain (ruled by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, also the nephew of King 's wife Katherine), and the newcomer, England. France and Spain vied with each other for an alliance with England to swing the balance of power in their favor. Wolsey favored an allliance with France, but Katherine favored an alliance with her home country of Spain. The Field of the Cloth of Gold, where King  of England and King Francis I of France agreed in principle to an alliance, appeared to be a victory for Wolsey, but it was somewhat tainted and short-lived. The event severely strained the finances of both countries and the results were negligible. Shortly after, Henry met Charles V in England and signed a treaty with the Empire. Over the next few years, treaties between the three countries were signed and broken with wearisome regularity, with the result that no one power gained ascendancy.

ACT I. SCENE 1. London. An ante-chamber in the palace. [Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.] BUCKINGHAM. Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done Since last we saw in France? NORFOLK. I thank your Grace, Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw there. BUCKINGHAM An untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, Met in the vale of Andren. NORFOLK. 'Twixt Guynes and Arde. I was then present, saw them salute on horseback; Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung In their embracement, as they grew together; Which had they, what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd Such a compounded one? BUCKINGHAM All the whole time I was my chamber's prisoner. NORFOLK. Then you lost The view of earthly glory. Men might say, Till this time pomp was single, but now married To one above itself. Each following day Became the next day's master, till the last Made former wonders its. To-day the French, All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods, Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they Made Britain India: every man that stood Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were As cherubins, all gilt; the madams too, Not us'd to toil, did almost sweat to bear The pride upon them, that their very labour Was to them as a painting. Now this masque Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings, Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst, As presence did present them; him in eye, Still him in praise; and, being present both, 'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-- For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challeng'd The noble spirits to arms, they did perform Beyond thought's compass, that former fabulous story, Being now seen possible enough, got credit, That Bevis was believ'd. BUCKINGHAM O, you go far! NORFOLK. As I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything Would by a good discourser lose some life, Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal; To the disposing of it nought rebell'd, Order gave each thing view; the office did Distinctly his full function. BUCKINGHAM Who did guide, I mean, who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together, as you guess? NORFOLK. One, certes, that promises no element In such a business. BUCKINGHAM I pray you, who, my lord? NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. BUCKINGHAM The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed From his ambitious finger. What had he To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun, And keep it from the earth. NORFOLK. Surely, sir, There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends; For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon For high feats done to the crown; neither allied To eminent assistants; but, spider-like, Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note, The force of his own merit makes his way; A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys A place next to the King. ABERGAVENNY. I cannot tell What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye Pierce into that; but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that? If not from hell, the devil is a niggard, Or has given all before, and he begins A new hell in himself. BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil, Upon this French going out, took he upon him, Without the privity o' the King, to appoint Who should attend on him? He makes up the file Of all the gentry; for the most part such To whom as great a charge as little honour He meant to lay upon; and his own letter, The honourable board of council out, Must fetch him in he papers. ABERGAVENNY. I do know Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have By this so sicken'd their estates, that never They shall abound as formerly. BUCKINGHAM. O, many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey. What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issue? NORFOLK. Grievingly I think The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it. BUCKINGHAM. Every man, After the hideous storm that follow'd, was A thing inspir'd; and, not consulting, broke Into a general prophecy, that this tempest, Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded The sudden breach on't. NORFOLK. Which is budded out; For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd Our merchants' goods at Bordeaux. ABERGAVENNY. Is it therefore The ambassador is silenc'd? NORFOLK. Marry, is't. ABERGAVENNY. A proper title of a peace, and purchas'd At a superfluous rate! BUCKINGHAM. Why, all this business Our reverend Cardinal carried. NORFOLK. Like it your Grace, The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you-- And take it from a heart that wishes towards you Honour and plenteous safety--that you read The Cardinal's malice and his potency Together, to consider further that What his high hatred would effect wants not A minister in his power. You know his nature, That he's revengeful, and I know his sword Hath a sharp edge; it's long, and, 't may be said, It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend, Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel, You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock That I advise your shunning. [Enter Cardinal Wolsey, the purse borne before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries, with papers. The Cardinal in his passage fixeth his eye on Buckingham, and Buckingham on him, both full of disdain.] WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha? Where's his examination? SECRETARY. Here, so please you. WOLSEY. Is he in person ready? SECRETARY. Ay, please your Grace. WOLSEY. Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham Shall lessen this big look. [Exeunt Wolsey and his train.] BUCKINGHAM. This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book Outworths a noble's blood. NORFOLK. What, are you chaf'd? Ask God for temp'rance; that's the appliance only Which your disease requires. BUCKINGHAM. I read in 's looks Matter against me, and his eye revil'd Me as his abject object. At this instant He bores me with some trick. He's gone to the King; I'll follow, and outstare him. NORFOLK. Stay, my lord, And let your reason with your choler question What 'tis you go about. To climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like A full hot horse, who being allow'd his way, Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England Can advise me like you; be to yourself As you would to your friend. BUCKINGHAM. I'll to the King, And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow's insolence, or proclaim There's difference in no persons. NORFOLK. Be advis'd; Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself. We may outrun, By violent swiftness, that which we run at, And lose by over-running. Know you not, The fire that mounts the liquor till 't run o'er, In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis'd. I say again, there is no English soul More stronger to direct you than yourself, If with the sap of reason you would quench, Or but allay, the fire of passion. BUCKINGHAM. Sir, I am thankful to you; and I'll go along By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow, Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but From sincere motions, by intelligence, And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravel, I do know To be corrupt and treasonous. NORFOLK. Say not ""treasonous."" BUCKINGHAM. To the King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox, Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief As able to perform't; his mind and place Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-- Only to show his pomp as well in France As here at home, suggests the King our master To this last costly treaty, the interview, That swallowed so much treasure, and like a glass Did break i' the rinsing. NORFOLK. Faith, and so it did. BUCKINGHAM. Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning Cardinal The articles o' the combination drew As himself pleas'd; and they were ratified As he cried ""Thus let be,"" to as much end As give a crutch to the dead. But our count-cardinal Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey, Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,-- Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy To the old dam, treason,--Charles the Emperor, Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt,-- For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation. His fears were, that the interview betwixt England and France might, through their amity, Breed him some prejudice; for from this league Peep'd harms that menac'd him. He privily Deals with our Cardinal; and, as I trow,-- Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor Paid ere he promis'd; whereby his suit was granted Ere it was ask'd--but when the way was made, And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd, That he would please to alter the King's course, And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know, As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases And for his own advantage. NORFOLK. I am sorry To hear this of him; and could wish he were Something mistaken in't. BUCKINGHAM. No, not a syllable: I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof. [Enter Brandon, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard.] BRANDON. Your office, sergeant; execute it. SERGEANT. Sir, My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I Arrest thee of high treason, in the name Of our most sovereign king. BUCKINGHAM. Lo, you, my lord, The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish Under device and practice. BRANDON. I am sorry To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on The business present. 'Tis his Highness' pleasure You shall to the Tower. BUCKINGHAM. It will help nothing To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of Heaven Be done in this and all things! I obey. O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well! BRANDON. Nay, he must bear you company. [To Abergavenny.] The King Is pleas'd you shall to the Tower, till you know How he determines further. ABERGAVENNY. As the Duke said, The will of Heaven be done, and the King's pleasure By me obey'd! BRANDON. Here is warrant from The King to attach Lord Montacute, and the bodies Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car, One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor,-- BUCKINGHAM. So, so; These are the limbs o' the plot. No more, I hope? BRANDON. A monk o' the Chartreux. BUCKINGHAM O, Nicholas Hopkins? BRANDON. He. BUCKINGHAM. My surveyor is false; the o'er-great Cardinal Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already. I am the shadow of poor Buckingham, Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on, By dark'ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell. [Exeunt.]  "

Before him and behind: above, below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes. He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still. A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there were many there--could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned. As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge. Hush! They only sought permission to retire. He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it. He looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done. In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another. Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to think again. At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty. The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday. The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man--an old man--and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again. The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed. They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison. Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there--alone. He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead--that was the end. To be hanged by the neck till he was dead. As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes! Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very spot. It was very dark; why didn't they bring a light? The cell had been built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light! At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more. Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day. To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning. The day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off. Saturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of this, the day broke--Sunday. It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had sat there, awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such sights--recoiled from him with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together. He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight--nine--then. If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other's heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven-- Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him. From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness. The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the lodge. 'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?' said the man whose duty it was to conduct them. 'It's not a sight for children, sir.' 'It is not indeed, my friend,' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; 'but my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he should see him now.' These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells. 'This,' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--'this is the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.' He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards. There were putting up the scaffold. From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell. They did so. The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision. 'Good boy, Charley--well done--' he mumbled. 'Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha! Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to bed!' The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking. 'Take him away to bed!' cried Fagin. 'Do you hear me, some of you? He has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this. It's worth the money to bring him up to it--Bolter's throat, Bill; never mind the girl--Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!' 'Fagin,' said the jailer. 'That's me!' cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial. 'An old man, my Lord; a very old, old man!' 'Here,' said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down. 'Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?' 'I shan't be one long,' he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror. 'Strike them all dead! What right have they to butcher me?' As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there. 'Steady,' said the turnkey, still holding him down. 'Now, sir, tell him what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.' 'You have some papers,' said Mr. Brownlow advancing, 'which were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.' 'It's all a lie together,' replied Fagin. 'I haven't one--not one.' 'For the love of God,' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, 'do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain. Where are those papers?' 'Oliver,' cried Fagin, beckoning to him. 'Here, here! Let me whisper to you.' 'I am not afraid,' said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr. Brownlow's hand. 'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I want to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.' 'Yes, yes,' returned Oliver. 'Let me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.' 'Outside, outside,' replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head. 'Say I've gone to sleep--they'll believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!' 'Oh! God forgive this wretched man!' cried the boy with a burst of tears. 'That's right, that's right,' said Fagin. 'That'll help us on. This door first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don't you mind, but hurry on. Now, now, now!' 'Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?' inquired the turnkey. 'No other question,' replied Mr. Brownlow. 'If I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position--' 'Nothing will do that, sir,' replied the man, shaking his head. 'You had better leave him.' The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned. 'Press on, press on,' cried Fagin. 'Softly, but not so slow. Faster, faster!' The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard. It was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk. Day was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all--the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death. CHAPTER LIII AND LAST The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words. Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home. Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed. It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father's will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded. Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin's gang. Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world. Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority. Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour. Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work. After some consideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife. As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong. Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire. And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures. I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would fain recall them every one. How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them--these are all matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained. Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word: 'AGNES.' There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.  "
Wuthering Heights: Novel Summary: Chapters 9-10," Ellen tells Catherine to be quiet, as Joseph is near and that means Heathcliff will be coming. Catherine is worried that Heathcliff may have heard her and says that she will never forsake Heathcliff. She would not marry Edgar if it meant that she and Heathcliff would be separated. She thinks that if she married Heathcliff they would be beggars, and if she marries Linton, she can help Heathcliff to rise and get him away from her brother. When Joseph comes in looking for Heathcliff, Ellen calls for him outside but gets no answer. She then tells Catherine that he had heard some of what she said, and she gets frightened. Catherine runs outside to look for Heathcliff, and finally comes back, saying she will not go upstairs until she gets to talk to him. She paces the floor, and they all wait, and Catherine stays outside crying when it starts to rain. At midnight, the storm comes, and the wind is violent. Ellen tries to talk Catherine into taking off her wet things and going to bed, but she won't. The next morning Catherine is quite distraught over Heathcliff and is in fact quite ill. Mrs. Linton comes to visit, and insists that Catherine be taken to Thrushcross Grange until she is well. Later she and her husband both catch the fever though, and die within days of each other. When Catherine comes home, she is saucier and more passionate than ever, and nothing has been heard of Heathcliff since the night he left. Three years later Catherine and Edgar are married. Ellen accompanies Catherine to Thrushcross Grange, and is quite sad to leave five-year-old Hareton behind. Mrs. Dean stops her story, realizing how late it is.  Catherine and Edgar are happy at Thrushcross Grange, and Edgar humors Catherine exceedingly, giving her everything she wants. One day in September as Ellen is gathering apples, she hears someone call her, and finds Heathcliff in the garden. He tells her to go in and tell Catherine that there is someone to see her, but not to say who. She does, and when Catherine comes back after meeting the stranger she is breathless, she is so happy. Edgar does not seem to want to invite him in, and thinks Catherine is being silly. Ellen notices how much Heathcliff has changed. He is an older, well-formed man who is intelligent and dignified. Heathcliff and Catherine become absorbed in each other, and Edgar gets irritated. As he is leaving after tea, Heathcliff tells Ellen that he is going to , as Hindley invited him to stay there. Ellen is quite surprised, and has the feeling that it would have been better if Heathcliff had stayed away. The next day Catherine and Isabella visit , and soon Heathcliff is a regular visitor to Thrushcross Grange. New trouble arises when it becomes clear that Isabella is attracted to Heathcliff. When Catherine confronts her with it, Isabella admits that she loves him. Catherine seriously advises her against it, saying that she does not know Heathcliff at all, and that he could not love her but might marry her for her fortune. Ellen tells Isabella to listen to Catherine. She goes on to say that Heathcliff is not a good man for her, and that she heard from Joseph that he and Hindley do nothing at the Heights but drink and gamble. Edgar is away from home, so Heathcliff calls earlier than normal. Isabella is horrified when Catherine tells him that she is in love with him. He stares at her darkly but does not say anything, and Catherine holds on to her so that she cannot leave. Finally Isabella digs her nails into Catherine so that she will let her go, and she leaves the room. When Catherine tells Heathcliff that he should beware of her talons, he replies that he would wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced [him] (113). Catherine tells Heathcliff that she likes Isabella too much to let him have her, and he says he is not interested, but Ellen can tell that he is still thinking about it. ‹ NovelGuide: : Novel :  up NovelGuide: : Novel : 2 › ",Wuthering Heights,Chapters 9-10,"  HE entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act of stowing his son sway in the kitchen cupboard. Hareton was impressed with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness or his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I chose to put him. 'There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the skin of my neck, like a dog. 'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between you to murder that child! I know how it is, now, that he is always out of my way. But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the carving-knife, Nelly! You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth, head-downmost, in the Black- horse marsh; and two is the same as one - and I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!' 'But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has been cutting red herrings. I'd rather be shot, if you please.' 'You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall. No law in England can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable! Open your mouth.' He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries. I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably - I would not take it on any account. 'Oh!' said he, releasing me, 'I see that hideous little villain is not Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell. If it be, he deserves flaying alive for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin. Unnatural cub, come hither! I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted, deluded father. Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped? It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce - get me a scissors - something fierce and trim! Besides, it's infernal affectation - devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears - we're asses enough without them. Hush, child, hush! Well then, it is my darling! wisht, dry thy eyes - there's a joy; kiss me. What! it won't? Kiss me, Hareton! Damn thee, kiss me! By God, as if I would rear such a monster! As sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.' Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him up- stairs and lifted him over the banister. I cried out that he would frighten the child into fits, and ran to rescue him. As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in his hands. 'Who is that?' he asked, hearing some one approaching the stairs'-foot. I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell. There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw that the little wretch was safe. Heathcliff arrived underneath just at the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the accident. A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five shillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand pounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the figure of Mr. Earnshaw above. It expressed, plainer than words could do, the intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting his own revenge. Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to remedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious charge pressed to my heart. Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered and abashed. 'It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of sight: you should have taken him from me! Is he injured anywhere?' 'Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot! Oh! I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him. You're worse than a heathen - treating your own flesh and blood in that manner!' He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with me, sobbed off his terror directly. At the first finger his father laid on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as if he would go into convulsions. 'You shall not meddle with him!' I continued. 'He hates you - they all hate you - that's the truth! A happy family you have; and a pretty state you're come to!' 'I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man, recovering his hardness. 'At present, convey yourself and him away. And hark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing. I wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire: but that's as my fancy goes.' While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and poured some into a tumbler. 'Nay, don't!' I entreated. 'Mr. Hindley, do take warning. Have mercy on this unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!' 'Any one will do better for him than I shall,' he answered. 'Have mercy on your own soul!' I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass from his hand. 'Not I! On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to perdition to punish its Maker,' exclaimed the blasphemer. 'Here's to its hearty damnation!' He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember. 'It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff, muttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut. 'He's doing his very utmost; but his constitution defies him. Mr. Kenneth says he would wager his mare that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go to the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common course befall him.' I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep. Heathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn. It turned out afterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he flung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained silent. I was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began, -  It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat, The mither beneath the mools heard that,  when Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her head in, and whispered, - 'Are you alone, Nelly?' 'Yes, Miss,' I replied. She entered and approached the hearth. I, supposing she was going to say something, looked up. The expression of her face seemed disturbed and anxious. Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she drew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence. I resumed my song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour. 'Where's Heathcliff?' she said, interrupting me. 'About his work in the stable,' was my answer. He did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze. There followed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two trickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags. Is she sorry for her shameful conduct? - I asked myself. That will be a novelty: but she may come to the point - as she will - I sha'n't help her! No, she felt small trouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns. 'Oh, dear!' she cried at last. 'I'm very unhappy!' 'A pity,' observed I. 'You're hard to please; so many friends and so few cares, and can't make yourself content!' 'Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to indulge it. 'Is it worth keeping?' I inquired, less sulkily. 'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out! I want to know what I should do. To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've given him an answer. Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or denial, you tell me which it ought to have been.' 'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?' I replied. 'To be sure, considering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon, I might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after that, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.' 'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly rising to her feet. 'I accepted him, Nelly. Be quick, and say whether I was wrong!' 'You accepted him! Then what good is it discussing the matter? You have pledged your word, and cannot retract.' 'But say whether I should have done so - do!' she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning. 'There are many things to be considered before that question can be answered properly,' I said, sententiously. 'First and foremost, do you love Mr. Edgar?' 'Who can help it? Of course I do,' she answered. Then I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two it was not injudicious. 'Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?' 'Nonsense, I do - that's sufficient.' 'By no means; you must say why?' 'Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.' 'Bad!' was my commentary. 'And because he is young and cheerful.' 'Bad, still.' 'And because he loves me.' 'Indifferent, coming there.' 'And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the neighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.' 'Worst of all. And now, say how you love him?' 'As everybody loves - You're silly, Nelly.' 'Not at all - Answer.' 'I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and everything he touches, and every word he says. I love all his looks, and all his actions, and him entirely and altogether. There now!' 'And why?' 'Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured! It's no jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to the fire. 'I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,' I replied. 'You love Mr. Edgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and loves you. The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him without that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the four former attractions.' 'No, to be sure not: I should only pity him - hate him, perhaps, if he were ugly, and a clown.' 'But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world: handsomer, possibly, and richer than he is. What should hinder you from loving them?' 'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.' 'You may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may not always be rich.' 'He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak rationally.' 'Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry Mr. Linton.' 'I don't want your permission for that - I SHALL marry him: and yet you have not told me whether I'm right.' 'Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present. And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and easy: where is the obstacle?' 'HERE! and HERE!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead, and the other on her breast: 'in whichever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!' 'That's very strange! I cannot make it out.' 'It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I can't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.' She seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver, and her clasped hands trembled. 'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after some minutes' reflection. 'Yes, now and then,' I answered. 'And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me, like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is one: I'm going to tell it - but take care not to smile at any part of it.' 'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried. 'We're dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at little Hareton! HE'S dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!' 'Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude! You remember him, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing: nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.' 'I won't hear it, I won't hear it!' I repeated, hastily. I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. 'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.' 'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered. 'All sinners would be miserable in heaven.' 'But it is not for that. I dreamt once that I was there.' 'I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine! I'll go to bed,' I interrupted again. She laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair. 'This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did not seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the middle of the heath on the top of  ; where I woke sobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other. I've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and if the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he shall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.' Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence. Having noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the bench, and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he heard Catherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I started, and bade her hush! 'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round. 'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his cartwheels up the road; 'and Heathcliff will come in with him. I'm not sure whether he were not at the door this moment.' 'Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door!' said she. 'Give me Hareton, while you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you. I want to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that Heathcliff has no notion of these things. He has not, has he? He does not know what being in love is!' 'I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' I returned; 'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that ever was born! As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and love, and all! Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss Catherine - ' 'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of indignation. 'Who is to separate us, pray? They'll meet the fate of Milo! Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature. Every Linton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could consent to forsake Heathcliff. Oh, that's not what I intend - that's not what I mean! I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded! He'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime. Edgar must shake off his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least. He will, when he learns my true feelings towards him. Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish wretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother's power.' 'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked. 'You'll find him not so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I think that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of young Linton.' 'It is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best! The others were the satisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him. This is for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar and myself. I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and HE remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it. - My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I AM Heathcliff! He's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and - ' She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it forcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly! 'If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it only goes to convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in marrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl. But trouble me with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.' 'You'll keep that?' she asked, eagerly. 'No, I'll not promise,' I repeated. She was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our conversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed Hareton, while I made the supper. After it was cooked, my fellow-servant and I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we didn't settle it till all was nearly cold. Then we came to the agreement that we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly to go into his presence when he had been some time alone. 'And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time? What is he about? girt idle seeght!' demanded the old man, looking round for Heathcliff. 'I'll call him,' I replied. 'He's in the barn, I've no doubt.' I went and called, but got no answer. On returning, I whispered to Catherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and told how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her brother's conduct regarding him. She jumped up in a fine fright, flung Hareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not taking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would have affected him. She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we should wait no longer. He cunningly conjectured they were staying away in order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing. They were 'ill eneugh for ony fahl manners,' he affirmed. And on their behalf he added that night a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication before meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had not his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he must run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and make him re-enter directly! 'I want to speak to him, and I MUST, before I go upstairs,' she said. 'And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not reply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.' Joseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer contradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked grumbling forth. Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor, exclaiming - 'I wonder where he is - I wonder where he can be! What did I say, Nelly? I've forgotten. Was he vexed at my bad humour this afternoon? Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him? I do wish he'd come. I do wish he would!' 'What a noise for nothing!' I cried, though rather uneasy myself. 'What a trifle scares you! It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff should take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to speak to us in the hay-loft. I'll engage he's lurking there. See if I don't ferret him out!' I departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and Joseph's quest ended in the same. 'Yon lad gets war und war!' observed he on re-entering. 'He's left th' gate at t' full swing, and Miss's pony has trodden dahn two rigs o' corn, and plottered through, raight o'er into t' meadow! Hahsomdiver, t' maister 'ull play t' devil to-morn, and he'll do weel. He's patience itsseln wi' sich careless, offald craters - patience itsseln he is! Bud he'll not be soa allus - yah's see, all on ye! Yah mun'n't drive him out of his heead for nowt!' 'Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?' interrupted Catherine. 'Have you been looking for him, as I ordered?' 'I sud more likker look for th' horse,' he replied. 'It 'ud be to more sense. Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike this - as black as t' chimbley! und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at MY whistle - happen he'll be less hard o' hearing wi' YE!' It WAS a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However, Catherine would hot be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying. About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen-fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawl-less to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands before it. 'Well, Miss!' I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 'you are not bent on getting your death, are you? Do you know what o'clock it is? Half-past twelve. Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that foolish boy: he'll be gone to Gimmerton, and he'll stay there now. He guesses we shouldn't wait for him till this late hour: at least, he guesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd rather avoid having the door opened by the master.' 'Nay, nay, he's noan at Gimmerton,' said Joseph. 'I's niver wonder but he's at t' bothom of a bog-hoile. This visitation worn't for nowt, and I wod hev' ye to look out, Miss - yah muh be t' next. Thank Hivin for all! All warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro' th' rubbidge! Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.' And he began quoting several texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find them. I, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet things, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed with little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping round him. I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I distinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep. Coming down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing the chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the fireplace. The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed windows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard and drowsy. 'What ails you, Cathy?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal as a drowned whelp. Why are you so damp and pale, child?' 'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.' 'Oh, she is naughty!' I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably sober. 'She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there she has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir.' Mr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise. 'The night through,' he repeated. 'What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely? That was over hours since.' Neither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could conceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she took it into her head to sit up; and she said nothing. The morning was fresh and cool; I threw back the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from the garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the window. I'm starving!' And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to the almost extinguished embers. 'She's ill,' said Hindley, taking her wrist; 'I suppose that's the reason she would not go to bed. Damn it! I don't want to be troubled with more sickness here. What took you into the rain?' 'Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue. 'If I war yah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle and simple! Never a day ut yah're off, but yon cat o' Linton comes sneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo's a fine lass! shoo sits watching for ye i' t' kitchen; and as yah're in at one door, he's out at t'other; and, then, wer grand lady goes a- courting of her side! It's bonny behaviour, lurking amang t' fields, after twelve o' t' night, wi' that fahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff! They think I'M blind; but I'm noan: nowt ut t' soart! - I seed young Linton boath coming and going, and I seed YAH' (directing his discourse to me), 'yah gooid fur nowt, slattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t' maister's horse-fit clatter up t' road.' 'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before me! Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was I who told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as you were.' 'You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a confounded simpleton! But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were you not with Heathcliff last night? Speak the truth, now. You need not he afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a good turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of breaking his neck. To prevent it, I shall send him about his business this very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp: I shall only have the more humour for you.' 'I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob bitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him. But, perhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he's gone.' Here she burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were inarticulate. Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing! I obliged her to obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her chamber: it terrified me. I thought she was going mad, and I begged Joseph to run for the doctor. It proved the commencement of delirium: Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she had a fever. He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish, where two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and cottage. Though I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were no better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a patient could be, she weathered it through. Old Mrs. Linton paid us several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very grateful. But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other. Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier than ever. Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where indeed it belonged, as she well knew. From that period, for several months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the relation of a mere servant. Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration. Then the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. From Mr. Earnshaw and his companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper. He was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection, but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared! Edgar Linton, as multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death. Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave   and accompany her here, Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I had just begun to teach him his letters. We made a sad parting; but Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours. When I refused to go, and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to her husband and brother. The former offered me munificent wages; the latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said, now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take him in hand, by-and-by. And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was ordered. I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then he has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was ever more than all the world to her and she to him!  At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the minute-hand measure half-past one. She would not hear of staying a second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of her narrative myself. And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.  "
Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 3-Part 1 Chapter 4," The UM now uses an analogy to make his point.  He describes the normal, ""stupid"" person as an enraged bull rushing headlong into a wall at the slightest impulse.  He likens himself, one who possesses a hyperconsciousness, to a mouse-the antithesis of a normal man, he says.  While the bull acts on its rather simple mental reasoning, the mouse cannot act because its overly sophisticated mental processes perpetually plague it with doubt and vacillation, rendering him unable to do anything, save ""creep ignominiously back into its mousehole."" This hole, this underground, is the home of the UM and those like him. At the end of the chapter, the UM elaborates on the wall concept.  The wall represents, he explains, ""the laws of nature, the conclusions of natural science and mathematics."" The wall also embodies such ideas as evolution, which Dostoevsky largely equated with atheism and socialism.  While the man of action readily accepts the wall and its implications, the UM (and Dostoevsky) can't come to grips with the concept of the stone wall, the idea that ""two times two makes four,"" because it makes man out to be an animal-a mere phenomenon of science, lacking the human component of free will. To advance his previous point that one can find pleasure in suffering, the UM uses the example of a toothache.  He explains that though there is absolutely no rational motive for finding enjoyment in one's pain, realizing that one can make such an irrational decision is in and of itself a cause for certain satisfaction. ",Notes from the Underground,Part 1 Chapter 3-Part 1 Chapter 4,"  With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. (By the way: facing the wall, such gentlemen--that is, the ""direct"" persons and men of action--are genuinely nonplussed. For them a wall is not an evasion, as for us people who think and consequently do nothing; it is not an excuse for turning aside, an excuse for which we are always very glad, though we scarcely believe in it ourselves, as a rule. No, they are nonplussed in all sincerity. The wall has for them something tranquillising, morally soothing, final-- maybe even something mysterious ... but of the wall later.) Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man. It may be an acutely conscious mouse, yet it is a mouse, while the other is a man, and therefore, et caetera, et caetera. And the worst of it is, he himself, his very own self, looks on himself as a mouse; no one asks him to do so; and that is an important point. Now let us look at this mouse in action. Let us suppose, for instance, that it feels insulted, too (and it almost always does feel insulted), and wants to revenge itself, too. There may even be a greater accumulation of spite in it than in L'HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE. The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in L'HOMME DE LA NATURE ET DE LA VERITE. For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it. To come at last to the deed itself, to the very act of revenge. Apart from the one fundamental nastiness the luckless mouse succeeds in creating around it so many other nastinesses in the form of doubts and questions, adds to the one question so many unsettled questions that there inevitably works up around it a sort of fatal brew, a stinking mess, made up of its doubts, emotions, and of the contempt spat upon it by the direct men of action who stand solemnly about it as judges and arbitrators, laughing at it till their healthy sides ache. Of course the only thing left for it is to dismiss all that with a wave of its paw, and, with a smile of assumed contempt in which it does not even itself believe, creep ignominiously into its mouse-hole. There in its nasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will forgive nothing. Maybe it will begin to revenge itself, too, but, as it were, piecemeal, in trivial ways, from behind the stove, incognito, without believing either in its own right to vengeance, or in the success of its revenge, knowing that from all its efforts at revenge it will suffer a hundred times more than he on whom it revenges itself, while he, I daresay, will not even scratch himself. On its deathbed it will recall it all over again, with interest accumulated over all the years and ... But it is just in that cold, abominable half despair, half belief, in that conscious burying oneself alive for grief in the underworld for forty years, in that acutely recognised and yet partly doubtful hopelessness of one's position, in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later--that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of it. ""Possibly,"" you will add on your own account with a grin, ""people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face,"" and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you. I will continue calmly concerning persons with strong nerves who do not understand a certain refinement of enjoyment. Though in certain circumstances these gentlemen bellow their loudest like bulls, though this, let us suppose, does them the greatest credit, yet, as I have said already, confronted with the impossible they subside at once. The impossible means the stone wall! What stone wall? Why, of course, the laws of nature, the deductions of natural science, mathematics. As soon as they prove to you, for instance, that you are descended from a monkey, then it is no use scowling, accept it for a fact. When they prove to you that in reality one drop of your own fat must be dearer to you than a hundred thousand of your fellow-creatures, and that this conclusion is the final solution of all so-called virtues and duties and all such prejudices and fancies, then you have just to accept it, there is no help for it, for twice two is a law of mathematics. Just try refuting it. ""Upon my word, they will shout at you, it is no use protesting: it is a case of twice two makes four! Nature does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on."" Merciful Heavens! but what do I care for the laws of nature and arithmetic, when, for some reason I dislike those laws and the fact that twice two makes four? Of course I cannot break through the wall by battering my head against it if I really have not the strength to knock it down, but I am not going to be reconciled to it simply because it is a stone wall and I have not the strength. As though such a stone wall really were a consolation, and really did contain some word of conciliation, simply because it is as true as twice two makes four. Oh, absurdity of absurdities! How much better it is to understand it all, to recognise it all, all the impossibilities and the stone wall; not to be reconciled to one of those impossibilities and stone walls if it disgusts you to be reconciled to it; by the way of the most inevitable, logical combinations to reach the most revolting conclusions on the everlasting theme, that even for the stone wall you are yourself somehow to blame, though again it is as clear as day you are not to blame in the least, and therefore grinding your teeth in silent impotence to sink into luxurious inertia, brooding on the fact that there is no one even for you to feel vindictive against, that you have not, and perhaps never will have, an object for your spite, that it is a sleight of hand, a bit of juggling, a card- sharper's trick, that it is simply a mess, no knowing what and no knowing who, but in spite of all these uncertainties and jugglings, still there is an ache in you, and the more you do not know, the worse the ache.  "
A Tale of Two Cities: Novel Summary: Book II Chapter 4-5," Outside the court Charles Darnay, Lucie Manette, Doctor Manette and Mr. Lorry discuss the trial. After kissing Lucie's hand, Mr. Darnay thanks Mr. Stryver who has pushed his way into the group. Mr. Lorry sees Dr. Manette look somewhat fearfully and curiously at Charles Darnay. Soon the doctor and his daughter depart. Sydney Carton approaches the group. He is a little drunk and smells of port wine. Mr. Carton upsets Mr. Lorry by explaining that he, Mr. Carton, has no business and even that even if he did he would not attend to it. Mr. Lorry asserts that business is what guides one's life and departs in a huff. Sydney Carton takes Darnay to a nearby tavern to dine and drink. Carton proceeds to get more inebriated and chides Darnay for the obvious affection that Lucie Manette showed for him on the stand. His line of questioning leads to the assertion that he doesn't particularly care for Darnay. Before Darnay departs, Sydney Carton confides to him that he is a drunk because he cares for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for him. After Darnay leaves he orders another pint of port and gives orders to be awoken at 10pm. He questions himself in a mirror and tells himself that he hates Darnay because the remarkable similarity in their appearance reminds him of what he has not become. He falls asleep on his arm at the table. The narrator observes that those were drinking days in London and Mr. Stryver, who was tireless in his pursuit of professional success and advancement, was like his counterpart Sydney Carton a heavy drinker. Carton rendered service to Stryver in all night drinking sessions where he would review Carton's upcoming cases and distill the essence from the various statements, a task his friend was intellectually ill equipped to perform himself. In this way Sydney Carton was the jackal to Mr. Stryver's lion. After being awoken by the waiter at 10pm, Sydney Carton made his way to Stryver's apartment where the two engaged in a long night of drinking while Carton poured over case briefs. While Stryver reclined on the sofa and drank at ease, Carton draped himself in cool wet towels and doggedly drank alcoholic punch and did his work. At three in the morning, the work complete, the two friends discuss the differences in the their nature and recall the days they spent as students in Paris. Before Carton leaves, Stryver asks what he thought of the pretty Miss Manette and is surprised to hear his morose friend's assertion that she was not very pretty. Carton walks home alone through the cold streets and falls asleep in his rarely used bed. Analysis of  These chapters serve to flesh out the character of Sydney Carton. His discussion with Darnay demonstrates that although the two are alike in appearance their demeanors are very different. While Darnay eats, Carton drinks and whereas Darnay is polite and tempers his responses, Carton's comments are caustic, fueled by alcohol and a general dissatisfaction with life. The second half of Carton's evening, spent at Mr. Stryver's apartment, illustrates Carton's genius with the law and his complete willingness to let his partner take the credit for his own work. Though, as Mr. Stryver notes, In these descriptions, the reader is given the impression of a man who feels unloved, uninspired and for lack of any other attractive alternative, satisfied with simply doing his partner's work. Their discussion reveals that they have known each other since their school days and that Stryver has always been pushing his way to the front ranks. ""You were always somewhere,"" observes Carton, ""and I was always - nowhere."" They are opposites and together they seem to be prospering. Their partnership is depicted as a friendly union that neither man seems impelled to break. Sydney Carton's dismissal of Miss Manette's beauty, something, which has obviously affected him, reveals that he is not devoid of sensitivity and yearning for a higher purpose.",A Tale of Two Cities,Book II Chapter 4-5," Congratulatory  From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death. It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away. Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over. Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life. He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: ""I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account."" ""You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,"" said his late client, taking his hand. ""I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe."" It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, ""Much better,"" Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again. ""You think so?"" said Mr. Stryver. ""Well! you have been present all day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too."" ""And as such,"" quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--""as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out."" ""Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,"" said Stryver; ""I have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself."" ""I speak for myself,"" answered Mr. Lorry, ""and for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?"" He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. ""My father,"" said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. ""Shall we go home, my father?"" With a long breath, he answered ""Yes."" The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. ""So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?"" Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. ""If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay."" Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, ""You have mentioned that before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves."" ""_I_ know, _I_ know,"" rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. ""Don't be nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say."" ""And indeed, sir,"" pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, ""I really don't know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your business."" ""Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business,"" said Mr. Carton. ""It is a pity you have not, sir."" ""I think so, too."" ""If you had,"" pursued Mr. Lorry, ""perhaps you would attend to it."" ""Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't,"" said Mr. Carton. ""Well, sir!"" cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, ""business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!"" Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay: ""This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?"" ""I hardly seem yet,"" returned Charles Darnay, ""to belong to this world again."" ""I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly."" ""I begin to think I AM faint."" ""Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at."" Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him. ""Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?"" ""I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that."" ""It must be an immense satisfaction!"" He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one. ""As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I."" Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all. ""Now your dinner is done,"" Carton presently said, ""why don't you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?"" ""What health? What toast?"" ""Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll swear it's there."" ""Miss Manette, then!"" ""Miss Manette, then!"" Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another. ""That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!"" he said, ruing his new goblet. A slight frown and a laconic ""Yes,"" were the answer. ""That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?"" Again Darnay answered not a word. ""She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was."" The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. ""I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,"" was the careless rejoinder. ""It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question."" ""Willingly, and a small return for your good offices."" ""Do you think I particularly like you?"" ""Really, Mr. Carton,"" returned the other, oddly disconcerted, ""I have not asked myself the question."" ""But ask yourself the question now."" ""You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do."" ""_I_ don't think I do,"" said Carton. ""I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding."" ""Nevertheless,"" pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, ""there is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side."" Carton rejoining, ""Nothing in life!"" Darnay rang. ""Do you call the whole reckoning?"" said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, ""Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten."" The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, ""A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?"" ""I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton."" ""Think? You know I have been drinking."" ""Since I must say so, I know it."" ""Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me."" ""Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better."" ""May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you, however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!"" When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it. ""Do you particularly like the man?"" he muttered, at his own image; ""why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow."" He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.  V The Jackal  Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the drier parts of the legal race. A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions. It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning. Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity. ""Ten o'clock, sir,"" said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to wake him--""ten o'clock, sir."" ""WHAT'S the matter?"" ""Ten o'clock, sir."" ""What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?"" ""Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you."" ""Oh! I remember. Very well, very well."" After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple, and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers. The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age. ""You are a little late, Memory,"" said Stryver. ""About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."" They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons. ""You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."" ""Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or seeing him dine--it's all one!"" ""That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?"" ""I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck."" Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch. ""You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work."" Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down at the table, and said, ""Now I am ready!"" ""Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,"" said Mr. Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers. ""How much?"" ""Only two sets of them."" ""Give me the worst first."" ""There they are, Sydney. Fire away!"" The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity. At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution, made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his hands in his waistband again, and lay down to mediate. The jackal then invigorated himself with a bum for his throttle, and a fresh application to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning. ""And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,"" said Mr. Stryver. The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied. ""You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told."" ""I always am sound; am I not?"" ""I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to it and smooth it again."" With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied. ""The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,"" said Stryver, nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, ""the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!"" ""Ah!"" returned the other, sighing: ""yes! The same Sydney, with the same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own. ""And why not?"" ""God knows. It was my way, I suppose."" He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him, looking at the fire. ""Carton,"" said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air, as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, ""your way is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look at me."" ""Oh, botheration!"" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more good- humoured laugh, ""don't YOU be moral!"" ""How have I done what I have done?"" said Stryver; ""how do I do what I do?"" ""Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."" ""I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"" ""I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,"" said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed. ""Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,"" pursued Carton, ""you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always nowhere."" ""And whose fault was that?"" ""Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking. Turn me in some other direction before I go."" ""Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,"" said Stryver, holding up his glass. ""Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"" Apparently not, for he became gloomy again. ""Pretty witness,"" he muttered, looking down into his glass. ""I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"" ""The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."" ""SHE pretty?"" ""Is she not?"" ""No."" ""Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"" ""Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!"" ""Do you know, Sydney,"" said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: ""do you know, I rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"" ""Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink; I'll get to bed."" When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city. Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight. A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its pillow was wet with wasted tears. Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: An Awakening"," George often goes to see Belle Carpenter, a young milliner who lives with her father Henry, a bookkeeper in the local bank. Belle is in love with the bartender Ed Handby, even though they have only spent one evening in each other's company. Belle walks in the evenings with George as an outlet for her passion for the other man. She even allows George to kiss her. One night in January, George goes out for a walk and has an epiphany. He realizes that all people are connected through laws and a supreme order. He himself, he believes, must become more a part of that great connection. He finds himself moved by powerful words that he utters: ""death,. night, the sea, fear, loveliness"" (185). He goes to find Belle to tell her about his thoughts, but she just wants to make Ed jealous. When they go to a secluded spot to embrace, Ed shows up and tosses George aside. He does not want to beat George up; he just wants him out of the way. He does this three times, as George tries to charge the older man again and again. Then, Ed leaves with Belle and George is left with no more grand thoughts. Analysis George thinks that all men are connected by the ideas expressed by some brave words. But, the fact is, that there is no great order in which he is important. To Belle and Ed, he is just a nuisance. They are not bound together by great ideas. The other two people are in love, and George is meaningless to them. Because he is immature, George has not come to be obsessed by one idea or another, which means he is not yet a grotesque. But, as he flounders and tries to find a truth to attach himself to, he is absurd in his desire to grow up by adhering to one truth or another. This means there is not much hope for people, who either mature and become grotesques as their search for meaning hardens into belief in a set of ideas or are perpetually immature, like Enoch. ","Winesburg, Ohio",An Awakening," BELLE CARPENTER had a dark skin, grey eyes, and thick lips. She was tall and strong. When black thoughts visited her she grew angry and wished she were a man and could fight someone with her fists. She worked in the millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate McHugh and during the day sat trimming hats by a window at the rear of the store. She was the daugh- ter of Henry Carpenter, bookkeeper in the First Na- tional Bank of Winesburg, and lived with him in a gloomy old house far out at the end of Buckeye Street. The house was surrounded by pine trees and there was no grass beneath the trees. A rusty tin eaves-trough had slipped from its fastenings at the back of the house and when the wind blew it beat against the roof of a small shed, making a dismal drumming noise that sometimes persisted all through the night. When she was a young girl Henry Carpenter made life almost unbearable for Belle, but as she emerged from girlhood into womanhood he lost his power over her. The bookkeeper's life was made up of innumerable little pettinesses. When he went to the bank in the morning he stepped into a closet and put on a black alpaca coat that had become shabby with age. At night when he returned to his home he donned another black alpaca coat. Every evening he pressed the clothes worn in the streets. He had invented an arrangement of boards for the purpose. The trousers to his street suit were placed between the boards and the boards were clamped together with heavy screws. In the morning he wiped the boards with a damp cloth and stood them upright behind the dining room door. If they were moved during the day he was speechless with anger and did not recover his equilibrium for a week. The bank cashier was a little bully and was afraid of his daughter. She, he realized, knew the story of his brutal treatment of her mother and hated him for it. One day she went home at noon and carried a handful of soft mud, taken from the road, into the house. With the mud she smeared the face of the boards used for the pressing of trousers and then went back to her work feeling relieved and happy. Belle Carpenter occasionally walked out in the evening with George Willard. Secretly she loved an- other man, but her love affair, about which no one knew, caused her much anxiety. She was in love with Ed Handby, bartender in Ed Griffith's Saloon, and went about with the young reporter as a kind of relief to her feelings. She did not think that her station in life would permit her to be seen in the company of the bartender and walked about under the trees with George Willard and let him kiss her to relieve a longing that was very insistent in her nature. She felt that she could keep the younger man within bounds. About Ed Handby she was somewhat uncertain. Handby, the bartender, was a tall, broad-shouldered man of thirty who lived in a room upstairs above Griffith's saloon. His fists were large and his eyes unusually small, but his voice, as though striving to conceal the power back of his fists, was soft and quiet. At twenty-five the bartender had inherited a large farm from an uncle in Indiana. When sold, the farm brought in eight thousand dollars, which Ed spent in six months. Going to Sandusky, on Lake Erie, he began an orgy of dissipation, the story of which afterward filled his home town with awe. Here and there he went throwing the money about, driving carriages through the streets, giving wine parties to crowds of men and women, playing cards for high stakes and keeping mistresses whose wardrobes cost him hundreds of dollars. One night at a resort called Cedar Point, he got into a fight and ran amuck like a wild thing. With his fist he broke a large mirror in the wash room of a hotel and later went about smashing windows and breaking chairs in dance halls for the joy of hearing the glass rattle on the floor and seeing the terror in the eyes of clerks who had come from Sandusky to spend the evening at the resort with their sweethearts. The affair between Ed Handby and Belle Carpen- ter on the surface amounted to nothing. He had suc- ceeded in spending but one evening in her company. On that evening he hired a horse and buggy at Wes- ley Moyer's livery barn and took her for a drive. The conviction that she was the woman his nature demanded and that he must get her settled upon him and he told her of his desires. The bartender was ready to marry and to begin trying to earn money for the support of his wife, but so simple was his nature that he found it difficult to explain his intentions. His body ached with physical longing and with his body he expressed himself. Taking the milliner into his arms and holding her tightly in spite of her struggles, he kissed her until she became helpless. Then he brought her back to town and let her out of the buggy. ""When I get hold of you again I'll not let you go. You can't play with me,"" he de- clared as he turned to drive away. Then, jumping out of the buggy, he gripped her shoulders with his strong hands. ""I'll keep you for good the next time,"" he said. ""You might as well make up your mind to that. It's you and me for it and I'm going to have you before I get through."" One night in January when there was a new moon George Willard, who was in Ed Handby's mind the only obstacle to his getting Belle Carpenter, went for a walk. Early that evening George went into Ransom Surbeck's pool room with Seth Richmond and Art Wilson, son of the town butcher. Seth Richmond stood with his back against the wall and remained silent, but George Willard talked. The pool room was filled with Winesburg boys and they talked of women. The young reporter got into that vein. He said that women should look out for themselves, that the fellow who went out with a girl was not responsible for what happened. As he talked he looked about, eager for attention. He held the floor for five minutes and then Art Wilson began to talk. Art was learning the barber's trade in Cal Prouse's shop and already began to consider himself an au- thority in such matters as baseball, horse racing, drinking, and going about with women. He began to tell of a night when he with two men from Wines- burg went into a house of prostitution at the county seat. The butcher's son held a cigar in the side of his mouth and as he talked spat on the floor. ""The women in the place couldn't embarrass me although they tried hard enough,"" he boasted. ""One of the girls in the house tried to get fresh, but I fooled her. As soon as she began to talk I went and sat in her lap. Everyone in the room laughed when I kissed her. I taught her to let me alone."" George Willard went out of the pool room and into Main Street. For days the weather had been bitter cold with a high wind blowing down on the town from Lake Erie, eighteen miles to the north, but on that night the wind had died away and a new moon made the night unusually lovely. With- out thinking where he was going or what he wanted to do, George went out of Main Street and began walking in dimly lighted streets filled with frame houses. Out of doors under the black sky filled with stars he forgot his companions of the pool room. Because it was dark and he was alone he began to talk aloud. In a spirit of play he reeled along the street imitating a drunken man and then imagined himself a soldier clad in shining boots that reached to the knees and wearing a sword that jingled as he walked. As a soldier he pictured himself as an inspector, passing before a long line of men who stood at attention. He began to examine the accoutrements of the men. Before a tree he stopped and began to scold. ""Your pack is not in order,"" he said sharply. ""How many times will I have to speak of this matter? Everything must be in order here. We have a difficult task be- fore us and no difficult task can be done without order."" Hypnotized by his own words, the young man stumbled along the board sidewalk saying more words. ""There is a law for armies and for men too,"" he muttered, lost in reflection. ""The law begins with little things and spreads out until it covers every- thing. In every little thing there must be order, in the place where men work, in their clothes, in their thoughts. I myself must be orderly. I must learn that law. I must get myself into touch with something orderly and big that swings through the night like a star. In my little way I must begin to learn some- thing, to give and swing and work with life, with the law."" George Willard stopped by a picket fence near a street lamp and his body began to tremble. He had never before thought such thoughts as had just come into his head and he wondered where they had come from. For the moment it seemed to him that some voice outside of himself had been talking as he walked. He was amazed and delighted with his own mind and when he walked on again spoke of the matter with fervor. ""To come out of Ransom Surbeck's pool room and think things like that,"" he whispered. ""It is better to be alone. If I talked like Art Wilson the boys would understand me but they wouldn't understand what I've been thinking down here."" In Winesburg, as in all Ohio towns of twenty years ago, there was a section in which lived day laborers. As the time of factories had not yet come, the laborers worked in the fields or were section hands on the railroads. They worked twelve hours a day and received one dollar for the long day of toil. The houses in which they lived were small cheaply constructed wooden affairs with a garden at the back. The more comfortable among them kept cows and perhaps a pig, housed in a little shed at the rear of the garden. With his head filled with resounding thoughts, George Willard walked into such a street on the clear January night. The street was dimly lighted and in places there was no sidewalk. In the scene that lay about him there was something that excited his al- ready aroused fancy. For a year he had been devot- ing all of his odd moments to the reading of books and now some tale he had read concerning fife in old world towns of the middle ages came sharply back to his mind so that he stumbled forward with the curious feeling of one revisiting a place that had been a part of some former existence. On an impulse he turned out of the street and went into a little dark alleyway behind the sheds in which lived the cows and pigs. For a half hour he stayed in the alleyway, smelling the strong smell of animals too closely housed and letting his mind play with the strange new thoughts that came to him. The very rankness of the smell of manure in the clear sweet air awoke something heady in his brain. The poor little houses lighted by kerosene lamps, the smoke from the chimneys mounting straight up into the clear air, the grunting of pigs, the women clad in cheap calico dresses and washing dishes in the kitchens, the footsteps of men coming out of the houses and going off to the stores and saloons of Main Street, the dogs barking and the children crying--all of these things made him seem, as he lurked in the darkness, oddly detached and apart from all life. The excited young man, unable to bear the weight of his own thoughts, began to move cautiously along the alleyway. A dog attacked him and had to be driven away with stones, and a man appeared at the door of one of the houses and swore at the dog. George went into a vacant lot and throwing back his head looked up at the sky. He felt unutterably big and remade by the simple experience through which he had been passing and in a kind of fervor of emo- tion put up his hands, thrusting them into the dark- ness above his head and muttering words. The desire to say words overcame him and he said words without meaning, rolling them over on his tongue and saying them because they were brave words, full of meaning. ""Death,"" he muttered, night, the sea, fear, loveliness."" George Willard came out of the vacant lot and stood again on the sidewalk facing the houses. He felt that all of the people in the little street must be brothers and sisters to him and he wished he had the courage to call them out of their houses and to shake their hands. ""If there were only a woman here I would take hold of her hand and we would run until we were both tired out,"" he thought. ""That would make me feel better."" With the thought of a woman in his mind he walked out of the street and went toward the house where Belle Carpenter lived. He thought she would understand his mood and that he could achieve in her presence a position he had long been wanting to achieve. In the past when he had been with her and had kissed her lips he had come away filled with anger at himself. He had felt like one being used for some obscure purpose and had not enjoyed the feeling. Now he thought he had suddenly become too big to be used. When George got to Belle Carpenter's house there had already been a visitor there before him. Ed Handby had come to the door and calling Belle out of the house had tried to talk to her. He had wanted to ask the woman to come away with him and to be his wife, but when she came and stood by the door he lost his self-assurance and became sullen. ""You stay away from that kid,"" he growled, thinking of George Willard, and then, not knowing what else to say, turned to go away. ""If I catch you together I will break your bones and his too,"" he added. The bartender had come to woo, not to threaten, and was angry with himself because of his failure. When her lover had departed Belle went indoors and ran hurriedly upstairs. From a window at the upper part of the house she saw Ed Handby cross the street and sit down on a horse block before the house of a neighbor. In the dim light the man sat motionless holding his head in his hands. She was made happy by the sight, and when George Willard came to the door she greeted him effusively and hurriedly put on her hat. She thought that, as she walked through the streets with young Willard, Ed Handby would follow and she wanted to make him suffer. For an hour Belle Carpenter and the young re- porter walked about under the trees in the sweet night air. George Willard was full of big words. The sense of power that had come to him during the hour in the darkness in the alleyway remained with him and he talked boldly, swaggering along and swinging his arms about. He wanted to make Belle Carpenter realize that he was aware of his former weakness and that he had changed. ""You'll find me different,"" he declared, thrusting his hands into his pockets and looking boldly into her eyes. ""I don't know why but it is so. You've got to take me for a man or let me alone. That's how it is."" Up and down the quiet streets under the new moon went the woman and the boy. When George had finished talking they turned down a side street and went across a bridge into a path that ran up the side of a hill. The hill began at Waterworks Pond and climbed upward to the Winesburg Fair Grounds. On the hillside grew dense bushes and small trees and among the bushes were little open spaces carpeted with long grass, now stiff and frozen. As he walked behind the woman up the hill George Willard's heart began to beat rapidly and his shoulders straightened. Suddenly he decided that Belle Carpenter was about to surrender herself to him. The new force that had manifested itself in him had, he felt, been at work upon her and had led to her conquest. The thought made him half drunk with the sense of masculine power. Although he had been annoyed that as they walked about she had not seemed to be listening to his words, the fact that she had accompanied him to this place took all his doubts away. ""It is different. Everything has become different,"" he thought and taking hold of her shoulder turned her about and stood looking at her, his eyes shining with pride. Belle Carpenter did not resist. When he kissed her upon the lips she leaned heavily against him and looked over his shoulder into the darkness. In her whole attitude there was a suggestion of waiting. Again, as in the alleyway, George Willard's mind ran off into words and, holding the woman tightly he whispered the words into the still night. ""Lust,"" he whispered, ""lust and night and women."" George Willard did not understand what hap- pened to him that night on the hillside. Later, when he got to his own room, he wanted to weep and then grew half insane with anger and hate. He hated Belle Carpenter and was sure that all his life he would continue to hate her. On the hillside he had led the woman to one of the little open spaces among the bushes and had dropped to his knees beside her. As in the vacant lot, by the laborers' houses, he had put up his hands in gratitude for the new power in himself and was waiting for the woman to speak when Ed Handby appeared. The bartender did not want to beat the boy, who he thought had tried to take his woman away. He knew that beating was unnecessary, that he had power within himself to accomplish his purpose without using his fists. Gripping George by the shoulder and pulling him to his feet, he held him with one hand while he looked at Belle Carpenter seated on the grass. Then with a quick wide move- ment of his arm he sent the younger man sprawling away into the bushes and began to bully the woman, who had risen to her feet. ""You're no good,"" he said roughly. ""I've half a mind not to bother with you. I'd let you alone if I didn't want you so much."" On his hands and knees in the bushes George Willard stared at the scene before him and tried hard to think. He prepared to spring at the man who had humiliated him. To be beaten seemed to be infinitely better than to be thus hurled ignominiously aside. Three times the young reporter sprang at Ed Handby and each time the bartender, catching him by the shoulder, hurled him back into the bushes. The older man seemed prepared to keep the exercise going indefinitely but George Willard's head struck the root of a tree and he lay still. Then Ed Handby took Belle Carpenter by the arm and marched her away. George heard the man and woman making their way through the bushes. As he crept down the hill- side his heart was sick within him. He hated himself and he hated the fate that had brought about his humiliation. When his mind went back to the hour alone in the alleyway he was puzzled and stopping in the darkness listened, hoping to hear again the voice outside himself that had so short a time before put new courage into his heart. When his way homeward led him again into the street of frame houses he could not bear the sight and began to run, wanting to get quickly out of the neighborhood that now seemed to him utterly squalid and commonplace. ""QUEER"" FROM HIS SEAT on a box in the rough board shed that stuck like a burr on the rear of Cowley & Son's store in Winesburg, Elmer Cowley, the junior member of the firm, could see through a dirty window into the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle. Elmer was putting new shoelaces in his shoes. They did not go in readily and he had to take the shoes off. With the shoes in his hand he sat looking at a large hole in the heel of one of his stockings. Then looking quickly up he saw George Willard, the only newspa- per reporter in Winesburg, standing at the back door of the Eagle printshop and staring absentmindedly about. ""Well, well, what next!"" exclaimed the young man with the shoes in his hand, jumping to his feet and creeping away from the window. A flush crept into Elmer Cowley's face and his hands began to tremble. In Cowley & Son's store a Jewish traveling salesman stood by the counter talk- ing to his father. He imagined the reporter could hear what was being said and the thought made him furious. With one of the shoes still held in his hand he stood in a corner of the shed and stamped with a stockinged foot upon the board floor. Cowley & Son's store did not face the main street of Winesburg. The front was on Maumee Street and beyond it was Voight's wagon shop and a shed for the sheltering of farmers' horses. Beside the store an alleyway ran behind the main street stores and all day drays and delivery wagons, intent on bringing in and taking out goods, passed up and down. The store itself was indescribable. Will Henderson once said of it that it sold everything and nothing. In the window facing Maumee Street stood a chunk of coal as large as an apple barrel, to indicate that orders for coal were taken, and beside the black mass of the coal stood three combs of honey grown brown and dirty in their wooden frames. The honey had stood in the store window for six months. It was for sale as were also the coat hang- ers, patent suspender buttons, cans of roof paint, bottles of rheumatism cure, and a substitute for cof- fee that companioned the honey in its patient will- ingness to serve the public. Ebenezer Cowley, the man who stood in the store listening to the eager patter of words that fell from the lips of the traveling man, was tall and lean and looked unwashed. On his scrawny neck was a large wen partially covered by a grey beard. He wore a long Prince Albert coat. The coat had been pur- chased to serve as a wedding garment. Before he became a merchant Ebenezer was a farmer and after his marriage he wore the Prince Albert coat to church on Sundays and on Saturday afternoons when he came into town to trade. When he sold the farm to become a merchant he wore the coat constantly. It had become brown with age and was covered with grease spots, but in it Ebenezer always felt dressed up and ready for the day in town. As a merchant Ebenezer was not happily placed in life and he had not been happily placed as a farmer. Still he existed. His family, consisting of a daughter named Mabel and the son, lived with him in rooms above the store and it did not cost them much to live. His troubles were not financial. His unhappiness as a merchant lay in the fact that when a traveling man with wares to be sold came in at the front door he was afraid. Behind the counter he stood shaking his head. He was afraid, first that he would stubbornly refuse to buy and thus lose the opportunity to sell again; second that he would not be stubborn enough and would in a moment of weakness buy what could not be sold. In the store on the morning when Elmer Cowley saw George Willard standing and apparently lis- tening at the back door of the Eagle printshop, a situation had arisen that always stirred the son's wrath. The traveling man talked and Ebenezer lis- tened, his whole figure expressing uncertainty. ""You see how quickly it is done,"" said the traveling man, who had for sale a small flat metal substitute for collar buttons. With one hand he quickly unfastened a collar from his shirt and then fastened it on again. He assumed a flattering wheedling tone. ""I tell you what, men have come to the end of all this fooling with collar buttons and you are the man to make money out of the change that is coming. I am offer- ing you the exclusive agency for this town. Take twenty dozen of these fasteners and I'll not visit any other store. I'll leave the field to you."" The traveling man leaned over the counter and tapped with his finger on Ebenezer's breast. ""It's an opportunity and I want you to take it,"" he urged. ""A friend of mine told me about you. 'See that man Cowley,' he said. 'He's a live one.'"" The traveling man paused and waited. Taking a book from his pocket he began writing out the order. Still holding the shoe in his hand Elmer Cow- ley went through the store, past the two absorbed men, to a glass showcase near the front door. He took a cheap revolver from the case and began to wave it about. ""You get out of here!"" he shrieked. ""We don't want any collar fasteners here."" An idea came to him. ""Mind, I'm not making any threat,"" he added. ""I don't say I'll shoot. Maybe I just took this gun out of the case to look at it. But you better get out. Yes sir, I'll say that. You better grab up your things and get out."" The young storekeeper's voice rose to a scream and going behind the counter he began to advance upon the two men. ""We're through being fools here!"" he cried. ""We ain't going to buy any more stuff until we begin to sell. We ain't going to keep on being queer and have folks staring and listening. You get out of here!"" The traveling man left. Raking the samples of col- lar fasteners off the counter into a black leather bag, he ran. He was a small man and very bow-legged and he ran awkwardly. The black bag caught against the door and he stumbled and fell. ""Crazy, that's what he is--crazy!"" he sputtered as he arose from the sidewalk and hurried away. In the store Elmer Cowley and his father stared at each other. Now that the immediate object of his wrath had fled, the younger man was embarrassed. ""Well, I meant it. I think we've been queer long enough,"" he declared, going to the showcase and replacing the revolver. Sitting on a barrel he pulled on and fastened the shoe he had been holding in his hand. He was waiting for some word of under- standing from his father but when Ebenezer spoke his words only served to reawaken the wrath in the son and the young man ran out of the store without replying. Scratching his grey beard with his long dirty fingers, the merchant looked at his son with the same wavering uncertain stare with which he had confronted the traveling man. ""I'll be starched,"" he said softly. ""Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed and starched!"" Elmer Cowley went out of Winesburg and along a country road that paralleled the railroad track. He did not know where he was going or what he was going to do. In the shelter of a deep cut where the road, after turning sharply to the right, dipped under the tracks he stopped and the passion that had been the cause of his outburst in the store began to again find expression. ""I will not be queer--one to be looked at and listened to,"" he declared aloud. ""I'll be like other people. I'll show that George Wil- lard. He'll find out. I'll show him!"" The distraught young man stood in the middle of the road and glared back at the town. He did not know the reporter George Willard and had no spe- cial feeling concerning the tall boy who ran about town gathering the town news. The reporter had merely come, by his presence in the office and in the printshop of the Winesburg Eagle, to stand for something in the young merchant's mind. He thought the boy who passed and repassed Cowley & Son's store and who stopped to talk to people in the street must be thinking of him and perhaps laughing at him. George Willard, he felt, belonged to the town, typified the town, represented in his person the spirit of the town. Elmer Cowley could not have believed that George Willard had also his days of unhappiness, that vague hungers and secret unnam- able desires visited also his mind. Did he not repre- sent public opinion and had not the public opinion of Winesburg condemned the Cowleys to queerness? Did he not walk whistling and laughing through Main Street? Might not one by striking his person strike also the greater enemy--the thing that smiled and went its own way--the judgment of Winesburg? Elmer Cowley was extraordinarily tall and his arms were long and powerful. His hair, his eye- brows, and the downy beard that had begun to grow upon his chin, were pale almost to whiteness. His teeth protruded from between his lips and his eyes were blue with the colorless blueness of the marbles called ""aggies"" that the boys of Winesburg carried in their pockets. Elmer had lived in Wines- burg for a year and had made no friends. He was, he felt, one condemned to go through life without friends and he hated the thought. Sullenly the tall young man tramped along the road with his hands stuffed into his trouser pockets. The day was cold with a raw wind, but presently the sun began to shine and the road became soft and muddy. The tops of the ridges of frozen mud that formed the road began to melt and the mud clung to Elmer's shoes. His feet became cold. When he had gone several miles he turned off the road, crossed a field and entered a wood. In the wood he gathered sticks to build a fire, by which he sat trying to warm himself, miserable in body and in mind. For two hours he sat on the log by the fire and then, arising and creeping cautiously through a mass of underbrush, he went to a fence and looked across fields to a small farmhouse surrounded by low sheds. A smile came to his lips and he began making motions with his long arms to a man who was husking corn in one of the fields. In his hour of misery the young merchant had returned to the farm where he had lived through boyhood and where there was another human being to whom he felt he could explain himself. The man on the farm was a half-witted old fellow named Mook. He had once been employed by Ebenezer Cowley and had stayed on the farm when it was sold. The old man lived in one of the unpainted sheds back of the farmhouse and puttered about all day in the fields. Mook the half-wit lived happily. With childlike faith he believed in the intelligence of the animals that lived in the sheds with him, and when he was lonely held long conversations with the cows, the pigs, and even with the chickens that ran about the barnyard. He it was who had put the expression regarding being ""laundered"" into the mouth of his former employer. When excited or surprised by any- thing he smiled vaguely and muttered: ""I'll be washed and ironed. Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed and starched."" When the half-witted old man left his husking of corn and came into the wood to meet Elmer Cowley, he was neither surprised nor especially interested in the sudden appearance of the young man. His feet also were cold and he sat on the log by the fire, grateful for the warmth and apparently indifferent to what Elmer had to say. Elmer talked earnestly and with great freedom, walking up and down and waving his arms about. ""You don't understand what's the matter with me so of course you don't care,"" he declared. ""With me it's different. Look how it has always been with me. Father is queer and mother was queer, too. Even the clothes mother used to wear were not like other people's clothes, and look at that coat in which fa- ther goes about there in town, thinking he's dressed up, too. Why don't he get a new one? It wouldn't cost much. I'll tell you why. Father doesn't know and when mother was alive she didn't know either. Mabel is different. She knows but she won't say anything. I will, though. I'm not going to be stared at any longer. Why look here, Mook, father doesn't know that his store there in town is just a queer jumble, that he'll never sell the stuff he buys. He knows nothing about it. Sometimes he's a little wor- ried that trade doesn't come and then he goes and buys something else. In the evenings he sits by the fire upstairs and says trade will come after a while. He isn't worried. He's queer. He doesn't know enough to be worried."" The excited young man became more excited. ""He don't know but I know,"" he shouted, stopping to gaze down into the dumb, unresponsive face of the half-wit. ""I know too well. I can't stand it. When we lived out here it was different. I worked and at night I went to bed and slept. I wasn't always seeing people and thinking as I am now. In the evening, there in town, I go to the post office or to the depot to see the train come in, and no one says anything to me. Everyone stands around and laughs and they talk but they say nothing to me. Then I feel so queer that I can't talk either. I go away. I don't say any- thing. I can't."" The fury of the young man became uncontrollable. ""I won't stand it,"" he yelled, looking up at the bare branches of the trees. ""I'm not made to stand it."" Maddened by the dull face of the man on the log by the fire, Elmer turned and glared at him as he had glared back along the road at the town of Winesburg. ""Go on back to work,"" he screamed. ""What good does it do me to talk to you?"" A thought came to him and his voice dropped. ""I'm a coward too, eh?"" he muttered. ""Do you know why I came clear out here afoot? I had to tell someone and you were the only one I could tell. I hunted out another queer one, you see. I ran away, that's what I did. I couldn't stand up to someone like that George Willard. I had to come to you. I ought to tell him and I will."" Again his voice arose to a shout and his arms flew about. ""I will tell him. I won't be queer. I don't care what they think. I won't stand it."" Elmer Cowley ran out of the woods leaving the half-wit sitting on the log before the fire. Presently the old man arose and climbing over the fence went back to his work in the corn. ""I'll be washed and ironed and starched,"" he declared. ""Well, well, I'll be washed and ironed."" Mook was interested. He went along a lane to a field where two cows stood nibbling at a straw stack. ""Elmer was here,"" he said to the cows. ""Elmer is crazy. You better get behind the stack where he don't see you. He'll hurt some- one yet, Elmer will."" At eight o'clock that evening Elmer Cowley put his head in at the front door of the office of the Winesburg Eagle where George Willard sat writing. His cap was pulled down over his eyes and a sullen determined look was on his face. ""You come on out- side with me,"" he said, stepping in and closing the door. He kept his hand on the knob as though pre- pared to resist anyone else coming in. ""You just come along outside. I want to see you."" George Willard and Elmer Cowley walked through the main street of Winesburg. The night was cold and George Willard had on a new overcoat and looked very spruce and dressed up. He thrust his hands into the overcoat pockets and looked inquir- ingly at his companion. He had long been wanting to make friends with the young merchant and find out what was in his mind. Now he thought he saw a chance and was delighted. ""I wonder what he's up to? Perhaps he thinks he has a piece of news for the paper. It can't be a fire because I haven't heard the fire bell and there isn't anyone running,"" he thought. In the main street of Winesburg, on the cold No- vember evening, but few citizens appeared and these hurried along bent on getting to the stove at the back of some store. The windows of the stores were frosted and the wind rattled the tin sign that hung over the entrance to the stairway leading to Doctor Welling's office. Before Hern's Grocery a bas- ket of apples and a rack filled with new brooms stood on the sidewalk. Elmer Cowley stopped and stood facing George Willard. He tried to talk and his arms began to pump up and down. His face worked spasmodically. He seemed about to shout. ""Oh, you go on back,"" he cried. ""Don't stay out here with me. I ain't got anything to tell you. I don't want to see you at all."" For three hours the distracted young merchant wandered through the resident streets of Winesburg blind with anger, brought on by his failure to declare his determination not to be queer. Bitterly the sense of defeat settled upon him and he wanted to weep. After the hours of futile sputtering at nothingness that had occupied the afternoon and his failure in the presence of the young reporter, he thought he could see no hope of a future for himself. And then a new idea dawned for him. In the dark- ness that surrounded him he began to see a light. Going to the now darkened store, where Cowley & Son had for over a year waited vainly for trade to come, he crept stealthily in and felt about in a barrel that stood by the stove at the rear. In the barrel beneath shavings lay a tin box containing Cowley & Son's cash. Every evening Ebenezer Cowley put the box in the barrel when he closed the store and went upstairs to bed. ""They wouldn't never think of a careless place like that,"" he told himself, thinking of robbers. Elmer took twenty dollars, two ten-dollar bills, from the little roll containing perhaps four hundred dollars, the cash left from the sale of the farm. Then replacing the box beneath the shavings he went qui- etly out at the front door and walked again in the streets. The idea that he thought might put an end to all of his unhappiness was very simple. ""I will get out of here, run away from home,"" he told himself. He knew that a local freight train passed through Winesburg at midnight and went on to Cleveland, where it arrived at dawn. He would steal a ride on the local and when he got to Cleveland would lose himself in the crowds there. He would get work in some shop and become friends with the other workmen and would be indistinguishable. Then he could talk and laugh. He would no longer be queer and would make friends. Life would begin to have warmth and meaning for him as it had for others. The tall awkward young man, striding through the streets, laughed at himself because he had been angry and had been half afraid of George Willard. He decided he would have his talk with the young reporter before he left town, that he would tell him about things, perhaps challenge him, challenge all of Winesburg through him. Aglow with new confidence Elmer went to the office of the New Willard House and pounded on the door. A sleep-eyed boy slept on a cot in the office. He received no salary but was fed at the hotel table and bore with pride the title of ""night clerk."" Before the boy Elmer was bold, insistent. ""You 'wake him up,"" he commanded. ""You tell him to come down by the depot. I got to see him and I'm going away on the local. Tell him to dress and come on down. I ain't got much time."" The midnight local had finished its work in Wines- burg and the trainsmen were coupling cars, swing- ing lanterns and preparing to resume their flight east. George Willard, rubbing his eyes and again wearing the new overcoat, ran down to the station platform afire with curiosity. ""Well, here I am. What do you want? You've got something to tell me, eh?"" he said. Elmer tried to explain. He wet his lips with his tongue and looked at the train that had begun to groan and get under way. ""Well, you see,"" he began, and then lost control of his tongue. ""I'll be washed and ironed. I'll be washed and ironed and starched,"" he muttered half incoherently. Elmer Cowley danced with fury beside the groan- ing train in the darkness on the station platform. Lights leaped into the air and bobbed up and down before his eyes. Taking the two ten-dollar bills from his pocket he thrust them into George Willard's hand. ""Take them,"" he cried. ""I don't want them. Give them to father. I stole them."" With a snarl of rage he turned and his long arms began to flay the air. Like one struggling for release from hands that held him he struck out, hitting George Willard blow after blow on the breast, the neck, the mouth. The young reporter rolled over on the platform half un- conscious, stunned by the terrific force of the blows. Springing aboard the passing train and running over the tops of cars, Elmer sprang down to a flat car and lying on his face looked back, trying to see the fallen man in the darkness. Pride surged up in him. ""I showed him,"" he cried. ""I guess I showed him. I ain't so queer. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer."" THE UNTOLD LIE RAY PEARSON and Hal Winters were farm hands em- ployed on a farm three miles north of Winesburg. On Saturday afternoons they came into town and wandered about through the streets with other fel- lows from the country. Ray was a quiet, rather nervous man of perhaps fifty with a brown beard and shoulders rounded by too much and too hard labor. In his nature he was as unlike Hal Winters as two men can be unlike. Ray was an altogether serious man and had a little sharp-featured wife who had also a sharp voice. The two, with half a dozen thin-legged children, lived in a tumble-down frame house beside a creek at the back end of the Wills farm where Ray was employed. Hal Winters, his fellow employee, was a young fellow. He was not of the Ned Winters family, who were very respectable people in Winesburg, but was one of the three sons of the old man called Wind- peter Winters who had a sawmill near Unionville, six miles away, and who was looked upon by every- one in Winesburg as a confirmed old reprobate. People from the part of Northern Ohio in which Winesburg lies will remember old Windpeter by his unusual and tragic death. He got drunk one evening in town and started to drive home to Unionville along the railroad tracks. Henry Brattenburg, the butcher, who lived out that way, stopped him at the edge of the town and told him he was sure to meet the down train but Windpeter slashed at him with his whip and drove on. When the train struck and killed him and his two horses a farmer and his wife who were driving home along a nearby road saw the accident. They said that old Windpeter stood up on the seat of his wagon, raving and swearing at the onrushing locomotive, and that he fairly screamed with delight when the team, maddened by his inces- sant slashing at them, rushed straight ahead to cer- tain death. Boys like young George Willard and Seth Richmond will remember the incident quite vividly because, although everyone in our town said that the old man would go straight to hell and that the community was better off without him, they had a secret conviction that he knew what he was doing and admired his foolish courage. Most boys have seasons of wishing they could die gloriously instead of just being grocery clerks and going on with their humdrum lives. But this is not the story of Windpeter Winters nor yet of his son Hal who worked on the Wills farm with Ray Pearson. It is Ray's story. It will, however, be necessary to talk a little of young Hal so that you will get into the spirit of it. Hal was a bad one. Everyone said that. There were three of the Winters boys in that family, John, Hal, and Edward, all broad-shouldered big fellows like old Windpeter himself and all fighters and woman-chasers and generally all-around bad ones. Hal was the worst of the lot and always up to some devilment. He once stole a load of boards from his father's mill and sold them in Winesburg. With the money he bought himself a suit of cheap, flashy clothes. Then he got drunk and when his father came raving into town to find him, they met and fought with their fists on Main Street and were ar- rested and put into jail together. Hal went to work on the Wills farm because there was a country school teacher out that way who had taken his fancy. He was only twenty-two then but had already been in two or three of what were spo- ken of in Winesburg as ""women scrapes."" Everyone who heard of his infatuation for the school teacher was sure it would turn out badly. ""He'll only get her into trouble, you'll see,"" was the word that went around. And so these two men, Ray and Hal, were at work in a field on a day in the late October. They were husking corn and occasionally something was said and they laughed. Then came silence. Ray, who was the more sensitive and always minded things more, had chapped hands and they hurt. He put them into his coat pockets and looked away across the fields. He was in a sad, distracted mood and was affected by the beauty of the country. If you knew the Winesburg country in the fall and how the low hills are all splashed with yellows and reds you would understand his feeling. He began to think of the time, long ago when he was a young fellow living with his father, then a baker in Winesburg, and how on such days he had wandered away into the woods to gather nuts, hunt rabbits, or just to loaf about and smoke his pipe. His marriage had come about through one of his days of wandering. He had in- duced a girl who waited on trade in his father's shop to go with him and something had happened. He was thinking of that afternoon and how it had af- fected his whole life when a spirit of protest awoke in him. He had forgotten about Hal and muttered words. ""Tricked by Gad, that's what I was, tricked by life and made a fool of,"" he said in a low voice. As though understanding his thoughts, Hal Win- ters spoke up. ""Well, has it been worth while? What about it, eh? What about marriage and all that?"" he asked and then laughed. Hal tried to keep on laugh- ing but he too was in an earnest mood. He began to talk earnestly. ""Has a fellow got to do it?"" he asked. ""Has he got to be harnessed up and driven through life like a horse?"" Hal didn't wait for an answer but sprang to his feet and began to walk back and forth between the corn shocks. He was getting more and more excited. Bending down suddenly he picked up an ear of the yellow corn and threw it at the fence. ""I've got Nell Gunther in trouble,"" he said. ""I'm telling you, but you keep your mouth shut."" Ray Pearson arose and stood staring. He was al- most a foot shorter than Hal, and when the younger man came and put his two hands on the older man's shoulders they made a picture. There they stood in the big empty field with the quiet corn shocks stand- ing in rows behind them and the red and yellow hills in the distance, and from being just two indif- ferent workmen they had become all alive to each other. Hal sensed it and because that was his way he laughed. ""Well, old daddy,"" he said awkwardly, ""come on, advise me. I've got Nell in trouble. Per- haps you've been in the same fix yourself. I know what everyone would say is the right thing to do, but what do you say? Shall I marry and settle down? Shall I put myself into the harness to be worn out like an old horse? You know me, Ray. There can't anyone break me but I can break myself. Shall I do it or shall I tell Nell to go to the devil? Come on, you tell me. Whatever you say, Ray, I'll do."" Ray couldn't answer. He shook Hal's hands loose and turning walked straight away toward the barn. He was a sensitive man and there were tears in his eyes. He knew there was only one thing to say to Hal Winters, son of old Windpeter Winters, only one thing that all his own training and all the beliefs of the people he knew would approve, but for his life he couldn't say what he knew he should say. At half-past four that afternoon Ray was puttering about the barnyard when his wife came up the lane along the creek and called him. After the talk with Hal he hadn't returned to the cornfield but worked about the barn. He had already done the evening chores and had seen Hal, dressed and ready for a roistering night in town, come out of the farmhouse and go into the road. Along the path to his own house he trudged behind his wife, looking at the ground and thinking. He couldn't make out what was wrong. Every time he raised his eyes and saw the beauty of the country in the failing light he wanted to do something he had never done before, shout or scream or hit his wife with his fists or something equally unexpected and terrifying. Along the path he went scratching his head and trying to make it out. He looked hard at his wife's back but she seemed all right. She only wanted him to go into town for groceries and as soon as she had told him what she wanted began to scold. ""You're always puttering,"" she said. ""Now I want you to hustle. There isn't anything in the house for supper and you've got to get to town and back in a hurry."" Ray went into his own house and took an overcoat from a hook back of the door. It was torn about the pockets and the collar was shiny. His wife went into the bedroom and presently came out with a soiled cloth in one hand and three silver dollars in the other. Somewhere in the house a child wept bitterly and a dog that had been sleeping by the stove arose and yawned. Again the wife scolded. ""The children will cry and cry. Why are you always puttering?"" she asked. Ray went out of the house and climbed the fence into a field. It was just growing dark and the scene that lay before him was lovely. All the low hills were washed with color and even the little clusters of bushes in the corners of the fences were alive with beauty. The whole world seemed to Ray Pearson to have become alive with something just as he and Hal had suddenly become alive when they stood in the corn field stating into each other's eyes. The beauty of the country about Winesburg was too much for Ray on that fall evening. That is all there was to it. He could not stand it. Of a sudden he forgot all about being a quiet old farm hand and throwing off the torn overcoat began to run across the field. As he ran he shouted a protest against his life, against all life, against everything that makes life ugly. ""There was no promise made,"" he cried into the empty spaces that lay about him. ""I didn't promise my Minnie anything and Hal hasn't made any promise to Nell. I know he hasn't. She went into the woods with him because she wanted to go. What he wanted she wanted. Why should I pay? Why should Hal pay? Why should anyone pay? I don't want Hal to become old and worn out. I'll tell him. I won't let it go on. I'll catch Hal before he gets to town and I'll tell him."" Ray ran clumsily and once he stumbled and fell down. ""I must catch Hal and tell him,"" he kept thinking, and although his breath came in gasps he kept running harder and harder. As he ran he thought of things that hadn't come into his mind for years--how at the time he married he had planned to go west to his uncle in Portland, Oregon--how he hadn't wanted to be a farm hand, but had thought when he got out West he would go to sea and be a sailor or get a job on a ranch and ride a horse into Western towns, shouting and laughing and waking the people in the houses with his wild cries. Then as he ran he remembered his children and in fancy felt their hands clutching at him. All of his thoughts of himself were involved with the thoughts of Hal and he thought the children were clutching at the younger man also. ""They are the accidents of life, Hal,"" he cried. ""They are not mine or yours. I had nothing to do with them."" Darkness began to spread over the fields as Ray Pearson ran on and on. His breath came in little sobs. When he came to the fence at the edge of the road and confronted Hal Winters, all dressed up and smoking a pipe as he walked jauntily along, he could not have told what he thought or what he wanted. Ray Pearson lost his nerve and this is really the end of the story of what happened to him. It was almost dark when he got to the fence and he put his hands on the top bar and stood staring. Hal Winters jumped a ditch and coming up close to Ray put his hands into his pockets and laughed. He seemed to have lost his own sense of what had happened in the corn field and when he put up a strong hand and took hold of the lapel of Ray's coat he shook the old man as he might have shaken a dog that had misbehaved. ""You came to tell me, eh?"" he said. ""Well, never mind telling me anything. I'm not a coward and I've already made up my mind."" He laughed again and jumped back across the ditch. ""Nell ain't no fool,"" he said. ""She didn't ask me to marry her. I want to marry her. I want to settle down and have kids."" Ray Pearson also laughed. He felt like laughing at himself and all the world. As the form of Hal Winters disappeared in the dusk that lay over the road that led to Winesburg, he turned and walked slowly back across the fields to where he had left his torn overcoat. As he went some memory of pleasant evenings spent with the thin-legged children in the tumble-down house by the creek must have come into his mind, for he mut- tered words. ""It's just as well. Whatever I told him would have been a lie,"" he said softly, and then his form also disappeared into the darkness of the fields. DRINK TOM FOSTER came to Winesburg from Cincinnati when he was still young and could get many new impressions. His grandmother had been raised on a farm near the town and as a young girl had gone to school there when Winesburg was a village of twelve or fifteen houses clustered about a general store on the Trunion Pike. What a life the old woman had led since she went away from the frontier settlement and what a strong, capable little old thing she was! She had been in Kansas, in Canada, and in New York City, traveling about with her husband, a mechanic, be- fore he died. Later she went to stay with her daughter, who had also married a mechanic and lived in Covington, Kentucky, across the river from Cincinnati. Then began the hard years for Tom Foster's grandmother. First her son-in-law was killed by a policeman during a strike and then Tom's mother became an invalid and died also. The grandmother had saved a little money, but it was swept away by the illness of the daughter and by the cost of the two funerals. She became a half worn-out old woman worker and lived with the grandson above a junk shop on a side street in Cincinnati. For five years she scrubbed the floors in an office building and then got a place as dish washer in a restaurant. Her hands were all twisted out of shape. When she took hold of a mop or a broom handle the hands looked like the dried stems of an old creeping vine clinging to a tree. The old woman came back to Winesburg as soon as she got the chance. One evening as she was com- ing home from work she found a pocket-book con- taining thirty-seven dollars, and that opened the way. The trip was a great adventure for the boy. It was past seven o'clock at night when the grand- mother came home with the pocket-book held tightly in her old hands and she was so excited she could scarcely speak. She insisted on leaving Cincinnati that night, saying that if they stayed until morning the owner of the money would be sure to find them out and make trouble. Tom, who was then sixteen years old, had to go trudging off to the station with the old woman, bearing all of their earthly belong- ings done up in a worn-out blanket and slung across his back. By his side walked the grandmother urging him forward. Her toothless old mouth twitched ner- vously, and when Tom grew weary and wanted to put the pack down at a street crossing, she snatched it up and if he had not prevented would have slung it across her own back. When they got into the train and it had run out of the city she was as delighted as a girl and talked as the boy had never heard her talk before. All through the night as the train rattled along, the grandmother told Tom tales of Winesburg and of how he would enjoy his life working in the fields and shooting wild things in the woods there. She could not believe that the tiny village of fifty years before had grown into a thriving town in her ab- sence, and in the morning when the train came to Winesburg did not want to get off. ""It isn't what I thought. It may be hard for you here,"" she said, and then the train went on its way and the two stood confused, not knowing where to turn, in the pres- ence of Albert Longworth, the Winesburg baggage master. But Tom Foster did get along all right. He was one to get along anywhere. Mrs. White, the banker's wife, employed his grandmother to work in the kitchen and he got a place as stable boy in the bank- er's new brick barn. In Winesburg servants were hard to get. The woman who wanted help in her housework em- ployed a ""hired girl"" who insisted on sitting at the table with the family. Mrs. White was sick of hired girls and snatched at the chance to get hold of the old city woman. She furnished a room for the boy Tom upstairs in the barn. ""He can mow the lawn and run errands when the horses do not need atten- tion,"" she explained to her husband. Tom Foster was rather small for his age and had a large head covered with stiff black hair that stood straight up. The hair emphasized the bigness of his head. His voice was the softest thing imaginable, and he was himself so gentle and quiet that he slipped into the life of the town without attracting the least bit of attention. One could not help wondering where Tom Foster got his gentleness. In Cincinnati he had lived in a neighborhood where gangs of tough boys prowled through the streets, and all through his early forma- tive years he ran about with tough boys. For a while he was a messenger for a telegraph company and delivered messages in a neighborhood sprinkled with houses of prostitution. The women in the houses knew and loved Tom Foster and the tough boys in the gangs loved him also. He never asserted himself. That was one thing that helped him escape. In an odd way he stood in the shadow of the wall of life, was meant to stand in the shadow. He saw the men and women in the houses of lust, sensed their casual and horrible love affairs, saw boys fighting and listened to their tales of thieving and drunkenness, unmoved and strangely unaffected. Once Tom did steal. That was while he still lived in the city. The grandmother was ill at the time and he himself was out of work. There was nothing to eat in the house, and so he went into a harness shop on a side street and stole a dollar and seventy-five cents out of the cash drawer. The harness shop was run by an old man with a long mustache. He saw the boy lurking about and thought nothing of it. When he went out into the street to talk to a teamster Tom opened the cash drawer and taking the money walked away. Later he was caught and his grandmother settled the mat- ter by offering to come twice a week for a month and scrub the shop. The boy was ashamed, but he was rather glad, too. ""It is all right to be ashamed and makes me understand new things,"" he said to the grandmother, who didn't know what the boy was talking about but loved him so much that it didn't matter whether she understood or not. For a year Tom Foster lived in the banker's stable and then lost his place there. He didn't take very good care of the horses and he was a constant source of irritation to the banker's wife. She told him to mow the lawn and he forgot. Then she sent him to the store or to the post office and he did not come back but joined a group of men and boys and spent the whole afternoon with them, standing about, lis- tening and occasionally, when addressed, saying a few words. As in the city in the houses of prostitu- tion and with the rowdy boys running through the streets at night, so in Winesburg among its citizens he had always the power to be a part of and yet distinctly apart from the life about him. After Tom lost his place at Banker White's he did not live with his grandmother, although often in the evening she came to visit him. He rented a room at the rear of a little frame building belonging to old Rufus Whiting. The building was on Duane Street, just off Main Street, and had been used for years as a law office by the old man, who had become too feeble and forgetful for the practice of his profession but did not realize his inefficiency. He liked Tom and let him have the room for a dollar a month. In the late afternoon when the lawyer had gone home the boy had the place to himself and spent hours lying on the floor by the stove and thinking of things. In the evening the grandmother came and sat in the lawyer's chair to smoke a pipe while Tom remained silent, as he always, did in the presence of everyone. Often the old woman talked with great vigor. Sometimes she was angry about some happening at the banker's house and scolded away for hours. Out of her own earnings she bought a mop and regularly scrubbed the lawyer's office. Then when the place was spotlessly clean and smelled clean she lighted her clay pipe and she and Tom had a smoke to- gether. ""When you get ready to die then I will die also,"" she said to the boy lying on the floor beside her chair. Tom Foster enjoyed life in Winesburg. He did odd jobs, such as cutting wood for kitchen stoves and mowing the grass before houses. In late May and early June he picked strawberries in the fields. He had time to loaf and he enjoyed loafing. Banker White had given him a cast-off coat which was too large for him, but his grandmother cut it down, and he had also an overcoat, got at the same place, that was lined with fur. The fur was worn away in spots, but the coat was warm and in the winter Tom slept in it. He thought his method of getting along good enough and was happy and satisfied with the way fife in Winesburg had turned out for him. The most absurd little things made Tom Foster happy. That, I suppose, was why people loved him. In Hern's Grocery they would be roasting coffee on Friday afternoon, preparatory to the Saturday rush of trade, and the rich odor invaded lower Main Street. Tom Foster appeared and sat on a box at the rear of the store. For an hour he did not move but sat perfectly still, filling his being with the spicy odor that made him half drunk with happiness. ""I like it,"" he said gently. ""It makes me think of things far away, places and things like that."" One night Tom Foster got drunk. That came about in a curious way. He never had been drunk before, and indeed in all his fife had never taken a drink of anything intoxicating, but he felt he needed to be drunk that one time and so went and did it. In Cincinnati, when he lived there, Tom had found out many things, things about ugliness and crime and lust. Indeed, he knew more of these things than anyone else in Winesburg. The matter of sex in particular had presented itself to him in a quite horrible way and had made a deep impression on his mind. He thought, after what he had seen of the women standing before the squalid houses on cold nights and the look he had seen in the eyes of the men who stopped to talk to them, that he would put sex altogether out of his own life. One of the women of the neighborhood tempted him once and he went into a room with her. He never forgot the smell of the room nor the greedy look that came into the eyes of the woman. It sickened him and in a very terrible way left a scar on his soul. He had always before thought of women as quite innocent things, much like his grandmother, but after that one experience in the room he dismissed women from his mind. So gentle was his nature that he could not hate anything and not being able to under- stand he decided to forget. And Tom did forget until he came to Winesburg. After he had lived there for two years something began to stir in him. On all sides he saw youth mak- ing love and he was himself a youth. Before he knew what had happened he was in love also. He fell in love with Helen White, daughter of the man for whom he had worked, and found himself think- ing of her at night. That was a problem for Tom and he settled it in his own way. He let himself think of Helen White whenever her figure came into his mind and only concerned himself with the manner of his thoughts. He had a fight, a quiet determined little fight of his own, to keep his desires in the channel where he thought they belonged, but on the whole he was victorious. And then came the spring night when he got drunk. Tom was wild on that night. He was like an innocent young buck of the forest that has eaten of some maddening weed. The thing began, ran its course, and was ended in one night, and you may be sure that no one in Winesburg was any the worse for Tom's outbreak. In the first place, the night was one to make a sensitive nature drunk. The trees along the resi- dence streets of the town were all newly clothed in soft green leaves, in the gardens behind the houses men were puttering about in vegetable gardens, and in the air there was a hush, a waiting kind of silence very stirring to the blood. Tom left his room on Duane Street just as the young night began to make itself felt. First he walked through the streets, going softly and quietly along, thinking thoughts that he tried to put into words. He said that Helen White was a flame danc- ing in the air and that he was a little tree without leaves standing out sharply against the sky. Then he said that she was a wind, a strong terrible wind, coming out of the darkness of a stormy sea and that he was a boat left on the shore of the sea by a fisherman. That idea pleased the boy and he sauntered along playing with it. He went into Main Street and sat on the curbing before Wacker's tobacco store. For an hour he lingered about listening to the talk of men, but it did not interest him much and he slipped away. Then he decided to get drunk and went into Willy's saloon and bought a bottle of whiskey. Put- ting the bottle into his pocket, he walked out of town, wanting to be alone to think more thoughts and to drink the whiskey. Tom got drunk sitting on a bank of new grass beside the road about a mile north of town. Before him was a white road and at his back an apple or- chard in full bloom. He took a drink out of the bottle and then lay down on the grass. He thought of mornings in Winesburg and of how the stones in the graveled driveway by Banker White's house were wet with dew and glistened in the morning light. He thought of the nights in the barn when it rained and he lay awake hearing the drumming of the raindrops and smelling the warm smell of horses and of hay. Then he thought of a storm that had gone roaring through Winesburg several days before and, his mind going back, he relived the night he had spent on the train with his grandmother when the two were coming from Cincinnati. Sharply he remembered how strange it had seemed to sit qui- etly in the coach and to feel the power of the engine hurling the train along through the night. Tom got drunk in a very short time. He kept tak- ing drinks from the bottle as the thoughts visited him and when his head began to reel got up and walked along the road going away from Winesburg. There was a bridge on the road that ran out of Winesburg north to Lake Erie and the drunken boy made his way along the road to the bridge. There he sat down. He tried to drink again, but when he had taken the cork out of the bottle he became ill and put it quickly back. His head was rocking back and forth and so he sat on the stone approach to the bridge and sighed. His head seemed to be flying about like a pinwheel and then projecting itself off into space and his arms and legs flopped helplessly about. At eleven o'clock Tom got back into town. George Willard found him wandering about and took him into the Eagle printshop. Then he became afraid that the drunken boy would make a mess on the floor and helped him into the alleyway. The reporter was confused by Tom Foster. The drunken boy talked of Helen White and said he had been with her on the shore of a sea and had made love to her. George had seen Helen White walking in the street with her father during the evening and decided that Tom was out of his head. A sentiment concerning Helen White that lurked in his own heart flamed up and he became angry. ""Now you quit that,"" he said. ""I won't let Helen White's name be dragged into this. I won't let that happen."" He began shaking Tom's shoulder, trying to make him understand. ""You quit it,"" he said again. For three hours the two young men, thus strangely thrown together, stayed in the printshop. When he had a little recovered George took Tom for a walk. They went into the country and sat on a log near the edge of a wood. Something in the still night drew them together and when the drunken boy's head began to clear they talked. ""It was good to be drunk,"" Tom Foster said. ""It taught me something. I won't have to do it again. I will think more dearly after this. You see how it is."" George Willard did not see, but his anger concern- ing Helen White passed and he felt drawn toward the pale, shaken boy as he had never before been drawn toward anyone. With motherly solicitude, he insisted that Tom get to his feet and walk about. Again they went back to the printshop and sat in silence in the darkness.  Back to Full Books bySherwood Anderson The reporter could not get the purpose of Tom Foster's action straightened out in his mind. When Tom spoke again of Helen White he again grew angry and began to scold. ""You quit that,"" he said sharply. ""You haven't been with her. What makes you say you have? What makes you keep saying such things? Now you quit it, do you hear?"" Tom was hurt. He couldn't quarrel with George Willard because he was incapable of quarreling, so he got up to go away. When George Willard was insistent he put out his hand, laying it on the older boy's arm, and tried to explain. ""Well,"" he said softly, ""I don't know how it was. I was happy. You see how that was. Helen White made me happy and the night did too. I wanted to suffer, to be hurt somehow. I thought that was what I should do. I wanted to suffer, you see, because everyone suffers and does wrong. I thought of a lot of things to do, but they wouldn't work. They all hurt someone else."" Tom Foster's voice arose, and for once in his life he became almost excited. ""It was like making love, that's what I mean,"" he explained. ""Don't you see how it is? It hurt me to do what I did and made everything strange. That's why I did it. I'm glad, too. It taught me something, that's it, that's what I wanted. Don't you understand? I wanted to learn things, you see. That's why I did it."" DEATH THE STAIRWAY LEADING up to Doctor Reefy's office, in the Heffner Block above the Paris Dry Goods store, was but dimly lighted. At the head of the stairway hung a lamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a bracket to the wall. The lamp had a tin reflector, brown with rust and covered with dust. The people who went up the stairway followed with their feet the feet of many who had gone before. The soft boards of the stairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep hollows marked the way. At the top of the stairway a turn to the right brought you to the doctor's door. To the left was a dark hallway filled with rubbish. Old chairs, carpen- ter's horses, step ladders and empty boxes lay in the darkness waiting for shins to be barked. The pile of rubbish belonged to the Paris Dry Goods Company. When a counter or a row of shelves in the store became useless, clerks carried it up the stairway and threw it on the pile. Doctor Reefy's office was as large as a barn. A stove with a round paunch sat in the middle of the room. Around its base was piled sawdust, held in place by heavy planks nailed to the floor. By the door stood a huge table that had once been a part of the furniture of Herrick's Clothing Store and that had been used for displaying custom-made clothes. It was covered with books, bottles, and surgical in- struments. Near the edge of the table lay three or four apples left by John Spaniard, a tree nurseryman who was Doctor Reefy's friend, and who had slipped the apples out of his pocket as he came in at the door. At middle age Doctor Reefy was tall and awk- ward. The grey beard he later wore had not yet ap- peared, but on the upper lip grew a brown mustache. He was not a graceful man, as when he grew older, and was much occupied with the problem of dispos- ing of his hands and feet. On summer afternoons, when she had been mar- ried many years and when her son George was a boy of twelve or fourteen, Elizabeth Willard some- times went up the worn steps to Doctor Reefy's of- fice. Already the woman's naturally tall figure had begun to droop and to drag itself listlessly about. Ostensibly she went to see the doctor because of her health, but on the half dozen occasions when she had been to see him the outcome of the visits did not primarily concern her health. She and the doctor talked of that but they talked most of her life, of their two lives and of the ideas that had come to them as they lived their lives in Winesburg. In the big empty office the man and the woman sat looking at each other and they were a good deal alike. Their bodies were different, as were also the color of their eyes, the length of their noses, and the circumstances of their existence, but something inside them meant the same thing, wanted the same release, would have left the same impression on the memory of an onlooker. Later, and when he grew older and married a young wife, the doctor often talked to her of the hours spent with the sick woman and expressed a good many things he had been un- able to express to Elizabeth. He was almost a poet in his old age and his notion of what happened took a poetic turn. ""I had come to the time in my life when prayer became necessary and so I invented gods and prayed to them,"" he said. ""I did not say my prayers in words nor did I kneel down but sat perfectly still in my chair. In the late afternoon when it was hot and quiet on Main Street or in the winter when the days were gloomy, the gods came into the office and I thought no one knew about them. Then I found that this woman Elizabeth knew, that she worshipped also the same gods. I have a notion that she came to the office because she thought the gods would be there but she was happy to find herself not alone just the same. It was an experience that cannot be explained, although I suppose it is always happening to men and women in all sorts of places.""  On the summer afternoons when Elizabeth and the doctor sat in the office and talked of their two lives they talked of other lives also. Sometimes the doctor made philosophic epigrams. Then he chuck- led with amusement. Now and then after a period of silence, a word was said or a hint given that strangely illuminated the fife of the speaker, a wish became a desire, or a dream, half dead, flared sud- denly into life. For the most part the words came from the woman and she said them without looking at the man. Each time she came to see the doctor the hotel keeper's wife talked a little more freely and after an hour or two in his presence went down the stairway into Main Street feeling renewed and strengthened against the dullness of her days. With something approaching a girlhood swing to her body she walked along, but when she had got back to her chair by the window of her room and when dark- ness had come on and a girl from the hotel dining room brought her dinner on a tray, she let it grow cold. Her thoughts ran away to her girlhood with its passionate longing for adventure and she remem- bered the arms of men that had held her when ad- venture was a possible thing for her. Particularly she remembered one who had for a time been her lover and who in the moment of his passion had cried out to her more than a hundred times, saying the same words madly over and over: ""You dear! You dear! You lovely dear!"" The words, she thought, ex- pressed something she would have liked to have achieved in life. In her room in the shabby old hotel the sick wife of the hotel keeper began to weep and, putting her hands to her face, rocked back and forth. The words of her one friend, Doctor Reefy, rang in her ears. ""Love is like a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black night,"" he had said. ""You must not try to make love definite. It is the divine accident of life. If you try to be definite and sure about it and to live beneath the trees, where soft night winds blow, the long hot day of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from passing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made tender by kisses."" Elizabeth Willard could not remember her mother who had died when she was but five years old. Her girlhood had been lived in the most haphazard man- ner imaginable. Her father was a man who had wanted to be let alone and the affairs of the hotel would not let him alone. He also had lived and died a sick man. Every day he arose with a cheerful face, but by ten o'clock in the morning all the joy had gone out of his heart. When a guest complained of the fare in the hotel dining room or one of the girls who made up the beds got married and went away, he stamped on the floor and swore. At night when he went to bed he thought of his daughter growing up among the stream of people that drifted in and out of the hotel and was overcome with sadness. As the girl grew older and began to walk out in the evening with men he wanted to talk to her, but when he tried was not successful. He always forgot what he wanted to say and spent the time complain- ing of his own affairs. In her girlhood and young womanhood Elizabeth had tried to be a real adventurer in life. At eighteen life had so gripped her that she was no longer a virgin but, although she had a half dozen lovers before she married Tom Willard, she had never en- tered upon an adventure prompted by desire alone. Like all the women in the world, she wanted a real lover. Always there was something she sought blindly, passionately, some hidden wonder in life. The tall beautiful girl with the swinging stride who had walked under the trees with men was forever putting out her hand into the darkness and trying to get hold of some other hand. In all the babble of words that fell from the lips of the men with whom she adventured she was trying to find what would be for her the true word, Elizabeth had married Tom Willard, a clerk in her father's hotel, because he was at hand and wanted to marry at the time when the determination to marry came to her. For a while, like most young girls, she thought marriage would change the face of life. If there was in her mind a doubt of the out- come of the marriage with Tom she brushed it aside. Her father was ill and near death at the time and she was perplexed because of the meaningless out- come of an affair in which she had just been in- volved. Other girls of her age in Winesburg were marrying men she had always known, grocery clerks or young farmers. In the evening they walked in Main Street with their husbands and when she passed they smiled happily. She began to think that the fact of marriage might be full of some hidden significance. Young wives with whom she talked spoke softly and shyly. ""It changes things to have a man of your own,"" they said. On the evening before her marriage the perplexed girl had a talk with her father. Later she wondered if the hours alone with the sick man had not led to her decision to marry. The father talked of his life and advised the daughter to avoid being led into another such muddle. He abused Tom Willard, and that led Elizabeth to come to the clerk's defense. The sick man became excited and tried to get out of bed. When she would not let him walk about he began to complain. ""I've never been let alone,"" he said. ""Although I've worked hard I've not made the hotel pay. Even now I owe money at the bank. You'll find that out when I'm gone."" The voice of the sick man became tense with ear- nestness. Being unable to arise, he put out his hand and pulled the girl's head down beside his own. ""There's a way out,"" he whispered. ""Don't marry Tom Willard or anyone else here in Winesburg. There is eight hundred dollars in a tin box in my trunk. Take it and go away."" Again the sick man's voice became querulous. ""You've got to promise,"" he declared. ""If you won't promise not to marry, give me your word that you'll never tell Tom about the money. It is mine and if I give it to you I've the right to make that demand. Hide it away. It is to make up to you for my failure as a father. Some time it may prove to be a door, a great open door to you. Come now, I tell you I'm about to die, give me your promise.""  In Doctor Reefy's office, Elizabeth, a tired gaunt old woman at forty-one, sat in a chair near the stove and looked at the floor. By a small desk near the window sat the doctor. His hands played with a lead pencil that lay on the desk. Elizabeth talked of her life as a married woman. She became impersonal and forgot her husband, only using him as a lay figure to give point to her tale. ""And then I was married and it did not turn out at all,"" she said bitterly. ""As soon as I had gone into it I began to be afraid. Perhaps I knew too much before and then perhaps I found out too much during my first night with him. I don't remember. ""What a fool I was. When father gave me the money and tried to talk me out of the thought of marriage, I would not listen. I thought of what the girls who were married had said of it and I wanted marriage also. It wasn't Tom I wanted, it was mar- riage. When father went to sleep I leaned out of the window and thought of the life I had led. I didn't want to be a bad woman. The town was full of sto- ries about me. I even began to be afraid Tom would change his mind."" The woman's voice began to quiver with excite- ment. To Doctor Reefy, who without realizing what was happening had begun to love her, there came an odd illusion. He thought that as she talked the woman's body was changing, that she was becom- ing younger, straighter, stronger. When he could not shake off the illusion his mind gave it a profes- sional twist. ""It is good for both her body and her mind, this talking,"" he muttered. The woman began telling of an incident that had happened one afternoon a few months after her marriage. Her voice became steadier. ""In the late afternoon I went for a drive alone,"" she said. ""I had a buggy and a little grey pony I kept in Moyer's Livery. Tom was painting and repapering rooms in the hotel. He wanted money and I was trying to make up my mind to tell him about the eight hun- dred dollars father had given to me. I couldn't de- cide to do it. I didn't like him well enough. There was always paint on his hands and face during those days and he smelled of paint. He was trying to fix up the old hotel, and make it new and smart."" The excited woman sat up very straight in her chair and made a quick girlish movement with her hand as she told of the drive alone on the spring afternoon. ""It was cloudy and a storm threatened,"" she said. ""Black clouds made the green of the trees and the grass stand out so that the colors hurt my eyes. I went out Trunion Pike a mile or more and then turned into a side road. The little horse went quickly along up hill and down. I was impatient. Thoughts came and I wanted to get away from my thoughts. I began to beat the horse. The black clouds settled down and it began to rain. I wanted to go at a terrible speed, to drive on and on forever. I wanted to get out of town, out of my clothes, out of my marriage, out of my body, out of everything. I almost killed the horse, making him run, and when he could not run any more I got out of the buggy and ran afoot into the darkness until I fell and hurt my side. I wanted to run away from everything but I wanted to run towards something too. Don't you see, dear, how it was?"" Elizabeth sprang out of the chair and began to walk about in the office. She walked as Doctor Reefy thought he had never seen anyone walk before. To her whole body there was a swing, a rhythm that intoxicated him. When she came and knelt on the floor beside his chair he took her into his arms and began to kiss her passionately. ""I cried all the way home,"" she said, as she tried to continue the story of her wild ride, but he did not listen. ""You dear! You lovely dear! Oh you lovely dear!"" he muttered and thought he held in his arms not the tired-out woman of forty-one but a lovely and innocent girl who had been able by some miracle to project her- self out of the husk of the body of the tired-out woman. Doctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his arms again until after her death. On the sum- mer afternoon in the office when he was on the point of becoming her lover a half grotesque little incident brought his love-making quickly to an end. As the man and woman held each other tightly heavy feet came tramping up the office stairs. The two sprang to their feet and stood listening and trembling. The noise on the stairs was made by a clerk from the Paris Dry Goods Company. With a loud bang he threw an empty box on the pile of rubbish in the hallway and then went heavily down the stairs. Elizabeth followed him almost immedi- ately. The thing that had come to life in her as she talked to her one friend died suddenly. She was hysterical, as was also Doctor Reefy, and did not want to continue the talk. Along the street she went with the blood still singing in her body, but when she turned out of Main Street and saw ahead the lights of the New Willard House, she began to trem- ble and her knees shook so that for a moment she thought she would fall in the street. The sick woman spent the last few months of her life hungering for death. Along the road of death she went, seeking, hungering. She personified the figure of death and made him now a strong black- haired youth running over hills, now a stem quiet man marked and scarred by the business of living. In the darkness of her room she put out her hand, thrusting it from under the covers of her bed, and she thought that death like a living thing put out his hand to her. ""Be patient, lover,"" she whispered. ""Keep yourself young and beautiful and be patient."" On the evening when disease laid its heavy hand upon her and defeated her plans for telling her son George of the eight hundred dollars hidden away, she got out of bed and crept half across the room pleading with death for another hour of life. ""Wait, dear! The boy! The boy! The boy!"" she pleaded as she tried with all of her strength to fight off the arms of the lover she had wanted so earnestly.  Elizabeth died one day in March in the year when her son George became eighteen, and the young man had but little sense of the meaning of her death. Only time could give him that. For a month he had seen her lying white and still and speechless in her bed, and then one afternoon the doctor stopped him in the hallway and said a few words. The young man went into his own room and closed the door. He had a queer empty feeling in the region of his stomach. For a moment he sat star- ing at, the floor and then jumping up went for a walk. Along the station platform he went, and around through residence streets past the high- school building, thinking almost entirely of his own affairs. The notion of death could not get hold of him and he was in fact a little annoyed that his mother had died on that day. He had just received a note from Helen White, the daughter of the town banker, in answer to one from him. ""Tonight I could have gone to see her and now it will have to be put off,"" he thought half angrily. Elizabeth died on a Friday afternoon at three o'clock. It had been cold and rainy in the morning but in the afternoon the sun came out. Before she died she lay paralyzed for six days unable to speak or move and with only her mind and her eyes alive. For three of the six days she struggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say some few words in regard to his future, and in her eyes there was an appeal so touching that all who saw it kept the memory of the dying woman in their minds for years. Even Tom Willard, who had always half resented his wife, for- got his resentment and the tears ran out of his eyes and lodged in his mustache. The mustache had begun to turn grey and Tom colored it with dye. There was oil in the preparation he used for the purpose and the tears, catching in the mustache and being brushed away by his hand, formed a fine mist- like vapor. In his grief Tom Willard's face looked like the face of a little dog that has been out a long time in bitter weather. George came home along Main Street at dark on the day of his mother's death and, after going to his own room to brush his hair and clothes, went along the hallway and into the room where the body lay. There was a candle on the dressing table by the door and Doctor Reefy sat in a chair by the bed. The doctor arose and started to go out. He put out his hand as though to greet the younger man and then awkwardly drew it back again. The air of the room was heavy with the presence of the two self- conscious human beings, and the man hurried away. The dead woman's son sat down in a chair and looked at the floor. He again thought of his own affairs and definitely decided he would make a change in his fife, that he would leave Winesburg. ""I will go to some city. Perhaps I can get a job on some newspaper,"" he thought, and then his mind turned to the girl with whom he was to have spent this evening and again he was half angry at the turn of events that had prevented his going to her. In the dimly lighted room with the dead woman the young man began to have thoughts. His mind played with thoughts of life as his mother's mind had played with the thought of death. He closed his eyes and imagined that the red young lips of Helen White touched his own lips. His body trembled and his hands shook. And then something happened. The boy sprang to his feet and stood stiffly. He looked at the figure of the dead woman under the sheets and shame for his thoughts swept over him so that he began to weep. A new notion came into his mind and he turned and looked guiltily about as though afraid he would be observed. George Willard became possessed of a madness to lift the sheet from the body of his mother and look at her face. The thought that had come into his mind gripped him terribly. He became convinced that not his mother but someone else lay in the bed before him. The conviction was so real that it was almost unbearable. The body under the sheets was long and in death looked young and graceful. To the boy, held by some strange fancy, it was unspeakably lovely. The feeling that the body before him was alive, that in another moment a lovely woman would spring out of the bed and confront him, be- came so overpowering that he could not bear the suspense. Again and again he put out his hand. Once he touched and half lifted the white sheet that covered her, but his courage failed and he, like Doc- tor Reefy, turned and went out of the room. In the hallway outside the door he stopped and trembled so that he had to put a hand against the wall to support himself. ""That's not my mother. That's not my mother in there,"" he whispered to himself and again his body shook with fright and uncertainty. When Aunt Elizabeth Swift, who had come to watch over the body, came out of an adjoining room he put his hand into hers and began to sob, shaking his head from side to side, half blind with grief. ""My mother is dead,"" he said, and then forgetting the woman he turned and stared at the door through which he had just come. ""The dear, the dear, oh the lovely dear,"" the boy, urged by some impulse outside himself, muttered aloud. As for the eight hundred dollars the dead woman had kept hidden so long and that was to give George Willard his start in the city, it lay in the tin box behind the plaster by the foot of his mother's bed. Elizabeth had put it there a week after her mar- riage, breaking the plaster away with a stick. Then she got one of the workmen her husband was at that time employing about the hotel to mend the wall. ""I jammed the corner of the bed against it,"" she had explained to her husband, unable at the moment to give up her dream of release, the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms. SOPHISTICATION IT WAS EARLY evening of a day in, the late fall and the Winesburg County Fair had brought crowds of country people into town. The day had been clear and the night came on warm and pleasant. On the Trunion Pike, where the road after it left town stretched away between berry fields now covered with dry brown leaves, the dust from passing wag- ons arose in clouds. Children, curled into little balls, slept on the straw scattered on wagon beds. Their hair was full of dust and their fingers black and sticky. The dust rolled away over the fields and the departing sun set it ablaze with colors. In the main street of Winesburg crowds filled the stores and the sidewalks. Night came on, horses whinnied, the clerks in the stores ran madly about, children became lost and cried lustily, an American town worked terribly at the task of amusing itself. Pushing his way through the crowds in Main Street, young George Willard concealed himself in the stairway leading to Doctor Reefy's office and looked at the people. With feverish eyes he watched the faces drifting past under the store lights. Thoughts kept coming into his head and he did not want to think. He stamped impatiently on the wooden steps and looked sharply about. ""Well, is she going to stay with him all day? Have I done all this waiting for nothing?"" he muttered. George Willard, the Ohio village boy, was fast growing into manhood and new thoughts had been coming into his mind. All that day, amid the jam of people at the Fair, he had gone about feeling lonely. He was about to leave Winesburg to go away to some city where he hoped to get work on a city newspaper and he felt grown up. The mood that had taken possession of him was a thing known to men and unknown to boys. He felt old and a little tired. Memories awoke in him. To his mind his new sense of maturity set him apart, made of him a half- tragic figure. He wanted someone to understand the feeling that had taken possession of him after his mother's death. There is a time in the life of every boy when he for the first time takes the backward view of life. Perhaps that is the moment when he crosses the line into manhood. The boy is walking through the street of his town. He is thinking of the future and of the figure he will cut in the world. Ambitions and re- grets awake within him. Suddenly something hap- pens; he stops under a tree and waits as for a voice calling his name. Ghosts of old things creep into his consciousness; the voices outside of himself whisper a message concerning the limitations of life. From being quite sure of himself and his future he be- comes not at all sure. If he be an imaginative boy a door is tom open and for the first time he looks out upon the world, seeing, as though they marched in procession before him, the countless figures of men who before his time have come out of nothingness into the world, lived their lives and again disap- peared into nothingness. The sadness of sophistica- tion has come to the boy. With a little gasp he sees himself as merely a leaf blown by the wind through the streets of his village. He knows that in spite of all the stout talk of his fellows he must live and die in uncertainty, a thing blown by the winds, a thing destined like corn to wilt in the sun. He shivers and looks eagerly about. The eighteen years he has lived seem but a moment, a breathing space in the long march of humanity. Already he hears death calling. With all his heart he wants to come close to some other human, touch someone with his hands, be touched by the hand of another. If he prefers that the other be a woman, that is because he believes that a woman will be gentle, that she will under- stand. He wants, most of all, understanding. When the moment of sophistication came to George Willard his mind turned to Helen White, the Wines- burg banker's daughter. Always he had been con- scious of the girl growing into womanhood as he grew into manhood. Once on a summer night when he was eighteen, he had walked with her on a coun- try road and in her presence had given way to an impulse to boast, to make himself appear big and significant in her eyes. Now he wanted to see her for another purpose. He wanted to tell her of the new impulses that had come to him. He had tried to make her think of him as a man when he knew nothing of manhood and now he wanted to be with her and to try to make her feel the change he be- lieved had taken place in his nature. As for Helen White, she also had come to a period of change. What George felt, she in her young wom- an's way felt also. She was no longer a girl and hungered to reach into the grace and beauty of womanhood. She had come home from Cleveland, where she was attending college, to spend a day at the Fair. She also had begun to have memories. Dur- ing the day she sat in the grand-stand with a young man, one of the instructors from the college, who was a guest of her mother's. The young man was of a pedantic turn of mind and she felt at once he would not do for her purpose. At the Fair she was glad to be seen in his company as he was well dressed and a stranger. She knew that the fact of his presence would create an impression. During the day she was happy, but when night came on she began to grow restless. She wanted to drive the in- structor away, to get out of his presence. While they sat together in the grand-stand and while the eyes of former schoolmates were upon them, she paid so much attention to her escort that he grew interested. ""A scholar needs money. I should marry a woman with money,"" he mused. Helen White was thinking of George Willard even as he wandered gloomily through the crowds think- ing of her. She remembered the summer evening when they had walked together and wanted to walk with him again. She thought that the months she had spent in the city, the going to theaters and the seeing of great crowds wandering in lighted thor- oughfares, had changed her profoundly. She wanted him to feel and be conscious of the change in her nature. The summer evening together that had left its mark on the memory of both the young man and woman had, when looked at quite sensibly, been rather stupidly spent. They had walked out of town along a country road. Then they had stopped by a fence near a field of young corn and George had taken off his coat and let it hang on his arm. ""Well, I've stayed here in Winesburg--yes--I've not yet gone away but I'm growing up,"" he had said. ""I've been reading books and I've been thinking. I'm going to try to amount to something in life. ""Well,"" he explained, ""that isn't the point. Per- haps I'd better quit talking."" The confused boy put his hand on the girl's arm. His voice trembled. The two started to walk back along the road toward town. In his desperation George boasted, ""I'm going to be a big man, the biggest that ever lived here in Winesburg,"" he de- clared. ""I want you to do something, I don't know what. Perhaps it is none of my business. I want you to try to be different from other women. You see the point. It's none of my business I tell you. I want you to be a beautiful woman. You see what I want."" The boy's voice failed and in silence the two came back into town and went along the street to Helen White's house. At the gate he tried to say something impressive. Speeches he had thought out came into his head, but they seemed utterly pointless. ""I thought--I used to think--I had it in my mind you would marry Seth Richmond. Now I know you won't,"" was all he could find to say as she went through the gate and toward the door of her house. On the warm fall evening as he stood in the stair- way and looked at the crowd drifting through Main Street, George thought of the talk beside the field of young corn and was ashamed of the figure he had made of himself. In the street the people surged up and down like cattle confined in a pen. Buggies and wagons almost filled the narrow thoroughfare. A band played and small boys raced along the side- walk, diving between the legs of men. Young men with shining red faces walked awkwardly about with girls on their arms. In a room above one of the stores, where a dance was to be held, the fiddlers tuned their instruments. The broken sounds floated down through an open window and out across the murmur of voices and the loud blare of the horns of the band. The medley of sounds got on young Willard's nerves. Everywhere, on all sides, the sense of crowding, moving life closed in about him. He wanted to run away by himself and think. ""If she wants to stay with that fellow she may. Why should I care? What difference does it make to me?"" he growled and went along Main Street and through Hern's Grocery into a side street. George felt so utterly lonely and dejected that he wanted to weep but pride made him walk rapidly along, swinging his arms. He came to Wesley Moy- er's livery barn and stopped in the shadows to listen to a group of men who talked of a race Wesley's stallion, Tony Tip, had won at the Fair during the afternoon. A crowd had gathered in front of the barn and before the crowd walked Wesley, prancing up and down boasting. He held a whip in his hand and kept tapping the ground. Little puffs of dust arose in the lamplight. ""Hell, quit your talking,"" Wesley exclaimed. ""I wasn't afraid, I knew I had 'em beat all the time. I wasn't afraid."" Ordinarily George Willard would have been in- tensely interested in the boasting of Moyer, the horseman. Now it made him angry. He turned and hurried away along the street. ""Old windbag,"" he sputtered. ""Why does he want to be bragging? Why don't he shut up?"" George went into a vacant lot and, as he hurried along, fell over a pile of rubbish. A nail protruding from an empty barrel tore his trousers. He sat down on the ground and swore. With a pin he mended the torn place and then arose and went on. ""I'll go to Helen White's house, that's what I'll do. I'll walk right in. I'll say that I want to see her. I'll walk right in and sit down, that's what I'll do,"" he declared, climbing over a fence and beginning to run.  On the veranda of Banker White's house Helen was restless and distraught. The instructor sat be- tween the mother and daughter. His talk wearied the girl. Although he had also been raised in an Ohio town, the instructor began to put on the airs of the city. He wanted to appear cosmopolitan. ""I like the chance you have given me to study the back- ground out of which most of our girls come,"" he declared. ""It was good of you, Mrs. White, to have me down for the day."" He turned to Helen and laughed. ""Your life is still bound up with the life of this town?"" he asked. ""There are people here in whom you are interested?"" To the girl his voice sounded pompous and heavy. Helen arose and went into the house. At the door leading to a garden at the back she stopped and stood listening. Her mother began to talk. ""There is no one here fit to associate with a girl of Helen's breeding,"" she said. Helen ran down a flight of stairs at the back of the house and into the garden. In the darkness she stopped and stood trembling. It seemed to her that the world was full of meaningless people saying words. Afire with eagerness she ran through a gar- den gate and, turning a corner by the banker's barn, went into a little side street. ""George! Where are you, George?"" she cried, filled with nervous excite- ment. She stopped running, and leaned against a tree to laugh hysterically. Along the dark little street came George Willard, still saying words. ""I'm going to walk right into her house. I'll go right in and sit down, "" he declared as he came up to her. He stopped and stared stupidly. ""Come on,"" he said and took hold of her hand. With hanging heads they walked away along the street under the trees. Dry leaves rustled under foot. Now that he had found her George wondered what he had better do and say.  At the upper end of the Fair Ground, in Wines- burg, there is a half decayed old grand-stand. It has never been painted and the boards are all warped out of shape. The Fair Ground stands on top of a low hill rising out of the valley of Wine Creek and from the grand-stand one can see at night, over a cornfield, the lights of the town reflected against the sky. George and Helen climbed the hill to the Fair Ground, coming by the path past Waterworks Pond. The feeling of loneliness and isolation that had come to the young man in the crowded streets of his town was both broken and intensified by the presence of Helen. What he felt was reflected in her. In youth there are always two forces fighting in people. The warm unthinking little animal struggles against the thing that reflects and remembers, and the older, the more sophisticated thing had posses- sion of George Willard. Sensing his mood, Helen walked beside him filled with respect. When they got to the grand-stand they climbed up under the roof and sat down on one of the long bench-like seats. There is something memorable in the experience to be had by going into a fair ground that stands at the edge of a Middle Western town on a night after the annual fair has been held. The sensation is one never to be forgotten. On all sides are ghosts, not of the dead, but of living people. Here, during the day just passed, have come the people pouring in from the town and the country around. Farmers with their wives and children and all the people from the hundreds of little frame houses have gath- ered within these board walls. Young girls have laughed and men with beards have talked of the affairs of their lives. The place has been filled to overflowing with life. It has itched and squirmed with life and now it is night and the life has all gone away. The silence is almost terrifying. One conceals oneself standing silently beside the trunk of a tree and what there is of a reflective tendency in his na- ture is intensified. One shudders at the thought of the meaninglessness of life while at the same in- stant, and if the people of the town are his people, one loves life so intensely that tears come into the eyes. In the darkness under the roof of the grand-stand, George Willard sat beside Helen White and felt very keenly his own insignificance in the scheme of exis- tence. Now that he had come out of town where the presence of the people stirring about, busy with a multitude of affairs, had been so irritating, the irritation was all gone. The presence of Helen re- newed and refreshed him. It was as though her woman's hand was assisting him to make some mi- nute readjustment of the machinery of his life. He began to think of the people in the town where he had always lived with something like reverence. He had reverence for Helen. He wanted to love and to be loved by her, but he did not want at the mo- ment to be confused by her womanhood. In the darkness he took hold of her hand and when she crept close put a hand on her shoulder. A wind began to blow and he shivered. With all his strength he tried to hold and to understand the mood that had come upon him. In that high place in the dark- ness the two oddly sensitive human atoms held each other tightly and waited. In the mind of each was the same thought. ""I have come to this lonely place and here is this other,"" was the substance of the thing felt. In Winesburg the crowded day had run itself out into the long night of the late fall. Farm horses jogged away along lonely country roads pulling their portion of weary people. Clerks began to bring sam- ples of goods in off the sidewalks and lock the doors of stores. In the Opera House a crowd had gathered to see a show and further down Main Street the fiddlers, their instruments tuned, sweated and worked to keep the feet of youth flying over a dance floor. In the darkness in the grand-stand Helen White and George Willard remained silent. Now and then the spell that held them was broken and they turned and tried in the dim light to see into each other's eyes. They kissed but that impulse did not last. At the upper end of the Fair Ground a half dozen men worked over horses that had raced during the after- noon. The men had built a fire and were heating kettles of water. Only their legs could be seen as they passed back and forth in the light. When the wind blew the little flames of the fire danced crazily about. George and Helen arose and walked away into the darkness. They went along a path past a field of corn that had not yet been cut. The wind whispered among the dry corn blades. For a moment during the walk back into town the spell that held them was broken. When they had come to the crest of Waterworks Hill they stopped by a tree and George again put his hands on the girl's shoulders. She em- braced him eagerly and then again they drew quickly back from that impulse. They stopped kiss- ing and stood a little apart. Mutual respect grew big in them. They were both embarrassed and to relieve their embarrassment dropped into the animalism of youth. They laughed and began to pull and haul at each other. In some way chastened and purified by the mood they had been in, they became, not man and woman, not boy and girl, but excited little animals. It was so they went down the hill. In the darkness they played like two splendid young things in a young world. Once, running swiftly forward, Helen tripped George and he fell. He squirmed and shouted. Shaking with laughter, he roiled down the hill. Helen ran after him. For just a moment she stopped in the darkness. There was no way of knowing what woman's thoughts went through her mind but, when the bottom of the hill was reached and she came up to the boy, she took his arm and walked beside him in dignified silence. For some reason they could not have explained they had both got from their silent evening together the thing needed. Man or boy, woman or girl, they had for a moment taken hold of the thing that makes the mature life of men and women in the modern world possible.  DEPARTURE YOUNG GEORGE WILLARD got out of bed at four in the morning. It was April and the young tree leaves were just coming out of their buds. The trees along the residence streets in Winesburg are maple and the seeds are winged. When the wind blows they whirl crazily about, filling the air and making a car- pet underfoot. George came downstairs into the hotel office car- rying a brown leather bag. His trunk was packed for departure. Since two o'clock he had been awake thinking of the journey he was about to take and wondering what he would find at the end of his journey. The boy who slept in the hotel office lay on a cot by the door. His mouth was open and he snored lustily. George crept past the cot and went out into the silent deserted main street. The east was pink with the dawn and long streaks of light climbed into the sky where a few stars still shone. Beyond the last house on Trunion Pike in Wines- burg there is a great stretch of open fields. The fields are owned by farmers who live in town and drive homeward at evening along Trunion Pike in light creaking wagons. In the fields are planted berries and small fruits. In the late afternoon in the hot summers when the road and the fields are covered with dust, a smoky haze lies over the great flat basin of land. To look across it is like looking out across the sea. In the spring when the land is green the effect is somewhat different. The land becomes a wide green billiard table on which tiny human in- sects toil up and down. All through his boyhood and young manhood George Willard had been in the habit of walking on Trunion Pike. He had been in the midst of the great open place on winter nights when it was covered with snow and only the moon looked down at him; he had been there in the fall when bleak winds blew and on summer evenings when the air vibrated with the song of insects. On the April morning he wanted to go there again, to walk again in the silence. He did walk to where the road dipped down by a little stream two miles from town and then turned and walked silently back again. When he got to Main Street clerks were sweeping the sidewalks before the stores. ""Hey, you George. How does it feel to be going away?"" they asked. The westbound train leaves Winesburg at seven forty-five in the morning. Tom Little is conductor. His train runs from Cleveland to where it connects with a great trunk line railroad with terminals in Chicago and New York. Tom has what in railroad circles is called an ""easy run."" Every evening he returns to his family. In the fall and spring he spends his Sundays fishing in Lake Erie. He has a round red face and small blue eyes. He knows the people in the towns along his railroad better than a city man knows the people who live in his apart- ment building. George came down the little incline from the New Willard House at seven o'clock. Tom Willard carried his bag. The son had become taller than the father. On the station platform everyone shook the young man's hand. More than a dozen people waited about. Then they talked of their own affairs. Even Will Henderson, who was lazy and often slept until nine, had got out of bed. George was embarrassed. Gertrude Wilmot, a tall thin woman of fifty who worked in the Winesburg post office, came along the station platform. She had never before paid any attention to George. Now she stopped and put out her hand. In two words she voiced what everyone felt. ""Good luck,"" she said sharply and then turning went on her way. When the train came into the station George felt relieved. He scampered hurriedly aboard. Helen White came running along Main Street hoping to have a parting word with him, but he had found a seat and did not see her. When the train started Tom Little punched his ticket, grinned and, although he knew George well and knew on what adventure he was just setting out, made no comment. Tom had seen a thousand George Willards go out of their towns to the city. It was a commonplace enough incident with him. In the smoking car there was a man who had just invited Tom to go on a fishing trip to Sandusky Bay. He wanted to accept the invi- tation and talk over details. George glanced up and down the car to be sure no one was looking, then took out his pocketbook and counted his money. His mind was occupied with a desire not to appear green. Almost the last words his father had said to him concerned the mat- ter of his behavior when he got to the city. ""Be a sharp one,"" Tom Willard had said. ""Keep your eyes on your money. Be awake. That's the ticket. Don't let anyone think you're a greenhorn."" After George counted his money he looked out of the window and was surprised to see that the train was still in Winesburg. The young man, going out of his town to meet the adventure of life, began to think but he did not think of anything very big or dramatic. Things like his mother's death, his departure from Winesburg, the uncertainty of his future life in the city, the seri- ous and larger aspects of his life did not come into his mind. He thought of little things--Turk Smollet wheel- ing boards through the main street of his town in the morning, a tall woman, beautifully gowned, who had once stayed overnight at his father's hotel, Butch Wheeler the lamp lighter of Winesburg hur- rying through the streets on a summer evening and holding a torch in his hand, Helen White standing by a window in the Winesburg post office and put- ting a stamp on an envelope. The young man's mind was carried away by his growing passion for dreams. One looking at him would not have thought him particularly sharp. With the recollection of little things occupying his mind he closed his eyes and leaned back in the car seat. He stayed that way for a long time and when he aroused himself and again looked out of the car window the town of Winesburg had disappeared and his life there had become but a background on which to paint the dreams of his manhood. "
"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Death"," Elizabeth Willard often visited Doctor Reefy in her middle age. Together, they would discuss their lives and people in town. They became friends and almost became lovers. She told him about her life and when she spoke, she seemed like a younger woman, not the old, worn out woman she had become. When she tried to communicate how she had longed for love, he embraced her. Just then, they were interrupted by footsteps and she ran out of Doctor Reefy's office. Elizabeth explained to her friend that she had had several lovers before marrying Tom Willard, and she had married him because he was available when she was ready to be married. Her father tried to convince her not to marry Tom, but to take $800 he had saved and flee. When she decided to marry Tom anyway, he gave her the money and encouraged her never to tell Tom about it. Very quickly, her marriage was a disappointment. She hid the money behind her wall and left it there for many years. She died before she could tell her son George, who is eighteen years old, about the money. After his mother's death, George decided he would leave Winesburg and get a job on a city newspaper somewhere. As he sat in the room with his mother's corpse, he also imagined himself kissing Helen White, but then he felt ashamed of his thoughts and began to cry. He left the room sobbing and full of grief. Analysis In this text, people are caged by their lives and their beliefs.  and passion both represent a type of escape or release from the unhappiness of everyday life. Elizabeth held onto the money, hoping for ""the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers  and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms"" (236). The passions of sexual desire or of death are both promises of release from the strictures that keep people from connecting with one another.  Caught up in the release that comes with passion of any kind, three men call Elizabeth ""You dear! You lovely dear!"" (231), but they cannot provide her with a permanent release because they do not fully understand her and only express this appreciation in moments of passion. Once the passion is over, the connection between the two people fades and the people are left with the cages of everyday life. ","Winesburg, Ohio",Death," THE STAIRWAY LEADING up to Doctor Reefy's office, in the Heffner Block above the Paris Dry Goods store, was but dimly lighted. At the head of the stairway hung a lamp with a dirty chimney that was fastened by a bracket to the wall. The lamp had a tin reflector, brown with rust and covered with dust. The people who went up the stairway followed with their feet the feet of many who had gone before. The soft boards of the stairs had yielded under the pressure of feet and deep hollows marked the way. At the top of the stairway a turn to the right brought you to the doctor's door. To the left was a dark hallway filled with rubbish. Old chairs, carpen- ter's horses, step ladders and empty boxes lay in the darkness waiting for shins to be barked. The pile of rubbish belonged to the Paris Dry Goods Company. When a counter or a row of shelves in the store became useless, clerks carried it up the stairway and threw it on the pile. Doctor Reefy's office was as large as a barn. A stove with a round paunch sat in the middle of the room. Around its base was piled sawdust, held in place by heavy planks nailed to the floor. By the door stood a huge table that had once been a part of the furniture of Herrick's Clothing Store and that had been used for displaying custom-made clothes. It was covered with books, bottles, and surgical in- struments. Near the edge of the table lay three or four apples left by John Spaniard, a tree nurseryman who was Doctor Reefy's friend, and who had slipped the apples out of his pocket as he came in at the door. At middle age Doctor Reefy was tall and awk- ward. The grey beard he later wore had not yet ap- peared, but on the upper lip grew a brown mustache. He was not a graceful man, as when he grew older, and was much occupied with the problem of dispos- ing of his hands and feet. On summer afternoons, when she had been mar- ried many years and when her son George was a boy of twelve or fourteen, Elizabeth Willard some- times went up the worn steps to Doctor Reefy's of- fice. Already the woman's naturally tall figure had begun to droop and to drag itself listlessly about. Ostensibly she went to see the doctor because of her health, but on the half dozen occasions when she had been to see him the outcome of the visits did not primarily concern her health. She and the doctor talked of that but they talked most of her life, of their two lives and of the ideas that had come to them as they lived their lives in Winesburg. In the big empty office the man and the woman sat looking at each other and they were a good deal alike. Their bodies were different, as were also the color of their eyes, the length of their noses, and the circumstances of their existence, but something inside them meant the same thing, wanted the same release, would have left the same impression on the memory of an onlooker. Later, and when he grew older and married a young wife, the doctor often talked to her of the hours spent with the sick woman and expressed a good many things he had been un- able to express to Elizabeth. He was almost a poet in his old age and his notion of what happened took a poetic turn. ""I had come to the time in my life when prayer became necessary and so I invented gods and prayed to them,"" he said. ""I did not say my prayers in words nor did I kneel down but sat perfectly still in my chair. In the late afternoon when it was hot and quiet on Main Street or in the winter when the days were gloomy, the gods came into the office and I thought no one knew about them. Then I found that this woman Elizabeth knew, that she worshipped also the same gods. I have a notion that she came to the office because she thought the gods would be there but she was happy to find herself not alone just the same. It was an experience that cannot be explained, although I suppose it is always happening to men and women in all sorts of places.""  On the summer afternoons when Elizabeth and the doctor sat in the office and talked of their two lives they talked of other lives also. Sometimes the doctor made philosophic epigrams. Then he chuck- led with amusement. Now and then after a period of silence, a word was said or a hint given that strangely illuminated the fife of the speaker, a wish became a desire, or a dream, half dead, flared sud- denly into life. For the most part the words came from the woman and she said them without looking at the man. Each time she came to see the doctor the hotel keeper's wife talked a little more freely and after an hour or two in his presence went down the stairway into Main Street feeling renewed and strengthened against the dullness of her days. With something approaching a girlhood swing to her body she walked along, but when she had got back to her chair by the window of her room and when dark- ness had come on and a girl from the hotel dining room brought her dinner on a tray, she let it grow cold. Her thoughts ran away to her girlhood with its passionate longing for adventure and she remem- bered the arms of men that had held her when ad- venture was a possible thing for her. Particularly she remembered one who had for a time been her lover and who in the moment of his passion had cried out to her more than a hundred times, saying the same words madly over and over: ""You dear! You dear! You lovely dear!"" The words, she thought, ex- pressed something she would have liked to have achieved in life. In her room in the shabby old hotel the sick wife of the hotel keeper began to weep and, putting her hands to her face, rocked back and forth. The words of her one friend, Doctor Reefy, rang in her ears. ""Love is like a wind stirring the grass beneath trees on a black night,"" he had said. ""You must not try to make love definite. It is the divine accident of life. If you try to be definite and sure about it and to live beneath the trees, where soft night winds blow, the long hot day of disappointment comes swiftly and the gritty dust from passing wagons gathers upon lips inflamed and made tender by kisses."" Elizabeth Willard could not remember her mother who had died when she was but five years old. Her girlhood had been lived in the most haphazard man- ner imaginable. Her father was a man who had wanted to be let alone and the affairs of the hotel would not let him alone. He also had lived and died a sick man. Every day he arose with a cheerful face, but by ten o'clock in the morning all the joy had gone out of his heart. When a guest complained of the fare in the hotel dining room or one of the girls who made up the beds got married and went away, he stamped on the floor and swore. At night when he went to bed he thought of his daughter growing up among the stream of people that drifted in and out of the hotel and was overcome with sadness. As the girl grew older and began to walk out in the evening with men he wanted to talk to her, but when he tried was not successful. He always forgot what he wanted to say and spent the time complain- ing of his own affairs. In her girlhood and young womanhood Elizabeth had tried to be a real adventurer in life. At eighteen life had so gripped her that she was no longer a virgin but, although she had a half dozen lovers before she married Tom Willard, she had never en- tered upon an adventure prompted by desire alone. Like all the women in the world, she wanted a real lover. Always there was something she sought blindly, passionately, some hidden wonder in life. The tall beautiful girl with the swinging stride who had walked under the trees with men was forever putting out her hand into the darkness and trying to get hold of some other hand. In all the babble of words that fell from the lips of the men with whom she adventured she was trying to find what would be for her the true word, Elizabeth had married Tom Willard, a clerk in her father's hotel, because he was at hand and wanted to marry at the time when the determination to marry came to her. For a while, like most young girls, she thought marriage would change the face of life. If there was in her mind a doubt of the out- come of the marriage with Tom she brushed it aside. Her father was ill and near death at the time and she was perplexed because of the meaningless out- come of an affair in which she had just been in- volved. Other girls of her age in Winesburg were marrying men she had always known, grocery clerks or young farmers. In the evening they walked in Main Street with their husbands and when she passed they smiled happily. She began to think that the fact of marriage might be full of some hidden significance. Young wives with whom she talked spoke softly and shyly. ""It changes things to have a man of your own,"" they said. On the evening before her marriage the perplexed girl had a talk with her father. Later she wondered if the hours alone with the sick man had not led to her decision to marry. The father talked of his life and advised the daughter to avoid being led into another such muddle. He abused Tom Willard, and that led Elizabeth to come to the clerk's defense. The sick man became excited and tried to get out of bed. When she would not let him walk about he began to complain. ""I've never been let alone,"" he said. ""Although I've worked hard I've not made the hotel pay. Even now I owe money at the bank. You'll find that out when I'm gone."" The voice of the sick man became tense with ear- nestness. Being unable to arise, he put out his hand and pulled the girl's head down beside his own. ""There's a way out,"" he whispered. ""Don't marry Tom Willard or anyone else here in Winesburg. There is eight hundred dollars in a tin box in my trunk. Take it and go away."" Again the sick man's voice became querulous. ""You've got to promise,"" he declared. ""If you won't promise not to marry, give me your word that you'll never tell Tom about the money. It is mine and if I give it to you I've the right to make that demand. Hide it away. It is to make up to you for my failure as a father. Some time it may prove to be a door, a great open door to you. Come now, I tell you I'm about to die, give me your promise.""  In Doctor Reefy's office, Elizabeth, a tired gaunt old woman at forty-one, sat in a chair near the stove and looked at the floor. By a small desk near the window sat the doctor. His hands played with a lead pencil that lay on the desk. Elizabeth talked of her life as a married woman. She became impersonal and forgot her husband, only using him as a lay figure to give point to her tale. ""And then I was married and it did not turn out at all,"" she said bitterly. ""As soon as I had gone into it I began to be afraid. Perhaps I knew too much before and then perhaps I found out too much during my first night with him. I don't remember. ""What a fool I was. When father gave me the money and tried to talk me out of the thought of marriage, I would not listen. I thought of what the girls who were married had said of it and I wanted marriage also. It wasn't Tom I wanted, it was mar- riage. When father went to sleep I leaned out of the window and thought of the life I had led. I didn't want to be a bad woman. The town was full of sto- ries about me. I even began to be afraid Tom would change his mind."" The woman's voice began to quiver with excite- ment. To Doctor Reefy, who without realizing what was happening had begun to love her, there came an odd illusion. He thought that as she talked the woman's body was changing, that she was becom- ing younger, straighter, stronger. When he could not shake off the illusion his mind gave it a profes- sional twist. ""It is good for both her body and her mind, this talking,"" he muttered. The woman began telling of an incident that had happened one afternoon a few months after her marriage. Her voice became steadier. ""In the late afternoon I went for a drive alone,"" she said. ""I had a buggy and a little grey pony I kept in Moyer's Livery. Tom was painting and repapering rooms in the hotel. He wanted money and I was trying to make up my mind to tell him about the eight hun- dred dollars father had given to me. I couldn't de- cide to do it. I didn't like him well enough. There was always paint on his hands and face during those days and he smelled of paint. He was trying to fix up the old hotel, and make it new and smart."" The excited woman sat up very straight in her chair and made a quick girlish movement with her hand as she told of the drive alone on the spring afternoon. ""It was cloudy and a storm threatened,"" she said. ""Black clouds made the green of the trees and the grass stand out so that the colors hurt my eyes. I went out Trunion Pike a mile or more and then turned into a side road. The little horse went quickly along up hill and down. I was impatient. Thoughts came and I wanted to get away from my thoughts. I began to beat the horse. The black clouds settled down and it began to rain. I wanted to go at a terrible speed, to drive on and on forever. I wanted to get out of town, out of my clothes, out of my marriage, out of my body, out of everything. I almost killed the horse, making him run, and when he could not run any more I got out of the buggy and ran afoot into the darkness until I fell and hurt my side. I wanted to run away from everything but I wanted to run towards something too. Don't you see, dear, how it was?"" Elizabeth sprang out of the chair and began to walk about in the office. She walked as Doctor Reefy thought he had never seen anyone walk before. To her whole body there was a swing, a rhythm that intoxicated him. When she came and knelt on the floor beside his chair he took her into his arms and began to kiss her passionately. ""I cried all the way home,"" she said, as she tried to continue the story of her wild ride, but he did not listen. ""You dear! You lovely dear! Oh you lovely dear!"" he muttered and thought he held in his arms not the tired-out woman of forty-one but a lovely and innocent girl who had been able by some miracle to project her- self out of the husk of the body of the tired-out woman. Doctor Reefy did not see the woman he had held in his arms again until after her death. On the sum- mer afternoon in the office when he was on the point of becoming her lover a half grotesque little incident brought his love-making quickly to an end. As the man and woman held each other tightly heavy feet came tramping up the office stairs. The two sprang to their feet and stood listening and trembling. The noise on the stairs was made by a clerk from the Paris Dry Goods Company. With a loud bang he threw an empty box on the pile of rubbish in the hallway and then went heavily down the stairs. Elizabeth followed him almost immedi- ately. The thing that had come to life in her as she talked to her one friend died suddenly. She was hysterical, as was also Doctor Reefy, and did not want to continue the talk. Along the street she went with the blood still singing in her body, but when she turned out of Main Street and saw ahead the lights of the New Willard House, she began to trem- ble and her knees shook so that for a moment she thought she would fall in the street. The sick woman spent the last few months of her life hungering for death. Along the road of death she went, seeking, hungering. She personified the figure of death and made him now a strong black- haired youth running over hills, now a stem quiet man marked and scarred by the business of living. In the darkness of her room she put out her hand, thrusting it from under the covers of her bed, and she thought that death like a living thing put out his hand to her. ""Be patient, lover,"" she whispered. ""Keep yourself young and beautiful and be patient."" On the evening when disease laid its heavy hand upon her and defeated her plans for telling her son George of the eight hundred dollars hidden away, she got out of bed and crept half across the room pleading with death for another hour of life. ""Wait, dear! The boy! The boy! The boy!"" she pleaded as she tried with all of her strength to fight off the arms of the lover she had wanted so earnestly.  Elizabeth died one day in March in the year when her son George became eighteen, and the young man had but little sense of the meaning of her death. Only time could give him that. For a month he had seen her lying white and still and speechless in her bed, and then one afternoon the doctor stopped him in the hallway and said a few words. The young man went into his own room and closed the door. He had a queer empty feeling in the region of his stomach. For a moment he sat star- ing at, the floor and then jumping up went for a walk. Along the station platform he went, and around through residence streets past the high- school building, thinking almost entirely of his own affairs. The notion of death could not get hold of him and he was in fact a little annoyed that his mother had died on that day. He had just received a note from Helen White, the daughter of the town banker, in answer to one from him. ""Tonight I could have gone to see her and now it will have to be put off,"" he thought half angrily. Elizabeth died on a Friday afternoon at three o'clock. It had been cold and rainy in the morning but in the afternoon the sun came out. Before she died she lay paralyzed for six days unable to speak or move and with only her mind and her eyes alive. For three of the six days she struggled, thinking of her boy, trying to say some few words in regard to his future, and in her eyes there was an appeal so touching that all who saw it kept the memory of the dying woman in their minds for years. Even Tom Willard, who had always half resented his wife, for- got his resentment and the tears ran out of his eyes and lodged in his mustache. The mustache had begun to turn grey and Tom colored it with dye. There was oil in the preparation he used for the purpose and the tears, catching in the mustache and being brushed away by his hand, formed a fine mist- like vapor. In his grief Tom Willard's face looked like the face of a little dog that has been out a long time in bitter weather. George came home along Main Street at dark on the day of his mother's death and, after going to his own room to brush his hair and clothes, went along the hallway and into the room where the body lay. There was a candle on the dressing table by the door and Doctor Reefy sat in a chair by the bed. The doctor arose and started to go out. He put out his hand as though to greet the younger man and then awkwardly drew it back again. The air of the room was heavy with the presence of the two self- conscious human beings, and the man hurried away. The dead woman's son sat down in a chair and looked at the floor. He again thought of his own affairs and definitely decided he would make a change in his fife, that he would leave Winesburg. ""I will go to some city. Perhaps I can get a job on some newspaper,"" he thought, and then his mind turned to the girl with whom he was to have spent this evening and again he was half angry at the turn of events that had prevented his going to her. In the dimly lighted room with the dead woman the young man began to have thoughts. His mind played with thoughts of life as his mother's mind had played with the thought of death. He closed his eyes and imagined that the red young lips of Helen White touched his own lips. His body trembled and his hands shook. And then something happened. The boy sprang to his feet and stood stiffly. He looked at the figure of the dead woman under the sheets and shame for his thoughts swept over him so that he began to weep. A new notion came into his mind and he turned and looked guiltily about as though afraid he would be observed. George Willard became possessed of a madness to lift the sheet from the body of his mother and look at her face. The thought that had come into his mind gripped him terribly. He became convinced that not his mother but someone else lay in the bed before him. The conviction was so real that it was almost unbearable. The body under the sheets was long and in death looked young and graceful. To the boy, held by some strange fancy, it was unspeakably lovely. The feeling that the body before him was alive, that in another moment a lovely woman would spring out of the bed and confront him, be- came so overpowering that he could not bear the suspense. Again and again he put out his hand. Once he touched and half lifted the white sheet that covered her, but his courage failed and he, like Doc- tor Reefy, turned and went out of the room. In the hallway outside the door he stopped and trembled so that he had to put a hand against the wall to support himself. ""That's not my mother. That's not my mother in there,"" he whispered to himself and again his body shook with fright and uncertainty. When Aunt Elizabeth Swift, who had come to watch over the body, came out of an adjoining room he put his hand into hers and began to sob, shaking his head from side to side, half blind with grief. ""My mother is dead,"" he said, and then forgetting the woman he turned and stared at the door through which he had just come. ""The dear, the dear, oh the lovely dear,"" the boy, urged by some impulse outside himself, muttered aloud. As for the eight hundred dollars the dead woman had kept hidden so long and that was to give George Willard his start in the city, it lay in the tin box behind the plaster by the foot of his mother's bed. Elizabeth had put it there a week after her mar- riage, breaking the plaster away with a stick. Then she got one of the workmen her husband was at that time employing about the hotel to mend the wall. ""I jammed the corner of the bed against it,"" she had explained to her husband, unable at the moment to give up her dream of release, the release that after all came to her but twice in her life, in the moments when her lovers Death and Doctor Reefy held her in their arms.

",Twelfth Night,"Act 2, Scene 3"," OLIVIA'S house Enter SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW  SIR TOBY. Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo surgere' thou know'st-  AGUECHEEK. Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up late.  SIR TOBY. A false conclusion! I hate it as an unfill'd can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early; so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements?  AGUECHEEK. Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.  SIR TOBY. Th'art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoup of wine.   Enter CLOWN  AGUECHEEK. Here comes the fool, i' faith.  CLOWN. How now, my hearts! Did you never see the picture of 'we three'?  SIR TOBY. Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.  AGUECHEEK. By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spok'st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; 'twas very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?  CLOWN. I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.  AGUECHEEK. Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song.  SIR TOBY. Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let's have a song.  AGUECHEEK. There's a testril of me too; if one knight give a- CLOWN. Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?  SIR TOBY. A love-song, a love-song.  AGUECHEEK. Ay, ay; I care not for good life.   CLOWN sings  O mistress mine, where are you roaming?   O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,  That can sing both high and low.  Trip no further, pretty sweeting;  Journeys end in lovers meeting,  Every wise man's son doth know.  AGUECHEEK. Excellent good, i' faith!  SIR TOBY. Good, good!   CLOWN sings   What is love? 'Tis not hereafter;  Present mirth hath present laughter;   What's to come is still unsure.  In delay there lies no plenty,  Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty;   Youth's a stuff will not endure.  AGUECHEEK. A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.  SIR TOBY. A contagious breath.  AGUECHEEK. Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.  SIR TOBY. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?  AGUECHEEK. An you love me, let's do't. I am dog at a catch.  CLOWN. By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.  AGUECHEEK. Most certain. Let our catch be 'Thou knave.'  CLOWN. 'Hold thy peace, thou knave' knight? I shall be constrain'd in't to call thee knave, knight.  AGUECHEEK. 'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'  CLOWN. I shall never begin if I hold my peace.  AGUECHEEK. Good, i' faith! Come, begin.  [Catch sung]   Enter MARIA  MARIA. What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not call'd up her steward Malvolio, and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.  SIR TOBY. My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a Peg-a-Ramsey, and   [Sings] Three merry men be we. Am not I consanguineous? Am I not of her blood? Tilly-vally, lady.  [Sings] There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady, lady.  CLOWN. Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.  AGUECHEEK. Ay, he does well enough if he be dispos'd, and so do I too; he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.  SIR TOBY. [Sings] O' the twelfth day of December-  MARIA. For the love o' God, peace!  Enter MALVOLIO  MALVOLIO. My masters, are you mad? Or what are you? Have you no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an ale-house of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time, in you?  SIR TOBY. We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!  MALVOLIO. Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you that, though she harbours you as her kins-man, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours, you are welcome to the house; if not, and it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.  SIR TOBY. [Sings] Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.  MARIA. Nay, good Sir Toby.  CLOWN. [Sings] His eyes do show his days are almost done.  MALVOLIO. Is't even so?  SIR TOBY. [Sings] But I will never die.  [Falls down]  CLOWN. [Sings] Sir Toby, there you lie.  MALVOLIO. This is much credit to you.  SIR TOBY. [Sings] Shall I bid him go?  CLOWN. [Sings] What an if you do?  SIR TOBY. [Sings] Shall I bid him go, and spare not?  CLOWN. [Sings] O, no, no, no, no, you dare not.  SIR TOBY. [Rising] Out o' tune, sir! Ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?  CLOWN. Yes, by Saint Anne; and ginger shall be hot i' th' mouth too. SIR TOBY. Th' art i' th' right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!  MALVOLIO. Mistress Mary, if you priz'd my lady's favour at anything more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule; she shall know of it, by this hand. Exit  MARIA. Go shake your ears.  AGUECHEEK. 'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's ahungry, to challenge him the field, and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.  SIR TOBY. Do't, knight. I'll write thee a challenge; or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.  MARIA. Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for to-night; since the youth of the Count's was to-day with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him; if I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it.  SIR TOBY. Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.  MARIA. Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of Puritan.  AGUECHEEK. O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog.  SIR TOBY. What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight?  AGUECHEEK. I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason good enough.  MARIA. The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser; an affection'd ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so cramm'd, as he thinks, with excellencies that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.  SIR TOBY. What wilt thou do?  MARIA. I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady, your niece; on forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands.  SIR TOBY. Excellent! I smell a device.  AGUECHEEK. I have't in my nose too.  SIR TOBY. He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she's in love with him.  MARIA. My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.  AGUECHEEK. And your horse now would make him an ass.  MARIA. Ass, I doubt not.  AGUECHEEK. O, 'twill be admirable!  MARIA. Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter; observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell. Exit  SIR TOBY. Good night, Penthesilea.  AGUECHEEK. Before me, she's a good wench.  SIR TOBY. She's a beagle true-bred, and one that adores me. What o' that?  AGUECHEEK. I was ador'd once too.  SIR TOBY. Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.  AGUECHEEK. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.  SIR TOBY. Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i' th' end, call me Cut.  AGUECHEEK. If I do not, never trust me; take it how you will.  SIR TOBY. Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight; come, knight.    Exeunt "
Wuthering Heights: Novel Summary: Chapters 7-8," Mrs. Dean cleans Heathcliff up and encourages him to show his good humor to everyone, but just then Hindley comes in and pushes him out, saying that he will not see their guests. Edgar comes into the kitchen and remarks about Heathcliff's long hair, and Heathcliff throws hot applesauce in his face. Isabella and Catherine come running, and Heathcliff is locked away. The party soon has dinner, but Cathy cannot eat, thinking about Heathcliff. Later in the evening a traveling band comes to the house, and this gives Cathy the chance to go and see Heathcliff. She and Nelly get him out and to the kitchen, and he says that he is thinking of a way to get back at Hindley.  One day Catherine comes to talk to Ellen. Mr. Hindley has gone from the house, and Heathcliff has given himself the day off. Edgar is to come by, and Heathcliff is angry because she spends more time with Edgar than him. Heathcliff leaves the house. When Edgar arrives, Cathy gets irritated at Ellen because she will not leave the room (Hindley had told her not to let Edgar and Cathy be alone together). She pinches Ellen, and when Ellen gets mad, she denies that she did it. She then slaps Ellen's face. By this time young Hareton is crying, and Cathy picks him up to shake him. Edgar tries to get him away from her, and she slaps him. Edgar is quite angry and means to leave the house and Cathy, but he cannot. Even though she lied and she hit him, he goes back to her. Later Hindley comes home drunk, and Edgar leaves. ‹ NovelGuide: : Novel :  up NovelGuide: : Novel : 0 › ",Wuthering Heights,Chapters 7-8,"  CATHY stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas. By that time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved. The mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver, and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands that she might sail in. Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming delightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty! I should scarcely have known you: you look like a lady now. Isabella Linton is not to be compared with her, is she, Frances?' 'Isabella has not her natural advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again here. Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things - Stay, dear, you will disarrange your curls - let me untie your hat.' I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments. She kissed me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff. Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping to succeed in separating the two friends. Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first. If he were careless, and uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so since. Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy, and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom have a natural pleasure in soap and water. Therefore, not to mention his clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally beclouded. He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed counterpart of himself, as he expected. 'Is Heathcliff not here?' she demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors. 'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he would be compelled to present himself. 'You may come and wish Miss Catherine welcome, like the other servants.' Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how - how funny and grim! But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton. Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?' She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable. 'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a way, that is permitted.' 'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it!' And he would have broken from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again. 'I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself: Heathcliff, shake hands at least! What are you sulky for? It was only that you looked odd. If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will be all right: but you are so dirty!' She gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also at her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its contact with his. 'You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and snatching away his hand. 'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to be dirty, and I will be dirty.' With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an exhibition of bad temper. After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires, befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs. He had retired to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness. They had invited them to spend the morrow at  , and the invitation had been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.' Under these circumstances I remained solitary. I smelt the rich scent of the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless purity of my particular care - the scoured and well-swept floor. I gave due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass, and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind to crying. It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them: I got up and walked into the court to seek him. He was not far; I found him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding the other beasts, according to custom. 'Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and Joseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss Cathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to yourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.' He proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me. 'Come - are you coming?' I continued. 'There's a little cake for each of you, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.' I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him. Catherine supped with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other. His cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies. He managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and dour to his chamber. Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen once to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask what was the matter with him, and then went back. In the morning he rose early; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors; not re-appearing till the family were departed for church. Fasting and reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit. He hung about me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed abruptly - 'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.' 'High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you HAVE grieved Catherine: she's sorry she ever came home, I daresay! It looks as if you envied her, because she is more thought of than you.' The notion of ENVYING Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough. 'Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious. 'She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.' 'Well, I cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry than she.' 'Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an Back to Full Books byEmily Bronte empty stomach,' said I. 'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves. But, if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she comes in. You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say - you know best what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted into a stranger by her grand dress. And now, though I have dinner to get ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look quite a doll beside you: and that he does. You are younger, and yet, I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders; you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?' Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and he sighed. 'But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him less handsome or me more so. I wish I had light hair and a fair skin, and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as he will be!' 'And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of rain. Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit! Come to the glass, and I'll let you see what you should wish. Do you mark those two lines between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched, sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried, who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like devil's spies? Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to raise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent angels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where they are not sure of foes. Don't get the expression of a vicious cur that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.' 'In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even forehead,' he replied. 'I do - and that won't help me to them.' 'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into something worse than ugly. And now that we've done washing, and combing, and sulking - tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome? I'll tell you, I do. You're fit for a prince in disguise. Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each of them able to buy up, with one week's income,   and Thrushcross Grange together? And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England. Were I in your place, I would frame high notions of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!' So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court. He ran to the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in winter. Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour into their white faces. I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other. They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or, perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the room - send him into the garret till dinner is over. He'll be cramming his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them a minute.' 'Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he: and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.' 'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till dark,' cried Hindley. 'Begone, you vagabond! What! you are attempting the coxcomb, are you? Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks - see if I won't pull them a bit longer!' 'They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the doorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache. It's like a colt's mane over his eyes!' He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival. He seized a tureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his gripe) and dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the place. Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to his chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless. I got the dishcloth, and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it served him right for meddling. His sister began weeping to go home, and Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all. 'You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton. 'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be flogged: I hate him to be flogged! I can't eat my dinner. Why did you speak to him, Edgar?' 'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the remainder of the purification with his cambric pocket- handkerchief. 'I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.' 'Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously; 'you're not killed. Don't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet! Hush, Isabella! Has anybody hurt you?' 'There, there, children - to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling in. 'That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely. Next time, Master Edgar, take the law into your own fists - it will give you an appetite!' The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast. They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real harm had befallen them. Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the mistress made them merry with lively talk. I waited behind her chair, and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air, commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her. 'An unfeeling child,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old playmate's troubles. I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.' She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks flushed, and the tears gushed over them. She slipped her fork to the floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion. I did not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private mess of victuals. In the evening we had a dance. Cathy begged that he might be liberated then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I was appointed to supply the deficiency. We got rid of all gloom in the excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone, clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers. They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to hear them. After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs and glees. Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty. Catherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of the steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house door below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made no stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where Heathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined answering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold communion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse unmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the singers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn her. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The little monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof, into the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I could coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her, and she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my fellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound of our 'devil's psalmody,' as it pleased him to call it. I told them I intended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had never broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his cheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and could eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He leant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands and remained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his thoughts, he answered gravely - 'I'm trying to settle how I shall pay Hindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last. I hope he will not die before I do!' 'For shame, Heathcliff!' said I. 'It is for God to punish wicked people; we should learn to forgive.' 'No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned. 'I only wish I knew the best way! Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm thinking of that I don't feel pain.' 'But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you. I'm annoyed how I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold, and you nodding for bed! I could have told Heathcliff's history, all that you need hear, in half a dozen words.'  Thus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay aside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I was very far from nodding. 'Sit still, Mrs. Dean,' I cried; 'do sit still another half-hour. You've done just right to tell the story leisurely. That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same style. I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or less.' 'The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.' 'No matter - I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours. One or two is early enough for a person who lies till ten.' 'You shouldn't lie till ten. There's the very prime of the morning gone long before that time. A person who has not done one-half his day's work by ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.' 'Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend lengthening the night till afternoon. I prognosticate for myself an obstinate cold, at least.' 'I hope not, sir. Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years; during that space Mrs. Earnshaw - ' 'No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort! Are you acquainted with the mood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its kitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently that puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?' 'A terribly lazy mood, I should say.' 'On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and, therefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions acquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does over a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the deepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the looker-on. They DO live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less in surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love for life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love of a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a single dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it justice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks: he can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part is a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.' 'Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,' observed Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech. 'Excuse me,' I responded; 'you, my good friend, are a striking evidence against that assertion. Excepting a few provincialisms of slight consequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to consider as peculiar to your class. I am sure you have thought a great deal more than the generality of servants think. You have been compelled to cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for frittering your life away in silly trifles.' Mrs. Dean laughed. 'I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' she said; 'not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and one series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have undergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have read more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood. You could not open a book in this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of also: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and those I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor man's daughter. However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's fashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will be content to pass to the next summer - the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty-three years ago.'  CHAPTER VIII  ON the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the last of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born. We were busy with the hay in a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling me as she ran. 'Oh, such a grand bairn!' she panted out. 'The finest lad that ever breathed! But the doctor says missis must go: he says she's been in a consumption these many months. I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter. You must come home directly. You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and milk, and take care of it day and night. I wish I were you, because it will be all yours when there is no missis!' 'But is she very ill?' I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet. 'I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man. She's out of her head for joy, it's such a beauty! If I were her I'm certain I should not die: I should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth. I was fairly mad at him. Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the house, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps forward, and says he - ""Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son. When she came, I felt convinced we shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will probably finish her. Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't be helped. And besides, you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass!""' 'And what did the master answer?' I inquired. 'I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the bairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously. I, as zealous as herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very sad for Hindley's sake. He had room in his heart only for two idols - his wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't conceive how he would bear the loss. When we got to  , there he stood at the front door; and, as I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby?' 'Nearly ready to run about, Nell!' he replied, putting on a cheerful smile. 'And the mistress?' I ventured to inquire; 'the doctor says she's - ' 'Damn the doctor!' he interrupted, reddening. 'Frances is quite right: she'll be perfectly well by this time next week. Are you going up-stairs? will you tell her that I'll come, if she'll promise not to talk. I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she must - tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.' I delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits, and replied merrily, 'I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone out twice, crying. Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not bind me not to laugh at him!' Poor soul! Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her health improved every day. When Kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to further expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not - she's well - she does not want any more attendance from you! She never was in a consumption. It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as mine now, and her cheek as cool.' He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her - a very slight one - he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about his neck, her face changed, and she was dead. As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands. Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was contented, as far as regarded him. For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither wept nor prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay. I had not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would. Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove. The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for Catherine and Heathcliff. His treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint. And, truly, it appeared as if the lad WERE possessed of something diabolical at that period. He delighted to witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity. I could not half tell what an infernal house we had. The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might be an exception. At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature! I own I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me, though. She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression. He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace. It used to hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers has been removed, or else you might see something of what she was. Can you make that out? Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light hair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost too graceful. I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual. I marvelled much how he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of Catherine Earnshaw. 'A very agreeable portrait,' I observed to the house-keeper. 'Is it like?' 'Yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is his everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.' Catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her five-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality; gained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her brother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first - for she was full of ambition - and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard Heathcliff termed a 'vulgar young ruffian,' and 'worse than a brute,' she took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise. Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit   openly. He had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him; and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he could not be gracious, kept out of the way. I rather think his appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her. I've had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery. That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened into more humility. She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser. Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it. He had reached the age of sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of. In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and any love for books or learning. His childhood's sense of superiority, instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away. He struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely; and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former level. Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration: he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance. Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words, and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him. On the before-named occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and was then preparing to receive him. 'Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff. 'Are you going anywhere?' 'No, it is raining,' she answered. 'Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said. 'Nobody coming here, I hope?' 'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but you should be in the field now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were gone.' 'Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the boy. 'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.' 'Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!' 'Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will take him till dark, and he'll never know.' So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine reflected an instant, with knitted brows - she found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion. 'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence. 'As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for no good.' 'Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours! I'm on the point, sometimes, of complaining that they - but I'll not - ' 'That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled countenance. 'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl! That's enough; let me alone. What are you on the point of complaining about, Heathcliff?' 'Nothing - only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with me. Do you see? I've marked every day.' 'Yes - very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish tone. 'And where is the sense of that?' 'To show that I DO take notice,' said Heathcliff. 'And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more irritated. 'What good do I get? What do you talk about? You might be dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you do, either!' 'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked my company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation. 'It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she muttered. Her companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summon she had received. Doubtless Catherine marked the difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out. The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect. He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and softer. 'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser. 'No,' answered Catherine. 'What are you doing there, Nelly?' 'My work, Miss,' I replied. (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.) She stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'Take yourself and your dusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are!' 'It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence. I'm sure Mr. Edgar will excuse me.' 'I hate you to be fidgeting in MY presence,' exclaimed the young lady imperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff. 'I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded assiduously with my occupation. She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand, and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm. I've said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees, and screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick! You have no right to nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.' 'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage. She never had power to conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze. 'What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to refute her. She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water. 'Catherine, love! Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed. 'Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over. Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out complaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which drew her fury on to his unlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child waxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him. In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest. He drew back in consternation. I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked off to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for I was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement. The insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and with a quivering lip. 'That's right!' I said to myself. 'Take warning and begone! It's a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.' 'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door. He swerved aside, and attempted to pass. 'You must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically. 'I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice. 'No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit down; you shall not leave me in that temper. I should be miserable all night, and I won't be miserable for you!' 'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Linton. Catherine was mute. 'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'I'll not come here again!' Her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle. 'And you told a deliberate untruth!' he said. 'I didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'I did nothing deliberately. Well, go, if you please - get away! And now I'll cry - I'll cry myself sick!' She dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious earnest. Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there he lingered. I resolved to encourage him. 'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' I called out. 'As bad as any marred child: you'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to grieve us.' The soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed, or a bird half eaten. Ah, I thought, there will be no saving him: he's doomed, and flies to his fate! And so it was: he turned abruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and when I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home rabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary frame of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy - had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess themselves lovers. Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse, and Catherine to her chamber. I went to hide little Hareton, and to take the shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the plan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun.  "
Notes from the Underground: Novel Summary: Part 1 Chapter 7-Part 1 Chapter 8," The UM more clearly focuses his assault on Chernyshevsky's ""golden dreams"" in this chapter, where he asserts that man is an inherently irrational creature (he cites human history, including the American Civil War, which was in progress during the time he was writing), and therefore does not always act in his own self-interest.  Indeed, the Underground Man asks, ""And what if it turns out that man's advantage sometimes not only may, but even must in certain circumstances, consist precisely in his desiring something harmful to himself instead of something advantageous?"" Freedom to act against the laws of nature, against the crystal palace of reason, is the advantage the UM sees above all others.  The UM goes on: ""Man needs only one thing-his own independentdesire, whatever that independence might cost and wherever it might lead."" Next, he confronts the counter-argument that man's ""free will"" is just an illusion-just a scientific formula of biological chemicals.  The UM says that if this were ever the case, man would cease being human altogether and become an organ stop.  Later, he even suggests that this liberty of choice, this freedom to be stupid, is a right. ",Notes from the Underground,Part 1 Chapter 7-Part 1 Chapter 8,"    But these are all golden dreams. Oh, tell me, who was it first announced, who was it first proclaimed, that man only does nasty things because he does not know his own interests; and that if he were enlightened, if his eyes were opened to his real normal interests, man would at once cease to do nasty things, would at once become good and noble because, being enlightened and understanding his real advantage, he would see his own advantage in the good and nothing else, and we all know that not one man can, consciously, act against his own interests, consequently, so to say, through necessity, he would begin doing good? Oh, the babe! Oh, the pure, innocent child! Why, in the first place, when in all these thousands of years has there been a time when man has acted only from his own interest? What is to be done with the millions of facts that bear witness that men, CONSCIOUSLY, that is fully understanding their real interests, have left them in the background and have rushed headlong on another path, to meet peril and danger, compelled to this course by nobody and by nothing, but, as it were, simply disliking the beaten track, and have obstinately, wilfully, struck out another difficult, absurd way, seeking it almost in the darkness. So, I suppose, this obstinacy and perversity were pleasanter to them than any advantage. ... Advantage! What is advantage? And will you take it upon yourself to define with perfect accuracy in what the advantage of man consists? And what if it so happens that a man's advantage, SOMETIMES, not only may, but even must, consist in his desiring in certain cases what is harmful to himself and not advantageous. And if so, if there can be such a case, the whole principle falls into dust. What do you think--are there such cases? You laugh; laugh away, gentlemen, but only answer me: have man's advantages been reckoned up with perfect certainty? Are there not some which not only have not been included but cannot possibly be included under any classification? You see, you gentlemen have, to the best of my knowledge, taken your whole register of human advantages from the averages of statistical figures and politico-economical formulas. Your advantages are prosperity, wealth, freedom, peace--and so on, and so on. So that the man who should, for instance, go openly and knowingly in opposition to all that list would to your thinking, and indeed mine, too, of course, be an obscurantist or an absolute madman: would not he? But, you know, this is what is surprising: why does it so happen that all these statisticians, sages and lovers of humanity, when they reckon up human advantages invariably leave out one? They don't even take it into their reckoning in the form in which it should be taken, and the whole reckoning depends upon that. It would be no greater matter, they would simply have to take it, this advantage, and add it to the list. But the trouble is, that this strange advantage does not fall under any classification and is not in place in any list. I have a friend for instance ... Ech! gentlemen, but of course he is your friend, too; and indeed there is no one, no one to whom he is not a friend! When he prepares for any undertaking this gentleman immediately explains to you, elegantly and clearly, exactly how he must act in accordance with the laws of reason and truth. What is more, he will talk to you with excitement and passion of the true normal interests of man; with irony he will upbraid the short- sighted fools who do not understand their own interests, nor the true significance of virtue; and, within a quarter of an hour, without any sudden outside provocation, but simply through something inside him which is stronger than all his interests, he will go off on quite a different tack--that is, act in direct opposition to what he has just been saying about himself, in opposition to the laws of reason, in opposition to his own advantage, in fact in opposition to everything ... I warn you that my friend is a compound personality and therefore it is difficult to blame him as an individual. The fact is, gentlemen, it seems there must really exist something that is dearer to almost every man than his greatest advantages, or (not to be illogical) there is a most advantageous advantage (the very one omitted of which we spoke just now) which is more important and more advantageous than all other advantages, for the sake of which a man if necessary is ready to act in opposition to all laws; that is, in opposition to reason, honour, peace, prosperity--in fact, in opposition to all those excellent and useful things if only he can attain that fundamental, most advantageous advantage which is dearer to him than all. ""Yes, but it's advantage all the same,"" you will retort. But excuse me, I'll make the point clear, and it is not a case of playing upon words. What matters is, that this advantage is remarkable from the very fact that it breaks down all our classifications, and continually shatters every system constructed by lovers of mankind for the benefit of mankind. In fact, it upsets everything. But before I mention this advantage to you, I want to compromise myself personally, and therefore I boldly declare that all these fine systems, all these theories for explaining to mankind their real normal interests, in order that inevitably striving to pursue these interests they may at once become good and noble--are, in my opinion, so far, mere logical exercises! Yes, logical exercises. Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare. Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic. I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne. Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived. Take Napoleon--the Great and also the present one. Take North America--the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein .... And what is it that civilisation softens in us? The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations--and absolutely nothing more. And through the development of this many- sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed. In fact, this has already happened to him. Have you noticed that it is the most civilised gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us. In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty. In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper. Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse? Decide that for yourselves. They say that Cleopatra (excuse an instance from Roman history) was fond of sticking gold pins into her slave-girls' breasts and derived gratification from their screams and writhings. You will say that that was in the comparatively barbarous times; that these are barbarous times too, because also, comparatively speaking, pins are stuck in even now; that though man has now learned to see more clearly than in barbarous ages, he is still far from having learnt to act as reason and science would dictate. But yet you are fully convinced that he will be sure to learn when he gets rid of certain old bad habits, and when common sense and science have completely re-educated human nature and turned it in a normal direction. You are confident that then man will cease from INTENTIONAL error and will, so to say, be compelled not to want to set his will against his normal interests. That is not all; then, you say, science itself will teach man (though to my mind it's a superfluous luxury) that he never has really had any caprice or will of his own, and that he himself is something of the nature of a piano-key or the stop of an organ, and that there are, besides, things called the laws of nature; so that everything he does is not done by his willing it, but is done of itself, by the laws of nature. Consequently we have only to discover these laws of nature, and man will no longer have to answer for his actions and life will become exceedingly easy for him. All human actions will then, of course, be tabulated according to these laws, mathematically, like tables of logarithms up to 108,000, and entered in an index; or, better still, there would be published certain edifying works of the nature of encyclopaedic lexicons, in which everything will be so clearly calculated and explained that there will be no more incidents or adventures in the world. Then--this is all what you say--new economic relations will be established, all ready-made and worked out with mathematical exactitude, so that every possible question will vanish in the twinkling of an eye, simply because every possible answer to it will be provided. Then the ""Palace of Crystal"" will be built. Then ... In fact, those will be halcyon days. Of course there is no guaranteeing (this is my comment) that it will not be, for instance, frightfully dull then (for what will one have to do when everything will be calculated and tabulated), but on the other hand everything will be extraordinarily rational. Of course boredom may lead you to anything. It is boredom sets one sticking golden pins into people, but all that would not matter. What is bad (this is my comment again) is that I dare say people will be thankful for the gold pins then. Man is stupid, you know, phenomenally stupid; or rather he is not at all stupid, but he is so ungrateful that you could not find another like him in all creation. I, for instance, would not be in the least surprised if all of a sudden, A PROPOS of nothing, in the midst of general prosperity a gentleman with an ignoble, or rather with a reactionary and ironical, countenance were to arise and, putting his arms akimbo, say to us all: ""I say, gentleman, hadn't we better kick over the whole show and scatter rationalism to the winds, simply to send these logarithms to the devil, and to enable us to live once more at our own sweet foolish will!"" That again would not matter, but what is annoying is that he would be sure to find followers--such is the nature of man. And all that for the most foolish reason, which, one would think, was hardly worth mentioning: that is, that man everywhere and at all times, whoever he may be, has preferred to act as he chose and not in the least as his reason and advantage dictated. And one may choose what is contrary to one's own interests, and sometimes one POSITIVELY OUGHT (that is my idea). One's own free unfettered choice, one's own caprice, however wild it may be, one's own fancy worked up at times to frenzy--is that very ""most advantageous advantage"" which we have overlooked, which comes under no classification and against which all systems and theories are continually being shattered to atoms. And how do these wiseacres know that man wants a normal, a virtuous choice? What has made them conceive that man must want a rationally advantageous choice? What man wants is simply INDEPENDENT choice, whatever that independence may cost and wherever it may lead. And choice, of course, the devil only knows what choice.  "
Oliver Twist: Novel Summary: Chapters28-30," As they ran through the fields, Sikes had tried to bring Oliver with him.  After Toby abandoned them however, it became impossible and stays alive at the same time, so he wrapped his shawl around Oliver's wound and left him in the field.  Then, diverting the attention of the pursuers to him and not Oliver, he fired his pistol and ran.  The butler of the house, Mr. Giles, a houseboy who was around the age of thirty, Brittles, and a tinker who was sleeping in the shed were the ones pursuing.  But hearing the gunshot, they soon gave up on their chase and went back to the house.  The next morning the three sat telling the tale of the robbery to the cook and the maid.  While this was going on, Oliver woke up alone in the field, with his hurt throbbing.  He realized that he had to get help or he would die alone in the field.  He wandered to the house they had tried to rob, and knocked on the door.  He collapsed, and the men telling the story, along with the women listening answered the door to find him there.  They called one of the mistresses of the house and she decided to take care of him, after speaking with her aunt.   Giles, dressed in his butler attire, was serving breakfast to the two ladies of the house.  The elder, Mrs. Maylie was the aunt of the beautiful young girl, Rose.  He tells them a bit about shooting Oliver, for which he was praised, but waits to tell the whole tale until after Dr. Losberne could attend.  When the doctor arrived he looked to Oliver and after a time reported to the ladies.  He invited them up to see the thief and they accepted; not knowing that Oliver was so young.   The doctor brought them into the room, and when Rose saw Oliver she sat at his side and wept on his face lamenting that one so young and innocent looking could not be evil.  She pleaded with the doctor and her aunt to not do harm to Oliver, or put him in prison.  They agreed that nothing would be decided about what to do with him, until he woke up and they could judge if he had an evil character.  Hours later, Oliver woke and grateful that he was being taken care of, told them the story of his upbringing.  The listeners of the tale were in tears, and when he was finished, he quickly fell back to sleep.  They left the room and went down to the kitchen to question Mr. Giles to make certain that Oliver was the boy he shot that night in the cellar.  Both Giles and Brittles could not give their oaths that Oliver was the boy they saw, and as they were concluding the interview, someone came to the door.  They were horrified to find out it was the Bow Street Runners there to investigate the break in.

Wuthering Heights: Novel Summary: Chapters 27-28," Catherine tells Heathcliff that her father will be miserable if she does not return, and asks him to send Ellen to the Grange so he will know that she is safe. He refuses. She also offers to marry Linton now so that she may return, but he again refuses. Soon it grows dark and servants come from the Grange looking for the two, but they are sent away. Neither sleep that night, and in the morning, Heathcliff comes for Catherine, leaving Ellen locked in the housekeeper's room. Hours later Hareton comes to bring Ellen food, but he will not help her. Ellen is locked in the room for five nights and four days.  All are happy to see her when she arrives, and she goes to tell Mr. Linton that Catherine will be coming. He finds it best to change his will so that Catherine will get his property and Heathcliff will not, and sends for his lawyer, Mr. Green. Ellen sends four men to  to get Catherine. The lawyer sends word that he cannot come now, but will soon come, and the four men return saying that Heathcliff had told them that Catherine was too ill to be moved. Ellen scolds them for their stupidity, and resolves to go there at daylight. The next morning Catherine herself comes. She goes to her father, and he soon dies blissfully and quietly with her. The lawyer finally comes after going to  for his instructions. He had been bought off by Heathcliff and so did not arrive in time for Edgar to change his will. Mr. Green fires all of the servants except Ellen. Catherine tells Ellen that Linton finally helped her because she was so full of anguish. He let her out of her room, and she went into her mother's old room and crawled out the window. ‹ NovelGuide: : Novel : 6 up NovelGuide: : Novel : 0 › ",Wuthering Heights,Chapters 27-28,"  SEVEN days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state. The havoc that months had previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her father stopped a short time daily - the brief period he could bear to sit up - and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death. He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account. We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine's face was just like the landscape - shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that passing forgetfulness of its cares. We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before. My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together. Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like fear. 'It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty. 'Is not your father very ill? I thought you wouldn't come.' 'WHY won't you be candid?' cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting. 'Why cannot you say at once you don't want me? It is strange, Linton, that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!' Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but his cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical behaviour. 'My father IS very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his bedside? Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you wished I wouldn't keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance attendance on your affectations now!' 'My affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they? For heaven's sake, Catherine, don't look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.' 'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion. 'Foolish, silly boy! And there! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him! You needn't bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from the hearth-stone, and pretending - what do we pretend? Let go my frock! If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise, and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile - DON'T!' With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite terror. 'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be killed! DEAR Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you. You'll not go, then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you WILL consent - and he'll let me die with you!' My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him. The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she grew thoroughly moved and alarmed. 'Consent to what?' she asked. 'To stay! tell me the meaning of this strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your heart. You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn't let any enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I'll believe you are a coward, for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.' 'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated fingers, 'and I dread him - I dread him! I DARE not tell!' 'Oh, well!' said Catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret: I'M no coward. Save yourself: I'm not afraid!' Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when, hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn't cast a glance towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he said - 'It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone, 'that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his illness?' 'No; my master is dying,' I replied: 'it is true enough. A sad thing it will be for us all, but a blessing for him!' 'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked. 'I don't know,' I said. 'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed under his eye - Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account - 'because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game long? I DID give him some lessons about snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?' 'Lively? no - he has shown the greatest distress,' I answered. 'To see him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.' 'He shall be, in a day or two,' muttered Heathcliff. 'But first - get up, Linton! Get up!' he shouted. 'Don't grovel on the ground there up, this moment!' Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear, caused by his father's glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a ridge of turf. 'Now,' said he, with curbed ferocity, 'I'm getting angry and if you don't command that paltry spirit of yours - DAMN you! get up directly!' 'I will, father,' he panted. 'Only, let me alone, or I shall faint. I've done as you wished, I'm sure. Catherine will tell you that I - that I - have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.' 'Take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet. There now - she'll lend you her arm: that's right, look at her. You would imagine I was the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.' 'Linton dear!' whispered Catherine, 'I can't go to  : papa has forbidden me. He'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?' 'I can never re-enter that house,' he answered. 'I'm NOT to re- enter it without you!' 'Stop!' cried his father. 'We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples. Nelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor, without delay.' 'You'll do well,' replied I. 'But I must remain with my mistress: to mind your son is not my business.' 'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know that: but you'll force me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity. Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?' He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial. However I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy. We reached the threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed - 'My house is not stricken with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me to shut the door.' He shut and locked it also. I started. 'You shall have tea before you go home,' he added. 'I am by myself. Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton, take your seat by HIM. I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I mean. How she does stare! It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those two, as an evening's amusement.' He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'By hell! I hate them.' 'I am not afraid of you!' exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing with passion and resolution. 'Give me that key: I will have it!' she said. 'I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.' Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he recovered it speedily. 'Now, Catherine Linton,' he said, 'stand off, or I shall knock you down; and, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.' Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents again. 'We will go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment. Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.' At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. 'You villain!' I began to cry, 'you villain!' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered. 'I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly, as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the floor. 'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall be your father, to-morrow - all the father you'll have in a few days - and you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you're no weakling: you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your eyes again!' Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff, perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and handed me a cup. 'Wash away your spleen,' he said. 'And help your own naughty pet and mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I'm going out to seek your horses.' Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the windows - they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure. 'Master Linton,' I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box your ears, as he has done your cousin's.' 'Yes, Linton, you must tell,' said Catherine. 'It was for your sake I came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.' 'Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,' he answered. 'Mrs. Dean, go away. I don't like you standing over me. Now, Catherine, you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won't drink that. Give me another.' Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer in terror for himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as ever he entered  ; so I guessed he had been menaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears. 'Papa wants us to be married,' he continued, after sipping some of the liquid. 'And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning, and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you shall return home next day, and take me with you.' 'Take you with her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed. 'YOU marry? Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the notion that anybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly puling tricks: and - don't look so silly, now! I've a very good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile conceit.' I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked me. 'Stay all night? No,' she said, looking slowly round. 'Ellen, I'll burn that door down but I'll get out.' And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his two feeble arms sobbing:- 'Won't you have me, and save me? not let me come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave, after all. You MUST obey my father - you MUST!' 'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He'll be distressed already. I'll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet! You're in no danger; but if you hinder me - Linton, I love papa better than you!' The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored to the boy his coward's eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn, persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus occupied, our jailor re- entered. 'Your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and - now Linton! snivelling again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come - have done, and get to bed. In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You're pining for pure love, are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There, to bed! Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush! hold your noise! Once in your own room, I'll not come near you: you needn't fear. By chance, you've managed tolerably. I'll look to the rest.' He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness, but he scowled on her and muttered - 'Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your courage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!' 'I AM afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if I stay, papa will be miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable - when he - when he - Mr. Heathcliff, let ME go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do what I'll willingly do of myself?' 'Let him dare to force you,' I cried. 'There's law in the land, thank God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I'd inform if he were my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!' 'Silence!' said the ruffian. 'To the devil with your clamour! I don't want YOU to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton, I'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till it is fulfilled.' 'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine, weeping bitterly. 'Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he'll think we're lost. What shall we do?' 'Not he! He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a little amusement,' answered Heathcliff. 'You cannot deny that you entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man ONLY your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as HE went out of it. I'd join him. I don't love you! How should I? Weep away. As far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind - that's paternal. But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself. Linton can play the little tyrant well. He'll undertake to torture any number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You'll be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his KINDNESS, when you get home again, I assure you.' 'You're right there!' I said; 'explain your son's character. Show his resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice before she takes the cockatrice!' 'I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,' he answered; 'because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have an opportunity of judging!' 'I'll not retract my word,' said Catherine. 'I'll marry him within this hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff, you're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from MERE malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live? I've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and I'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me! No, don't turn away! DO LOOK! you'll see nothing to provoke you. I don't hate you. I'm not angry that you struck me. Have you never loved ANYBODY in all your life, uncle? NEVER? Ah! you must look once. I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.' 'Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!' cried Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. 'I'd rather be hugged by a snake. How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I DETEST you!' He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was growing dark - we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host hurried out instantly: HE had his wits about him; WE had not. There was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone. 'I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,' I observed to Catherine. 'I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?' 'It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,' said Heathcliff, overhearing me. 'You should have opened a lattice and called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't. She's glad to be obliged to stay, I'm certain.' At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock. Then he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight. The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I. At seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She ran to the door immediately, and answered, 'Yes.' 'Here, then,' he said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned the lock again. I demanded my release. 'Be patient,' he replied; 'I'll send up your breakfast in a while.' I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's. 'I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' door!' Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me all day. 'Tak' it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand. 'Stay one minute,' I began. 'Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour forth to detain him. And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained, altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving his sense of justice or compassion.  "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 4," Dante wakes up and finds himself ""on the brink of the abysmal valley of pain"" (lines 7-8). So pitiful are the wailings that rise from that dark valley that Virgil's face is pale with pity, and Dante takes it for fear and hesitates again. But Virgil explains, and they enter  Circle, also called Limbo. Here there are only sighs, no wailing, and the only suffering, says Virgil, who dwells in this circle, is that ""without hope, we live in desire"" (line 42); all the souls here were virtuous, or at least free of sin, but they were never brought into the Christian Church through baptism, either because they lived before Christianity like Virgil, or because the teachings of Christianity never reached them, or because they died before they could be baptized. Dante is full of grief at hearing this. Has no one ever escaped this circle? Virgil answers that a great conqueror came here shortly after Virgil died and set free Adam, Noah, Moses, and many others. Virgil and Dante then come to an area full of light, where those dwell who have won honorable fame and are therefore favored by Heaven. Virgil is welcomed back to this place, which is his home, by the shades of Homer and three other great poets, and all five accept Dante as one of themselves. They walk on to a noble castle, inside of which is a fresh green meadow, and there Dante sees many men and women of Greece and Rome famous for their deeds, as well as the great Muslim leader Saladin, and then the great philosophers of the ancient world, as well as the two Muslim thinkers Avicenna and Averroes, who transmitted much ancient wisdom (including deeper insight into the philosophy of Aristotle) to western Europe. Finally Virgil and Dante leave, and he comes out of that quiet and bright place ""to a part where there is no light"" (line 141). Analysis It has seemed strange to many that the noble souls and the innocent infants in  Circle must be imagined as having crossed Acheron, along with those sinners who blamed everyone else for their misery. In the Paradiso, Dante the pilgrim gets to ask some questions he's been brooding about, and one of them is how it can be right for virtuous people to be denied the chance to get to Heaven just because they lacked baptism. So we know the question troubled him, and perhaps that trouble is reflected here. One interpretation is that Dante believed it was possible to be virtuous without being able to conceive of God as Universal Love, and that in fact only Christ could reveal that truth. What we cannot know, we cannot choose, and in life after death as Dante conceived of it, people have what they chose while alive. And if we consider the allegorical meaning, the nature of Limbo makes clear that to live even a good and honorable life without knowledge of the true nature of ultimate reality as love and bliss is to live without joy, desiring something more but having no hope of getting it. The story Virgil tells of a mighty one carrying away souls from Hell reflects the medieval belief that when Christ ""descended into Hell,"" as the Apostle's Creed states, he ""harrowed"" Hell, defeating Satan and freeing all those who had believed in Christ before his birth. Clearly, Dante reverenced all those he here depicts as dwelling in the noble castle, and he is pictured here as honored to be treated as an equal by the five great classical poets. Dante saw himself as restoring poetry to the high level of the achievements of Greece and Rome, and he announces his role here. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 4," 1. Dante is borne across the river Acheron in his sleep, he does not tell us how, and awakes on the brink of ""the dolorous valley of the abyss."" He now enters the First Circle of the Inferno; the Limbo of the Unbaptized, the border land, as the name denotes. Frate Alberico in {paragraph} 2 of his Vision says, that the divine punishments are tempered to extreme youth and old age. ""Man is first a little child, then grows and reaches adolescence, and attains to youthful vigor; and, little by little growing weaker, declines into old age; and at every step of life the sum of his sins increases. So likewise the little children are punished least, and more and more the adolescents and the youths; until, their sins decreasing with the long-continued torments, punishment also begins to decrease, as if by a kind of old age (""veluti quadam senectute "")."" 10 . Frate Alberico, in {paragraph} 9: ""The darkness was so dense and impenetrable that it was impossible to see anything there."" 28 . Mental, not physical pain; what the French theologians call "" la peine du dam"", the privation of the sight of God. 30. Virgil, ""Aeneid"", VI.: ""Forthwith are heard voices, loud wailings, and weeping ghosts of infants, in the first opening of the gate; whom, bereaved of sweet life out of the course of nature, and snatched from the breast, a black day cut off, and buried in an untimely grave."" 53. The descent of Christ into Limbo. Neither here nor elsewhere in the Inferno does Dante mention the name of Christ. 72. The reader will not fail to observe how Dante makes the word ""honor"", in its various forms, ring and reverberate through these lines, -- "" orrevol, onori, orranza, onrata, onorata""! 86. Dante puts the sword into the hand of Homer as a symbol of his warlike epic, which is a Song of the Sword. 93. Upon this line Boccaccio, ""Comento"", says: ""A proper thing it is to honor every man, but especially those who are of one and the same profession, as these were with Virgil. "" 100. Another assertion of Dante's consciousness of his own power as a poet. 106. This is the Noble Castle of human wit and learning, encircled with its seven scholastic walls, the "" Trivium"", Logic, Grammar, Rhetoric, and the ""Quadrivium "", Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry, Music. The fair rivulet is Eloquence, which Dante does not seem to consider a very profound matter, as he and Virgil pass over it as if it were dry ground. 118 . Of this word ""enamel"" Mr. Ruskin, ""Modern Painters"", III. 227, remarks: ""The first instance I know of its right use, though very probably it had been so employed before, is in Dante. The righteous spirits of the pre-Christian ages are seen by him, though in the Inferno, yet in a place open, luminous and high, walking upon the `green enamel.' ""I am very sure that Dante did not use this phrase as we use it. He knew well what enamel was; and his readers, in order to understand him thoroughly, must remember what it is,--a vitreous paste, dissolved in water, mixed with metallic oxides, to give it the opacity and the color required, spread in a moist state on metal, and afterwards hardened by fire, so as never to change. And Dante means, in using this metaphor of the grass of the Inferno, to mark that it is laid as a tempering and cooling substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy ground; but yet so hardened by the fire, that it is not any more fresh or living grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of eternal green. And we know how "" hard"" Dante's idea of it was; because afterwards, in what is perhaps the most awful passage of the whole Inferno, when the three furies rise at the top of the burning tower, and, catching sight of Dante, and not being able to get at him, shriek wildly for the Gorgon to come up, too, that they may turn him into stone, the word "" stone"" is not hard enough for them. Stone might crumble away after it was made, or something with life might grow upon it; no, it shall not be stone; they will make enamel of him; nothing can grow out of that; it is dead forever."" And yet just before, line 111, Dante speaks of this meadow as a ""meadow of fresh verdure."" Compare Brunetto's ""Tesoretto"", XIII.  ""Ora va mastro Brunetto Per lo cammino stretto, Cercando di vedere, E toccare, e sapere Cio, che gli e destinato. E non fui guari andato, Ch' i' fui nella diserta, Dov' i' non trovai certa Ne strada, ne sentiero. Deh che paese fero Trovai in quelle parti! Che s' io sapessi d'arti Quivi mi bisognava, Che quanto piu mirava, Piu mi parea selvaggio. Quivi non ha viaggio, Quivi non ha persone, Quivi non ha magione, Non bestia, non uccello, Non fiume, non ruscello, Non formica, ne mosca, Ne cosa, ch' i' conosca. E io pensando forte, Dottai ben della morte. E non e maraviglia; Che ben trecento miglia Girava d'ogni lato Quel paese snagiato. Ma si m' assicurai Quando mi ricordai De sicuro segnale, Che contra tutto malev Mi da securamento: E io presi ardimento, Quasi per avventura Per una valle scura, Tanto, ch' al terzo giorno I' mi trovai d'intorno Un grande pian giocondo, Lo piu gaio del mondo, E lo piu dilettoso. Ma ricontar non oso Cio, ch'io trovai, e vidi, Se Dio mi guardi, e guidi. Io non sarei creduto Di cio, ch' i' ho veduto; Ch'i' vidi Imperadori, E Re, e gran signori, E mastri di scienze, Che dittavan sentenze; E vidi tante cose, Che gia 'n rime, ne 'n prose Non le poria ritrare. 128. In the ""Convito"", IV. 28, Dante makes Marcia, Cato's wife, a symbol of the noble soul: "" Per la quale Marzias' intende la nobile anima. "" 129. The Saladin of the Crusades. See Gibbon, Chap. LIX. Dante also makes mention of him, as worthy of affectionate remembrance, in the "" Convito"", IV. 2. Mr. Cary quotes the following passage from Knolle's "" History of the Turks"", page 57:-- ""About this time (1193) died the great Sultan Saladin, the greatest terror of the Christians, who, mindful of man's fragility and the vanity of worldly honors, commanded at the time of his death no solemnity to be used at his burial, but only his shirt, in manner of an ensign, made fast unto the point of a lance, to be carried before his dead body as an ensign, a plain priest going before, and crying aloud unto the people in this sort, `Saladin' Conqueror of the East, of all the greatness and riches he had in his life, carrieth not with him anything more than his shirt. ' A sight worthy so great a king, as wanted nothing to his eternal commendation more than the true knowledge of his salvation in Christ Jesus. He reigned about sixteen years with great honor. "" The following story of Saladin is from the ""Cento Novelle Antiche. "" Roscoe's ""Italian Novelists"", I. 18:-- ""On another occasion the great Saladin, in the career of victory, proclaimed a truce between the Christian armies and his own. During this interval he visited the camp and the cities belonging to his enemies, with the design, should he approve of the customs and manners of the people, of embracing the Christian faith. He observed their tables spread with the finest damask coverings ready prepared for the feast, and he praised their magnificence. On entering the tents of the king of France during a festival, he was much pleased with the order and ceremony with which everything was conducted, and the courteous manner in which he feasted his nobles; but when he approached the residence of the poorer class, and perceived them devouring their miserable pittance upon the ground, he blamed the want of gratitude which permitted so many faithful followers of their chief to fare so much worse than the rest of their Christian brethren. ""Afterwards, several of the Christian leaders returned with the Sultan to observe the manners of the Saracens. They appeared much shocked on seeing all ranks of people take their meals sitting upon the ground. The Sultan led them into a grand pavilion where he feasted his court, surrounded with the most beautiful tapestries, and rich foot-cloths, on which were wrought large embroidered figures of the cross. The Christian chiefs trampled them under their feet with the utmost indifference, and even rubbed their boots, and spat upon them. ""On perceiving this, the Sultan turned towards them in the greatest anger, exclaiming: `And do you who pretend to preach the cross treat it thus ignominiously? Gentlemen, I am shocked at your conduct. Am I to suppose from this that the worship of your Deity consists only in words, not in actions? Neither your manners nor your conduct please me.' And on this he dismissed them, breaking off the truce and commencing hostilities more warmly than before."" 143. Avicenna, an Arabian physician of Ispahan in the eleventh century. Born 980, died 1036. 144. Avverrhoes, an Arabian scholar of the twelfth century, who translated the works of Aristotle, and wrote a commentary upon them. He was born in Cordova in 1149, and died in Morocco, about 1200. He was the head of the Western School of philosophy, as Avicenna was of the Eastern. "

This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't; And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then? I could not find him at the Elephant; Yet there he was; and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service; For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason, that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad, Or else the lady's mad; yet if 'twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing, As I perceive she does. There's something in't That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.   Enter OLIVIA and PRIEST  OLIVIA. Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by; there, before him And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the fun assurance of your faith, That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say?  SEBASTIAN.

Now, as thou lov'st me, let me see his letter.  CLOWN. Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.  FABIAN. Anything.  CLOWN. Do not desire to see this letter.  FABIAN. This is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again. Enter DUKE, VIOLA, CURIO, and LORDS  DUKE. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?  CLOWN. Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.  DUKE. I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow?  CLOWN. Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.  DUKE. Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.  CLOWN. No, sir, the worse.  DUKE. How can that be?  CLOWN. Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused; so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then, the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes.  DUKE. Why, this is excellent.  CLOWN. By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.  DUKE. Thou shalt not be the worse for me. There's gold.  CLOWN. But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.  DUKE. O, you give me ill counsel.  CLOWN. Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.  DUKE. Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer. There's another.  CLOWN. Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying is 'The third pays for all.' The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind- one, two, three.  DUKE. You can fool no more money out of me at this throw; if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.  CLOWN. Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness. But, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap; I will awake it anon. Exit Enter ANTONIO and OFFICERS  VIOLA. Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.  DUKE. That face of his I do remember well; Yet when I saw it last it was besmear'd As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A baubling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and bulk unprizable, With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of los Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?  FIRST OFFICER. Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy; And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In private brabble did we apprehend him.  VIOLA. He did me kindness, sir; drew on my side; But in conclusion put strange speech upon me. I know not what 'twas but distraction.  DUKE. Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief! What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies?  ANTONIO. Orsino, noble sir, Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea's enrag'd and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was. His life I gave him, and did thereto ad My love without retention or restraint, All his in dedication; for his sake, Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset; Where being apprehended, his false cunning, Not meaning to partake with me in danger, Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink; denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.  VIOLA. How can this be?  DUKE. When came he to this town?  ANTONIO. To-day, my lord; and for three months before, No int'rim, not a minute's vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company.   Enter OLIVIA and ATTENDANTS  DUKE. Here comes the Countess; now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow- fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me- But more of that anon. Take him aside.  OLIVIA. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.  VIOLA. Madam?  DUKE. Gracious Olivia-  OLIVIA. What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord-  VIOLA. My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.  OLIVIA. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music.  DUKE. Still so cruel?  OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord.  DUKE. What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings hath breath'd out That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?  OLIVIA. Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.  DUKE. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?- a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly. But hear me this: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour, Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still; But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master's spite. Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief: I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven's heart within a dove.  VIOLA. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.  OLIVIA. Where goes Cesario?  VIOLA. After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love!  OLIVIA. Ay me, detested! How am I beguil'd!  VIOLA. Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?  OLIVIA. Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long? Call forth the holy father. Exit an ATTENDANT  DUKE. Come, away!  OLIVIA. Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.  DUKE. Husband?  OLIVIA. Ay, husband; can he that deny?  DUKE. Her husband, sirrah?  VIOLA. No, my lord, not I.  OLIVIA. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up; Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st.  Enter PRIEST O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold- though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe- what thou dost know Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.  PRIEST. A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strength'ned by interchangement of your rings; And all the ceremony of this compact Seal'd in my function, by my testimony; Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave, I have travell'd but two hours.  DUKE. O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be, When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.  VIOLA. My lord, I do protest-  OLIVIA. O, do not swear! Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear. Enter SIR ANDREW  AGUECHEEK. For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby.  OLIVIA. What's the matter?  AGUECHEEK. Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.  OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew?  AGUECHEEK. The Count's gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.  DUKE. My gentleman, Cesario?  AGUECHEEK. Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for nothing; and that that did, I was set on to do't by Sir Toby.  VIOLA. Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause; But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.   Enter SIR TOBY and CLOWN  AGUECHEEK. If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me; I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more; but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickl'd you othergates than he did.  DUKE. How now, gentleman? How is't with you?  SIR TOBY. That's all one; has hurt me, and there's th' end on't. Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot?  CLOWN. O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i' th' morning.  SIR TOBY. Then he's a rogue and a passy measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.  OLIVIA. Away with him. Who hath made this havoc with them?  AGUECHEEK. I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dress'd together.  SIR TOBY. Will you help- an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin fac'd knave, a gull?  OLIVIA. Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to. Exeunt CLOWN, FABIAN, SIR TOBY, and SIR ANDREW Enter SEBASTIAN  SEBASTIAN. I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman; But, had it been the brother of my blood, I must have done no less with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that I do perceive it hath offended you. Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows We made each other but so late ago.  DUKE. One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons! A natural perspective, that is and is not.  SEBASTIAN. Antonio, O my dear Antonio! How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me Since I have lost thee!  ANTONIO. Sebastian are you?  SEBASTIAN. Fear'st thou that, Antonio?  ANTONIO. How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?  OLIVIA. Most wonderful!  SEBASTIAN. Do I stand there? I never had a brother; Nor can there be that deity in my nature Of here and everywhere. I had a sister Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd. Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman, what name, what parentage?  VIOLA. Of Messaline; Sebastian was my father. Such a Sebastian was my brother too; So went he suited to his watery tomb; If spirits can assume both form and suit, You come to fright us.  SEBASTIAN. A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, And say 'Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!'  VIOLA. My father had a mole upon his brow.  SEBASTIAN. And so had mine.  VIOLA. And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numb'red thirteen years.  SEBASTIAN. O, that record is lively in my soul! He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years.  VIOLA. If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurp'd attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola; which to confirm, I'll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help I was preserv'd to serve this noble Count. All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord.  SEBASTIAN. [To OLIVIA] So Comes it, lady, you have been mistook; But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv'd; You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.  DUKE. Be not amaz'd; right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wreck. [To VIOLA] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.  VIOLA. And all those sayings will I overswear; And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night.  DUKE. Give me thy hand; And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.  VIOLA. The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid's garments.

The Hound of the Baskervilles: Novel Summary: Chapter 2 - 5,"  : Mortimer reads to Holmes and Watson an early 18th-century manuscript that tells of how, in the time of the “Great Rebellion” [i.e., 1641-51], Hugo Baskerville, progenitor of the ancient and wealthy Baskerville line and a “wild, profane and godless man,” kidnapped the maiden daughter of a yeoman who held lands near his estate. For this crime, the document claims, Hugo Baskerville died, ravaged by “a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.” The Baskervilles thus believe a curse has been placed upon their family. Holmes dismisses the story, but is more intrigued when Mortimer reads a recent newspaper account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. A generous philanthropist and a potential candidate for Parliament in an upcoming election, Sir Charles (descendant, of course, of the notorious Hugo) had restored much of his famly’s greatness after it had fallen upon hard times by capitalizing on financial speculations in South Africa. A widower, Sir Charles lived only with his servants at Baskerville Hall, a married couple, the Barrymores, who worked as butler and housekeeper. He lived near Mortimer, who was his personal physician; as well as one Mr. Frankland of Lafter Hall and Mr. Stapleton, a naturalist. Sir Charles was keenly interested in the legend of the Baskerville curse, asking Mortimer several times whether he ever saw or heard strange creatures and noises, especially “the baying of a hound.” Each night before retiring to bed, Sir Charles would walk the Hall’s “famous yew alley.” He never returned from that walk on the evening of May 4; at midnight, Mr. Barrymore found his master lying dead at the alley’s end, past its gate that opens onto the moor surrounding the Hall. Sir Charles’ face wore a terrifyingly distorted expression (attributed in the autopsy to cardiac exhaustion). Barrymore noted that the appearance of Sir Charles’ footprints altered once he had passed that gate, but reported no other physical clues to the inquest. Information that the newspaper account does not include, but what Mortimer now tells Holmes, is that, three weeks prior to Sir Charles’ death, Mortimer had visited the nobleman and caught a glimpse of some large, unknown black animal—the sight of which visibly shook Sir Charles. Furthermore, in the yew-alley, Mortimer saw the “fresh and clear” footprints of a gigantic hound. Analysis: Conan Doyle effectively creates a mood of suspense and fear in this chapter: even though it is set in Holmes and Watson’s Baker Street apartment, it is filled with evocative, atmospheric descriptions of Baskerville Hall, the site of strange—and, perhaps, supernatural—occurrences. The novel is a work of mystery, not horror; nevertheless, this chapter contains elements that might equally be at home in a Gothic tale of terror: the ancient family manor, recently refurbished but still bearing marks of “evil days” gone by (p. 26); a secret, shameful family history in the tale of Hugo Baskerville and his fellow drunken revelers who are struck by terror on the moonlit moors, only to be pursued by evil and misfortune until their (sometimes untimely) deaths; and, of course, our first description of the titular hound, with “its blazing eyes and dripping jaws” (p. 24)—“such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels” (p. 23). The circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death, as well, laid out in careful detail by Conan Doyle as he sets the stage for the detective tale to follow, inspire feelings of dread, which culminate in Mortimer’s nearly whispered revelation that he has seen “the footprints of a gigantic hound” (p. 30). (Indeed, we will read at the beginning of the next chapter that Mortimer’s words gave Watson, a man of science, “a shudder,” p. 31!) Some critics have pointed out that, in real life, one cannot tell the breed of dog merely from its pawprints; but, as Baker Street Journal editor Edgar W. Smith noted, Mortimer’s frequently quoted, chapter-concluding line is all about maximum artistic impact: “I remember one of my sons, when he was very young, going about the house muttering: ‘Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic cocker-spaniel!’ That, I am sure, would not have had quite the same dramatic effect…” (Klinger, p. 414).    The Problem : Holmes questions Mortimer and establishes that the dog he saw was not a sheep dog; that the wicket-gate is the only exit from the yew-alley that leads to the moor, and that Sir Charles had apparently stood there for some time; that the hound’s footprints were clearly on the path and not on the surrounding grass; and that three people report having seen the hound prior to Sir Charles’ death, but none have reported seeing it since. For all this attention to the details of the night in question, however, Mortimer reveals that he does not wish Holmes to investigate Sir Charles’ death. Rather, he has approached the detective for advice about what to do when Sir Charles’ only heir, one Henry Baskerville, returns from abroad. (The only other kinsman was one Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles’ youngest brother and “the black sheep of the family,” who is reported to have died in Central America in 1876.) Mortimer wants the charitable work begun by Sir Charles to continue, and knows that, to that end, Baskerville Hall must have a squire; but he does not want Sir Henry to go to Baskerville Hall for fear of the curse upon the family. Holmes is, of course, deeply skeptical of all such supernatural beliefs; he recommends that Mortimer simply meet Sir Henry at Waterloo Station upon his arrival, yet not tell him anything of the current situation. Mortimer departs, as does Watson, who knows that his friend needs isolation in which to reflect upon the facts of the case. When Watson returns several hours later, he finds Holmes poring over a topographical map of the Baskerville estate and the surrounding lands. Holmes has also concluded that, contrary to Sir Charles’ usual routine, the squire of Baskerville Hall was waiting at the wicket-gate; and that the shifting shape of Sir Charles’ footprints as reported by Mortimer must be due to the fact that Sir Charles began running away from something in terror. Analysis: Conan Doyle created one of the most famous rationalists in world literature, yet he himself remained very open to “supernatural explanation[s]” of worldly phenomena (p. 38). The author was a committed Spiritualist (including his adherence to the belief that the dead could communicate with the living), and is also remembered as one of the more famous defenders of the “Cottingley fairies,” a 1917 incident in which two young girls purported to have taken photographs of fairies in their garden (later proved to be cardboard cutouts). Sherlock Holmes would never for a moment have been taken in by such a ruse, as this chapter makes plain. “We are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses,” he tells Watson, “before falling back upon” supernatural ones (p. 38). Although Holmes demonstrates some respect for Mortimer—when the physician notes the two separate droppings of ash from Sir Charles’ cigar, Holmes proclaims him to be “a colleague, Watson, after our own heart” (p. 33)—he clearly rejects Mortimer’s eager embrace of the paranormal and the otherworldly. As Holmes correctly points out, such an attitude does not quite seem to befit “a trained man of science” (p. 34). Holmes points out inconsistencies in supernaturalism’s own internal logic: for example, he seeks to disarm Mortimer’s fear for Sir Henry’s fate were the scion of the family to return to the state by pointing out that “surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire” (p. 35). And whereas Mortimer gives easy credence to reports of “several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature” (p. 33), Holmes makes it his life’s work to achieve such reconciliations. In maxim-like fashion, Holmes declares to Watson (who is very often the recipient of such lessons in the Holmes stories), “The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes” (p. 37). Observation and logic, not a resort to supernatural hypotheses, prove critical to Holmes’ success. The detective concerns himself with the real world: “The devil’s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not?” he asks (p. 38). As one who has apprehended many criminals prior to this case, Holmes knows the answer must be affirmative!  Sir Henry Baskerville : At ten the next morning, Mortimer arrives at Baker Street with Sir Henry Baskerville, who has already experienced a singular occurrence. Although no one should have known that he had stayed the night at the Northumberland Hotel, he received a letter addressed to him there: a single sheet of paper containing a message composed of words—all but the last one—clipped from a printed source and affixed to the sheet: “As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.” To everyone’s astonishment, Holmes immediately identifies the source of the clippings as the lead article from the previous day’s Times. (The word “moor” had to be supplied by hand in ink because it is a less common word.) Holmes further deduces (from the ink splotches, indicative, he says, of a hotel fountain pen) that the sender of the letter assembled it in a hotel near Charing Cross (from the envelope’s postmark). Whether the letter is warning or threat, no one seems sure. Sir Henry is still unaware of the circumstances surrounding Sir Charles’ death; Mortimer gives him the same account he gave Holmes and Watson the previous day. Sir Henry reports that he bought a new pair of boots upon his arrival in London, and, never having worn them, left them outside his hotel room in order to be varnished overnight. That morning, he discovered one of the boots, and one only, had been stolen. Mortimer and Sir Henry begin walking back to the hotel; allowing them a lead of two hundred yards, Holmes and Watson follow them, unbeknownst to the baronet and the physician. Holmes spies a bearded man in a hansom cab also shadowing the pair; unfortunately, the bearded man notices Holmes and Watson in return, and urges his driver to move quickly on, so that Holmes and Watson cannot catch up. They lose the trail of the hansom cab; they lose track of Mortimer and Sir Henry; but Holmes did note the number of the cab (No. 2704). He plans to send a telegram to ascertain the identity of the driver of that cab; meanwhile, he hires a teenager named Cartwright to inspect the garbage from the 23 hotels in the Charing Cross area, looking for a cut-up front page of yesterday’s Times. This evidence, Holmes reasons, will lead them to the person who sent Sir Henry his mysterious letter. Analysis: As a character, Sir Henry is not yet well-developed in this chapter; however, that is due to the fact that he serves mainly as a way for Conan Doyle to introduce deeper levels of mystery into the tale (the enigmatic letter and the stolen boot). We do, however, read that Sir Henry has “the weather-beaten appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air”—indicative, as he says, of having spent most of his life in the United States and Canada (p. 46)—but also “the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated the gentleman” (p. 41). Sir Henry is both rugged and genteel, civilized and of the frontier. He also intends to continue the good works of his uncle: he intends to fully embrace his role as “squire” (p. 47) of Baskerville Hall. “There is no devil in hell, Mr. Holmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to the home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer” (p. 48). This resolve speaks to Sir Henry’s “fiery temper,” a family trait (p. 48). Therefore, although we do not yet know much about him, he emerges from this chapter as a sympathetic character in whose fate readers will be interested. This chapter also, of course, serves to further dazzle Conan Doyle’s readers with Holmes’ logical prowess. His knowledge of various typefaces (although he allows that, as a younger man, he “confused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News,” p. 44—surely a fully self-aware statement of false humility, since most ordinary people would not even begin to know how to distinguish the papers’ typography), his immediate recall of the number of hotels in the Charing Cross area, his identification of the kind of scissors used by the letter’s compositor, his knowledge of the traits of hotel fountain pens—all these instances further establish Holmes (as though he needed any such establishment in the minds of Conan Doyles’ reading audience!) as master of his “special hobby” of detection (p. 44). We also learn, however, that Holmes does not rely solely on his own efforts. His employment of young Cartwright hearkens back to his use of “the Baker Street Irregulars”—a ragamuffin group of street urchins, who perform various tasks and find out information for Holmes for a shilling reward—in the Conan Doyle’s two previous Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four.  Three Broken Threads : At the Northumberland Hotel, Holmes and Watson find Sir Henry distraught because an old black boot was returned to him in place of the new brown one that was stolen. At lunch, Sir Henry announces his intention to go to Baskerville Hall at the week’s end, a decision Holmes affirms. When Sir Henry asks Holmes to accompany him, Holmes regrets that he cannot, but suggests that Watson go in his stead. Holmes tells Sir Henry and Mortimer that they were followed yesterday; he learns that Barrymore, the butler at Baskerville Hall, has a full, dark beard, as did Sir Henry and Mortimer’s unknown follower. Barrymore and his wife were left £500 each in Sir Charles’ will. Other beneficiaries include £1000 to Mortimer and numerous other individuals and charities. Sir Henry is inheriting £740,000. In all, Sir Charles’ estate is valued “close on to a million.” Holmes learns that, had Sir Henry been unable to inherit the estate, it would have passed to one James Desmond, an elderly clergyman. As the group rises from lunch, Sir Henry spies his missing new brown boot under a cabinet in a corner of the dining room, even though all previous searches had not located it. Upon returning to Baker Street, Holmes receives telegrams informing him that Barrymore the butler is at Baskerville Hall, and that Cartwright was unable to locate the cut-up front page of the previous day’s Times. Also, he and Watson receive a visit from John Clayton, the driver of hansom cab no. 2704. Clayton tells them that his fare, so interested in trailing Sir Henry and Mortimer, was a detective by the name of Sherlock Holmes! Holmes is amused at having been bested by their unknown opponent, but warns Watson that the case is rapidly developing into “an ugly dangerous business.” Analysis: The chapter title is metaphorical, of course: when the interview with Clayton fails to yield the name of his fare, Holmes laments, “Snap goes our third thread [of investigation], and we end where we began” (p. 63). (The other two threads were the location of Barrymore—his presence at Baskerville Hall would seem to argue against his being the bearded man who followed Sir Henry and Mortimer—and Cartwright’s failure to find the mutilated newspaper.) Notice, however, how Holmes often takes setbacks in stride. He greets Clayton’s revelation that his fare was “Sherlock Holmes,” for instance, with “a hearty laugh,” proclaiming (using a metaphor from the sport of fencing), “A touch, Watson—an undeniable touch!” (p. 61). (Klinger notes that Holmes is here alluding to Hamlet, Act V, Scene ii: “Is this further evidence of Holmes’ acting career or merely of his knowledge of literature?”, p. 457.) Holmes is secure enough in his own intellectual ability to recognize when others have bested him (a trait we see in other Holmes stories; for example, his respectful appellation of Irene Adler as “The Woman” in “A Scandal in Bohemia”)—even if, in the end, he has every reason to believe he will gain the upper hand (as he does in this case—else he would not have been able to display what Watson describes as that “remarkable” ability of “detaching his mind at will” in order to enjoy the art exhibition prior to the trip to the Northumberland Hotel, p. 53). In fact, Holmes relishes matching wits with opponents who can challenge him; in several Holmes stories, we see that he cares little for common, unimaginative criminals. No: Holmes is far happier, far more intellectually stimulated, when he is placed in a contest with, as he says here, “a foeman who is worthy of our steel” (p. 63—and one almost senses that the use of the plural pronoun refers not to himself and Watson, but the “royal we”!) For all that it reinforces Holmes’ high opinion of himself, however, this chapter also shows us the true friendship and regard in which he holds his confidante and chronicler, Dr. Watson. When he suggests that Sir Henry take “a trusted man” with him to Baskerville Hall (albeit after begging off being that man himself because of a highly important and delicate case in which he is already involved—an explanation of which readers should make a mental note), he commends Watson to Sir Henry: “there is no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one can say that more confidently than I” (p. 58). The detective may not always acknowledge it openly, but he knows Watson is much more than (as he said in Chapter 1) “a conductor of [Holmes’ own] light.” The good doctor is a man of practical common sense and also capable of direct action; as Watson himself says, “The promise of adventure had always a fascination for me…” (p. 59). The recommendation that Watson accompany Sir Henry also marks a transition to the next portion of the narrative, in which Watson will be much more directly involved in the action.   ",The Hound of the Baskervilles,Chapter 2 - 5," Mr. Sherlock Holmes  Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated at the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a ""Penang lawyer."" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. ""To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,"" was engraved upon it, with the date ""1884."" It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified, solid, and reassuring. ""Well, Watson, what do you make of it?"" Holmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation. ""How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head."" ""I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,"" said he. ""But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it."" ""I think,"" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, ""that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation."" ""Good!"" said Holmes. ""Excellent!"" ""I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot."" ""Why so?"" ""Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it."" ""Perfectly sound!"" said Holmes. ""And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return."" ""Really, Watson, you excel yourself,"" said Holmes, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. ""I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt."" He had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens. ""Interesting, though elementary,"" said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. ""There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions."" ""Has anything escaped me?"" I asked with some self-importance. ""I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?"" ""I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal."" ""Then I was right."" ""To that extent."" ""But that was all."" ""No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest themselves."" ""You may be right."" ""The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor."" ""Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross Hospital,' what further inferences may we draw?"" ""Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!"" ""I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country."" ""I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?"" ""It certainly seems probable."" ""Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff."" I laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling. ""As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,"" said I, ""but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man's age and professional career."" From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.   ""Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.   House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.   Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,   with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?' Corresponding   member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of   'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882). 'Do We Progress?'   (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer   for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow."" ""No mention of that local hunt, Watson,"" said Holmes with a mischievous smile, ""but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room."" ""And the dog?"" ""Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel."" He had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise. ""My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?"" ""For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you, Watson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man of science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!"" The appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. ""I am so very glad,"" said he. ""I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world."" ""A presentation, I see,"" said Holmes. ""Yes, sir."" ""From Charing Cross Hospital?"" ""From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage."" ""Dear, dear, that's bad!"" said Holmes, shaking his head. Dr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. ""Why was it bad?"" ""Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you say?"" ""Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own."" ""Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,"" said Holmes. ""And now, Dr. James Mortimer--"" ""Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S."" ""And a man of precise mind, evidently."" ""A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes whom I am addressing and not--"" ""No, this is my friend Dr. Watson."" ""Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull."" Sherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. ""You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,"" said he. ""I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one."" The man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennae of an insect. Holmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion. ""I presume, sir,"" said he at last, ""that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?"" ""No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe--"" ""Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?"" asked Holmes with some asperity. ""To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly."" ""Then had you not better consult him?"" ""I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently--"" ""Just a little,"" said Holmes. ""I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.""  The Curse of the Baskervilles  ""I have in my pocket a manuscript,"" said Dr. James Mortimer. ""I observed it as you entered the room,"" said Holmes. ""It is an old manuscript."" ""Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery."" ""How can you say that, sir?"" ""You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730."" ""The exact date is 1742."" Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast- pocket. ""This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him."" Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee. ""You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date."" I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: ""Baskerville Hall,"" and below in large, scrawling figures: ""1742."" ""It appears to be a statement of some sort."" ""Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Baskerville family."" ""But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?"" ""Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you."" Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:   ""Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there   have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct   line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from   my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down   with all belief that it occurred even as is here set   forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the   same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously   forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer   and repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this   story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to   be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions   whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not   again be loosed to our undoing.   ""Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the   history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most   earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of   Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be   gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless   man. This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,   seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,   but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour   which made his name a by-word through the West. It   chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark   a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter   of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.   But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,   would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. So   it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five   or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon   the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and   brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had   brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper   chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long   carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass   upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing   and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from   below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,   when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who   said them. At last in the stress of her fear she did that   which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,   for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and   still covers) the south wall she came down from under the   eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three   leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.   ""It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his   guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,   perchance--to his captive, and so found the cage empty   and the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became   as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs   into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,   flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried   aloud before all the company that he would that very   night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if   he might but overtake the wench. And while the revellers   stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,   it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that   they should put the hounds upon her. Whereat Hugo ran   from the house, crying to his grooms that they should   saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the   hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the   line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.   ""Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable   to understand all that had been done in such haste. But   anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed   which was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything   was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,   some for their horses, and some for another flask of   wine. But at length some sense came back to their crazed   minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took   horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above   them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course   which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach   her own home.   ""They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the   night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to   him to know if he had seen the hunt. And the man, as   the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could   scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen   the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. 'But   I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville   passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind   him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at   my heels.' So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd   and rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for   there came a galloping across the moor, and the black   mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing   bridle and empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close   together, for a great fear was on them, but they still   followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,   would have been right glad to have turned his horse's   head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last   upon the hounds. These, though known for their valour   and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the   head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the   moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles   and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.   ""The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you   may guess, than when they started. The most of them   would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,   or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.   Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of   those great stones, still to be seen there, which were   set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.   The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there   in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,   dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight   of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo   Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon   the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it   was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,   there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped   like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal   eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing   tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it   turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the   three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still   screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that   very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were   but broken men for the rest of their days.   ""Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound   which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever   since. If I have set it down it is because that which   is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but   hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many   of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which   have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we   shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,   which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that   third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy   Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend   you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from   crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of   evil are exalted.   ""[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,   with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their   sister Elizabeth.]"" When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire. ""Well?"" said he. ""Do you not find it interesting?"" ""To a collector of fairy tales."" Dr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket. ""Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville which occurred a few days before that date."" My friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:   ""The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose   name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate   for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over   the county. Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville   Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of   character and extreme generosity had won the affection   and respect of all who had been brought into contact with   him. In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing   to find a case where the scion of an old county family   which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own   fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the   fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Charles, as is well known,   made large sums of money in South African speculation.   More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns   against them, he realized his gains and returned to England   with them. It is only two years since he took up his   residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how   large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement   which have been interrupted by his death. Being himself   childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the   whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit   by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons   for bewailing his untimely end. His generous donations   to local and county charities have been frequently   chronicled in these columns.   ""The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles   cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the   inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of   those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.   There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to   imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.   Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to   have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.   In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his   personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville   Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the   husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.   Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,   tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time   been impaired, and points especially to some affection   of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,   breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.   Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of   the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.   ""The facts of the case are simple. Sir Charles Baskerville   was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking   down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall. The evidence   of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.   On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention   of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore   to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual   for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in   the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At   twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,   became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search   of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's   footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down   this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.   There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some   little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and   it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered.   One fact which has not been explained is the statement   of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their   character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and   that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking   upon his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on   the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears   by his own confession to have been the worse for drink.   He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state   from what direction they came. No signs of violence were   to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though   the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible   facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at   first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient   who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom   which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from   cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by   the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing   organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a   verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is   well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost   importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the   Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly   interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not   finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been   whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been   difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall. It is   understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,   if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's   younger brother. The young man when last heard of was   in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a   view to informing him of his good fortune."" Dr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. ""Those are the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir Charles Baskerville."" ""I must thank you,"" said Sherlock Holmes, ""for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?"" ""It does."" ""Then let me have the private ones."" He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression. ""In doing so,"" said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, ""I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Baskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank. ""The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot. ""Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement. ""I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no justification. ""It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His heart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived, however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a serious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the distractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the same opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe. ""On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made the discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was sitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of the event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned at the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the spot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there were no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to such an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was certainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was made by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some little distance off, but fresh and clear."" ""Footprints?"" ""Footprints."" ""A man's or a woman's?"" Dr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank almost to a whisper as he answered. ""Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!""  The Problem  I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly interested. ""You saw this?"" ""As clearly as I see you."" ""And you said nothing?"" ""What was the use?"" ""How was it that no one else saw it?"" ""The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a thought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend."" ""There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?"" ""No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog."" ""You say it was large?"" ""Enormous."" ""But it had not approached the body?"" ""No."" ""What sort of night was it?' ""Damp and raw."" ""But not actually raining?"" ""No."" ""What is the alley like?"" ""There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and impenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across."" ""Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?"" ""Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side."" ""I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?"" ""Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor."" ""Is there any other opening?"" ""None."" ""So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?"" ""There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end."" ""Had Sir Charles reached this?"" ""No; he lay about fifty yards from it."" ""Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you saw were on the path and not on the grass?"" ""No marks could show on the grass."" ""Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?"" ""Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the moor-gate."" ""You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate closed?"" ""Closed and padlocked."" ""How high was it?"" ""About four feet high."" ""Then anyone could have got over it?"" ""Yes."" ""And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?"" ""None in particular."" ""Good heaven! Did no one examine?"" ""Yes, I examined, myself."" ""And found nothing?"" ""It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for five or ten minutes."" ""How do you know that?"" ""Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar."" ""Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the marks?"" ""He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could discern no others."" Sherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient gesture. ""If I had only been there!"" he cried. ""It is evidently a case of extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to the scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs of curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you should not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for."" ""I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to the world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so. Besides, besides--"" ""Why do you hesitate?"" ""There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of detectives is helpless."" ""You mean that the thing is supernatural?"" ""I did not positively say so."" ""No, but you evidently think it."" ""Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several incidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature."" ""For example?"" ""I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen a creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon, and which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all agreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I have cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman, one a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night."" ""And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"" ""I do not know what to believe."" Holmes shrugged his shoulders. ""I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world,"" said he. ""In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material."" ""The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and yet he was diabolical as well."" ""I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it."" ""I did not say that I desired you to do it."" ""Then, how can I assist you?"" ""By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who arrives at Waterloo Station""--Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch--""in exactly one hour and a quarter."" ""He being the heir?"" ""Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will."" ""There is no other claimant, I presume?"" ""None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"" ""Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"" ""It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice."" Holmes considered for a little time. ""Put into plain words, the matter is this,"" said he. ""In your opinion there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"" ""At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence that this may be so."" ""Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a thing."" ""You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you recommend?"" ""I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry Baskerville."" ""And then?"" ""And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my mind about the matter."" ""How long will it take you to make up your mind?"" ""Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry Baskerville with you."" ""I will do so, Mr. Holmes."" He scribbled the appointment on his shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair. ""Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?"" ""Three people did."" ""Did any see it after?"" ""I have not heard of any."" ""Thank you. Good-morning."" Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him. ""Going out, Watson?"" ""Unless I can help you."" ""No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has been submitted to us this morning."" I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more. My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him. ""Caught cold, Watson?"" said he. ""No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."" ""I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."" ""Thick! It is intolerable."" ""Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive."" ""My dear Holmes!"" ""Am I right?"" ""Certainly, but how?"" He laughed at my bewildered expression. ""There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not obvious?"" ""Well, it is rather obvious."" ""The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. Where do you think that I have been?"" ""A fixture also."" ""On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."" ""In spirit?"" ""Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret to observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way about."" ""A large-scale map, I presume?"" ""Very large."" He unrolled one section and held it over his knee. ""Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the middle."" ""With a wood round it?"" ""Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two moorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play it again."" ""It must be a wild place."" ""Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a hand in the affairs of men--"" ""Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."" ""The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"" ""Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."" ""What do you make of it?"" ""It is very bewildering."" ""It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What do you make of that?"" ""Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of the alley."" ""He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"" ""What then?"" ""He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life, running until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face."" ""Running from what?"" ""There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed with fear before ever he began to run."" ""How can you say that?"" ""I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley rather than in his own house?"" ""You think that he was waiting for someone?"" ""The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"" ""But he went out every evening."" ""I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."" "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 5," When he first enters  Circle, Dante sees Minos, a horrible, snarling demon to whom each soul confesses everything, receiving their sentence from him. Minos warns Dante to turn back, but Virgil again asserts that Dante's journey is divinely ordained. Now Dante hears wailing again, in a place where light is mute. A hellish storm drives the spirits ceaselessly through the air like a flock of birds, tormenting them; they have no hope of rest, no hope of less pain. One long line of spirits draws Dante's attention, and he asks Virgil who they are. Virgil tells him of more than a thousand, ""ladies of ancient times and warriors,"" all having died because of love, and Dante is bewildered by pity. Dante asks to speak to two who are borne on the wind together, and who ""seem so light on the wind."" Virgil tells him to ask them to come in the name of their love; they swoop down to him like doves borne to their nest by desire. The woman speaks, full of gratitude for Dante's kind interest, and says that all-powerful Love brought them together and holds them together still. Love led to their dying together, and the deepest pit of Hell is waiting for the man who killed them. Dante recognizes her as Francesca and knows the story of her husband finding her with his brother Paolo and killing them both, and he stands silent with head bowed, thinking of the power of the desire that has brought the two lovers here. Telling Francesca that her suffering makes him weep, he asks how she and Paolo first realized they were in love. She tells how they were reading together of Lancelot's love for Guinevere, and ""when we read that the smile so desired was kissed by so great a lover, this man, who will never be parted from me, kissed my mouth, all trembling. A Galeotto [pander, go-between] was that book and the man who wrote it; that day we read no more"" (lines 133-138). As Francesca speaks, Paolo weeps so bitterly that Dante faints from sheer pity. Analysis This canto is one of the most famous in Dante's Inferno, creating strong reactions in just about everyone who reads it. Paolo and Francesca had been killed only a few years before the year of Dante's journey through the worlds of the afterlife (which he set in 1300), and everyone in Italy at the time knew their story. Some later readers have felt that Dante is showing them as victorious over Hell, since they will be together forever. Others have felt that Dante is showing Francesca as self-deceiving and selfish. What is clear is that Dante is showing himself, at this stage in the journey, as deeply sympathetic with the lovers. We find out in the Purgatorio that he himself tended to be overmastered by desire, and certainly the romantic literature of his day, which he loved, tended to present romantic love as all-powerful and to excuse those who were led by it to break their marriage vows. At the same time, Dante the narrator makes the nature of the punishment reveal the essence of the sin, as so often in the poem: as all those who suffer in  Circle allowed themselves to be swept away by passion while they were alive, ignoring the harm they were doing to themselves and others, so now they are swept away forever by a black wind. At the same time, it is worth noting that those who give in to their passions and desires, who are, in that sense, incontinent-they cannot contain their impulses-are on the highest levels in Hell, the Circles of Incontinence. The giving in to lust seen in this Second Circle, which at least involves some kind of feeling for another person, is the least serious of all the sins-though it is still mortal. It can kill the soul if one does not realize that this kind of love cannot give real happiness, if one becomes addicted to it. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 5," 1. In the Second Circle are found the souls of carnal sinners, whose punishment  ""To be imprisoned in the viewless winds, And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world."" 2. The circles grow smaller and smaller as they descend. 4. Minos, the king of Crete, so renowned for justice as to be called the Favorite of the Gods, and after death made Supreme Judge in the Infernal Regions. Dante furnishes him with a tail, thus converting him, after the mediaeval fashion, into a Christian demon. 21. Thou, too, as well as Charon, to whom[*]Virgil has already made the same reply, Canto 06. 022. 28. In Canto 01. 060, the sun is silent; here the light is dumb. 51. Gower, ""Confession Amantis"", VIII., gives a similar list ""of gentil folke that whilom were lovers,"" seen by him as he lay in a swound and listened to the music Of bombarde and of clarionne With cornemuse and shalmele."" 61. Queen Dido. 65. Achilles, being in love with Polyxena, a daughter of Priam, went unarmed to the temple of Apollo, where he was put to death by Paris. Gower, ""Confessio Amantis "", IV., says:--  ""For I have herde tell also Achilles left his armes so, Both of himself and of his men, At Troie for Polixenen Upon her love when he felle, That for no chaunce that befelle Among the Grekes or up or down He wolde nought ayen the town Ben armed for the love of her."" ""I know not how,"" says Bacon in his Essay on Love, ""but martial men are given to love; I think it is but as they are given to wine; for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasure."" 67. Paris of Troy, of whom Spenser says, ""Faerie Queene"", III.ix. 34:--  ""Most famous Worthy of the world, by whome That warre waas kindled which did Troy inflame And stately towres of Ilion whilome Brought unto balefull ruine, was by name Sir Paris, far renown'd through noble fame."" Tristan is the Sir Tristram of the Romances of Chivalry. See his adventures in the "" Mort d'Arthure."" Also Thomas of Ercildoune's ""Sir Tristram, a Metrical Romance. "" His amours with Yseult of Ysonde bring him to this circle of the Inferno. 71 .

In the original, ""l'aer perso"", the perse air. Dante, "" Convito"", IV. 20, defines perse as ""a color mixed of purple and black, but the black predominates."" Chaucer's ""Doctour of Phisike"" in the "" Canterbury Tales"", Prologue 441, wore this color:--  ""In sanguin and in perse he clad was alle, Lined with taffata and with sendalle."" The Glossary defines it, ""skie colored, of a bluish gray."" The word is again used, VII. 103 and "" Purg."" 09. 097. 97. The city of Ravenna.""One reaches Ravenna,"" says Amp@ere, ""Voyage Dantesque "", p. 311, ""by journeying along the borders of a pine forest, which is seven leagues in length, and which seemed to me an immense funereal wood, serving as an avenue to the common tomb of those two great powers, Dante and the Roman Empire in the West. There is hardly room for any other memories than theirs. But other poetic names are attached to the Pine Woods of Ravenna. Not long ago Lord Byron evoked there the fantastic tales borrowed by Dryden from Boccaccio, and now he is himself a figure of the past, wandering in this melancholy place. I thought, in traversing it, that the singer of despair had ridden along this melancholy shore, trodden before him by the graver and slower footstep of the poet of the Inferno."" 99. Quoting this line, Ampere remarks, ""Voyage Dantesque"", p. 312: ""We have only to cast our eyes upon the map to recognize the topographical exactitude of this last expression. In fact, in all the upper part of its course, the Po receives a multitude of affluents, which converge towards its bed. They are the Tessino, the Adda, the Olio, the Mincio, the Trebbia, the Bormida, the Taro;--names which recur so often in the history of the wars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."" 103. Here the word ""love"" is repeated, as the word ""honor "" was in Canto 04. 072. The verse murmurs with it, like the ""moan of doves in immemorial elms."" St. Augustine says in his "" Confessions"", III. 1: ""I loved not yet, yet I loved to love.....I sought what I might love, in love with loving."" 104. I think it is Coleridge who says: ""The desire of man is for the woman, but the desire of woman is for the desire of man."" 107. Caina is in the lowest circle of the Inferno, where fratricides are punished. 116. Francesca, daughter of Guido da Polenta, Lord of Ravenna, and wife of Gianciotto Malatesta, son of the Lord of Rimini. The lover, Paul Malatesta, was the brother of the husband, who, discovering their amour, put them both to death with his own hand. Carlyle, ""Heroes and Hero Worship"", Lect. III., says:-- ""Dante's painting is not graphic only, brief, true, and of a vividness as of fire in dark night; taken on the wider scale, it is every way noble, and the outcome of a great soul. Francesca and her Lover, what qualities in that! A thing woven as out of rainbows, on a ground of eternal black. A small flute-voice of infinite wail speaks there, into our very heart of hearts. A touch of womanhood in it too: ""della bella persona"", ""che mi fu tolta""; and how, even in the Pit of woe, it is a solace that "" he"" will never part from her! Saddest tragedy in these "" alti guai."" And the racking winds, in that ""aer bruno "", whirl them away again, to wail forever! -- Strange to think: Dante was the friend of this poor Francesca's father; Francesca herself may have sat upon the Poet's knee, as a bright, innocent little child. Infinite pity, yet also infinite rigor of law: it is so Nature is made; it is so Dante discerned that she was made."" Later commentators assert that Dante's friend Guido was not the father of Francesca, but her nephew. Boccaccio's account, translated from his Commentary by Leigh Hunt, "" Stories from the Italian Poets"", Appendix II., is as follows:--""You must know that this lady, Madonna Francesca, was daughter of Messer Guido the Elder, lord of Ravenna and of Cervia, and that a long and grievous war having been waged between him and the lords Malatesta of Rimini, a treaty of peace by certain mediators was at length concluded between them; the which, to the end that it might be the more firmly established, it pleased both parties to desire to fortify by relationship; and the matter of this relationship was so discoursed, that the said Messer Guido agreed to give his young and fair daughter in marriage to Gianciotto, the son of Messer Malatesta. Now, this being made known to certain of the friends of Messer Guido, one of them said to him: `Take care what you do; for if you contrive not matters discreetly, such relationship will beget scandal. You know what manner of person your daughter is, and of how lofty a spirit; and if she see Gianciotto before the bond is tied, neither you nor any one else will have power to persuade her to marry him; therefore, if it so please you, it seems to me that it would be good to conduct the matter thus: namely, that Gianciotto should not come hither himself to marry her, but that a brother of his should come and espouse her in his name.' ""Gianciotto was a man of great spirit, and hoped, after his father's death, to become lord of Rimini; in the contemplation of which event, albeit he was rude in appearance and a cripple, Messer Guido desired him for a son-in-law above any one of his brothers. Discerning, therefore, the reasonableness of what his friend counselled, he secretly disposed matters according to his device; and a day being appointed, Polo, a brother of Gianciotto, came to Ravenna with full authority to espouse Madonna Francesca. Polo was a handsome man, very pleasant, and of a courteous breeding; and passing with other gentlemen over the court-yard of the palace of Messer Guido, a damsel who knew him pointed him out to Madonna Francesca through an opening in the casement, saying, `That is he that is to be your husband'; and so indeed the poor lady believed, and incontinently placed in him her whole affection; and the ceremony of the marriage having been thus brought about, and the lady conveyed to Rimini, she became not aware of the deceit till the morning ensuing the marriage, when she beheld Gianciotto rise from her side; the which discovery moved her to such disdain, that she became not a whit the less rooted in her love for Polo. Nevertheless, that it grew to be unlawful I never heard, except in what is written by this author (Dante), and possibly it might so have become; albeit I take what he says to have been an invention framed on the possibility, rather than anything which he knew of his own knowledge. Be this as it may, Polo and Madonna Francesca living in the same house, and Gianciotto being gone into a certain neighboring district as governor, they fell into great companionship with one another, suspecting nothing; but a servant of Gianciotto's, noting it, went to his master and told him how matters looked; with the which Gianciotto being fiercely moved, secretly returned to Rimini; and seeing Polo enter the room of Madonna Francesca the while he himself was arriving, went straight to the door, and finding it locked inside, called to his lady to come out; for, Madonna Francesca and Polo having descried him, Polo thought to escape suddenly through an opening in the wall, by means of which there was a descent into another room; and therefore, thinking to conceal his fault either wholly or in part, he threw himself into the opening, telling the lady to go and open the door. But his hope did not turn out as he expected; for the hem of a mantle which he had on caught upon a nail, and the lady opening the door meantime, in the belief that all would be well by reason of Polo's not being there, Gianciotto caught sight of Polo as he was detained by the hem of the mantle, and straightway ran with his dagger in his hand to kill him; whereupon the lady, to prevent it, ran between them; but Gianciotto having lifted the dagger, and put the whole force of his arm into the blow, there came to pass what he had not desired,--namely, that he struck the dagger into the bosom of the lady before it could reach Polo; by which accident, being as one who had loved the lady better than himself, he withdrew the dagger and again struck at Polo, and slew him; and so leaving them both dead, he hastily went his way and betook him to his wonted affairs; and the next morning the two lovers, with many tears, were buried together in the same grave."" 121. This thought is from Boethius, ""De Consolat. Philos"")., Lib. II. Prosa 4: ""In omni adversitate fortunae, infelicissimum genus est infortunii fuisse felicem et non esse. "" In the ""Convito"", II. 16, Dante speaks of Boethius and Tully as having directed him ""to the love, that is to the study, of this most gentle lady Philosophy. "" From this Venturi and Biagioli infer that, by the Teacher, Boethius is meant, not Virgil. This interpretation, however, can hardly be accepted, as not in one place only, but throughout the Inferno and the Purgatorio, Dante proclaims Virgil as his teacher, "" il mio Dottore. "" Lombardi thinks that Virgil had experience of this ""greatest sorrow,"" finding himself also in ""the infernal prison""; and that it is to this, in contrast with his happy life on earth, that Francesca alludes, and not to anything in his writings. 128. The Romance of Launcelot of the Lake. See Delvan, ""Biblioteque Bleue "":-- ""Chap. 39. Comment Launcelot et la Reine Genievre deviserent de choses et d'autres, et surtout de choses amoureuses..... ""La Reine, voyant qu'il n'osait plus rien faire ni dire, le prit par le menton et le baisa assez longuement en presence de Gallehault. "" The Romance was to these two lovers, what Galeotto (Gallehault or Sir Galahad) had been to Launcelot and Queen Guenever. Leigh Hunt speaks of the episode of Francesca as standing in the Inferno ""like a lily in the mouth of Tartarus."" 142. Chaucer, ""Knightes Tale"":--  ""The colde death, with mouth gaping upright.""

The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 8," When Dante and Virgil come to the foot of the tower, they see two lights shining from it, and another light in the distance flashing in reply. Dante wants to know what's going on, and Virgil points out something coming toward them across the marsh. It's a little boat, and the demon who steers it, Phlegyas, gloats, thinking Dante is an evil soul that has come into his power, then swells with held-in rage when Virgil tells him they are only going to cross. Virgil gets in the boat first, but it is only when Dante gets in that the boat sinks lower in the water. As they cross, one of the spirits wallowing in the mire asks Dante who he is. Dante recognizes him and feels no pity: Filippo Argenti is where he belongs. Filippo reaches out toward the boat, but Virgil pushes him away, and blesses Dante for his indignation, saying that this man was utterly arrogant while he lived and is now furious because no good is remembered of him. Many now living who think they are great kings will meet the same fate. Dante wants to see Filippo thrust deeper into the mire, and his wish is fulfilled when the whole crowd of angry souls attack Filippo, and he even attacks himself. Now Dante hears more sounds of grief and gazes intently forward. Virgil tells him that they are approaching the mighty city of Dis. Dante sees its mosques, lit by the glow of the eternal fire within. They come to the gates of Dis and get out of the boat, and above the gates they see a host of fallen angels, who say that no living man may enter here. They invite Virgil to come, and tell Dante he must go back alone, if he can. Now Dante is really scared, and he begs Virgil not to go, but Virgil says their entering can't be stopped, and promises not to forsake Dante. He goes to talk to the fallen angels, now devils; Dante can't hear what they're saying, but he sees them slam the gates shut in Virgil's face. Virgil comes back with all his self-confidence gone, but he assures Dante that even now someone is on the way down the steps of Hell to open the gates of the city. Analysis The way Dante weighs down the boat reminds us-he is a living human being, still in his body, while the others are bodiless shades. He can still choose; he is not stuck. It's interesting that, even in traditions where there's a belief in reincarnation, being in a human body is thought of as giving a unique opportunity for spiritual growth. The scene with Filippo Argenti has horrified many readers. What kind of Christianity is this? Could it be, some ask, that Dante the pilgrim is being shown as affected by Hell, taking on the sins he condemns? One answer that has been given is that on the literal level, all the pilgrim's reactions to the souls in Hell are reflections of their own state, as though to underline that they can only have what they chose while they were alive. Allegorically, it's easier-Dante for the first time sees his own tendency to violent, destructive anger and summons up the energy of righteous anger to reject it. As for the political meaning, Filippo was a Florentine, and he was typical of the arrogant and violent aristocrats who were doing Florence so much damage. The city of Dis consists of all the rest of Hell: the walls of Dis go all the way around the pit. Only within these walls does the fire of Hell burn. Allegorically, on the personal level, this is the point where Dante must begin to confront, not just his tendencies to give in to lust or anger and so on, but his actual, willed choice to do harm to others and himself, turning his back on the love that he believes has been revealed to him through Christ-and Beatrice. Virgil's help is not enough, when it comes to facing this truth about himself. Dante sees the ""mosques"" of the city of Dis. We saw earlier that Dante could revere the valor and wisdom of three great Muslims, Saladin, Avicenna, and Averroes, but here we see that he shared the belief that prevailed in his day, that Islam was a willed, deliberate turning away from the love revealed in Christ, a ""heresy."" From that point of view, mosques are what one would expect to find in the city of Dis. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 8," 1. Boccaccio and some other commentators think the words ""I say, continuing,"" are a confirmation of the theory that the first seven cantos of the Inferno were written before Dante's banishment from Florence. Others maintain that the words suggest only the continuation of the subject of the last canto in this. 4. These two signal fires announce the arrival of two persons to be ferried over the wash, and the other in the distance is on the watch-tower of the City of Dis, answering these. 19. Phlegyas was the father of Ixion and Coronis. He was king of the Lapithae, and burned the temple of Apollo at Delphi to avenge the wrong done by the god to Coronis. His punishment in the infernal regions was to stand beneath a huge impending rock, always about to fall upon him. Virgil, Aeneid, VI., says of him: ""Phlegyas, most wretched, is a monitor to all and with loud voice proclaims through the shades, `Being warned, learn righteousness, and not to contemn the gods.'"" 27. Virgil, Aeneid, VI.:""The boat of sewn hide groaned under the weight, and, being leaky, took in much water from the lake."" 49. Mr. Wright here quotes Spenser, Ruins of Time:--  ""How many great ones may remembered be, Who in their days most famously did flourish, Of whom no word we have, nor sign now see, But as things wiped out with a sponge do perish."" 51. Chaucer's ""sclandre of his diffame."" 61. Of Philippo Argenti little is known, and nothing to his credit. Dante seems to have an especial personal hatred of him, as if in memory of some disagreeable passage between them in the streets of Florence. Boccaccio says of him in his Comento: ""This Philippo Argenti, as Coppo di Borghese Domenichi de' Cavicciuli was wont to say, was a very rich gentleman, so rich that he had the horse he used to ride shod with silver, and from this he had his surname; he was in person large, swarthy, muscular, of marvellous strength, and at the slightest provocation the most irascible of men; nor are any more known of his qualities than these two, each in itself very blameworthy."" He was of the Adimari family, and of the Neri faction; while Dante was of the Bianchi party, and in banishment. Perhaps this fact may explain the bitterness of his invective. This is the same Philippo Argenti who figures in Boccaccio's tale. See Inf. VI., note 52. The Ottimo Comento says of him: ""He was a man of great pomp, and great ostentation, and much expenditure, and little virtue and worth; and therefore the author says, `Goodness is none that decks his memory.'"" And this is all that is known of the ""Fiorentino spirito bizzaro,"" forgotten by history, and immortalized in song. ""What a barbarous strength and confusion of ideas,"" exclaims Leigh Hunt, Italian Poets, p. 60, "" is there in this whole passage about him! Arrogance punished by arrogance, a Christian mother blessed for the unchristian disdainfulness of her son, revenge boasted of and enjoyed, passion arguing in a circle."" 70. The word ""mosques"" paints at once to the imagination the City of Unbelief. 78. Virgil, Aeneid, VI., Davidson's Translation:--Aeneas on a sudden looks back, and under a rock on the left sees vast prisons inclosed with a triple wall, which Tartarean Phlegethon's rapid flood environs with torrents of flame, and whirls roaring rocks along. Fronting is a huge gate, with columns of solid adamant, that no strength of men, nor the gods themselves, can with steel demolish. An iron tower rises aloft; and there wakeful Tisiphone, with her bloody robe tucked up around her, sits to watch the vestibule both night and day."" 124. This arrogance of theirs; tracotanza, oltracotanza ; Brantome's outrecuidance; and Spenser's surquedrie. 125. The gate of the Inferno. 130.

"Crime and Punishment: Novel Summary: Part 4, Chapter 3-Part 4, Chapter 4","   Katherine, who is increasingly emotionally unstable, asks Luzhin to come to her aid, citing her father's hospitality to him. He waves her away contemptuously, openly denying that he knew her father. He goes immediately to Sonia and accuses her of stealing a one hundred-ruble note from his room during their meeting. Katherine rushes to her defense, vehemently denying that Sonia would do such a thing. Sonia is frightened and horrified. She responds that she didn't take anything and gives him back the ten-ruble note he had given her. Sonia looks around her in despair and sees the crowd eyeing her with hostility. Raskolnikov is gazing steadily at her. In anger at Luzhin's accusations, Katherine searches Sonia's pockets. In her right pocket she finds a crumpled one hundred-ruble bill. Katherine still does not believe Sonia is guilty. She gives a pathetic plea to the crowd to come to her aid. Suddenly, a voice in the doorway says, How lowdown that is! It is Lebeziatnikov, who testifies that he had seen Luzhin slip the bill into Sonia's pocket and had thought at the time it was because he was doing a good deed. Raskolnikov immediately speaks up and spells out a motive, relaying the details of Luzhin's engagement to Dunia and how he had tried to put Raskolnikov in a bad light by slandering Sonia. Luzhin leaves and on his way out, someone in the crowd throws a glass at him but misses and hits the landlady. At this, she evicts Katherine and her family. Raskolnikov goes to follow Sonia, who had fled. Sonia exclaims, What would have happened to me if you hadn't been there! Raskolnikov responds by telling her the incident was based on her social position. He then asks if it were for her to decide, who she would choose to remain alive, Katherine or Luzhin. She rebukes him for asking her something that shouldn't be asked. She keeps asking him what is wrong, sensing something horrible. He understands that she loves him, however, and struggles to reveal the truth. He reminds her that he had promised to tell her who had killed Lizaveta and asks her if she can guess. He turns to face her and says, Take a good look. After understanding, Sonia collapses with grief, but then goes to him and holds both his hands. Why, why did you take this upon yourself! she says and throws her arms around his neck. When he tells her she is strange for embracing him after he what he has told her, she says, ...there is nobody...anywhere in the world now unhappier than you! She says she will go with him to Siberia. He responds saying that maybe he does not want to go to Siberia and in that voice she hears the tones of the murderer. Raskolnikov offers various explanations for his crime, but settles on I killed for myself, myself alone. Sonia instructs him to rise and go to the crossroads, to bow down and kiss the earth which he has defiled, then bow down to the four points of the compass and say aloud, I have killed. She says, You must accept suffering and redeem yourself by it. Raskolnikov still resists the idea of repentance and confession.  Since Sonia had turned to him with all her heart he was more miserable. She offers him a cross made of Cypress and says she'll wear one of brass that was given to her by Lizaveta. At that moment, there is a knock at the door. It is Lebeziatnikov. ",Crime and Punishment,"Part 4, Chapter 3-Part 4, Chapter 4"," Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where to turn for Kapernaumov's door, a door opened three paces from him; he mechanically took hold of it. ""Who is there?"" a woman's voice asked uneasily. ""It's I . . . come to see you,"" answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the tiny entry. On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick. ""It's you! Good heavens!"" cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to the spot. ""Which is your room? This way?"" and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at her, hastened in. A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes . . . She felt sick and ashamed and happy, too. . . . Raskolnikov turned away quickly and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance. It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left. In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging. Sonia's room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light. The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead, beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall- paper was black in the corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain. Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter of her destinies. ""I am late. . . . It's eleven, isn't it?"" he asked, still not lifting his eyes. ""Yes,"" muttered Sonia, ""oh yes, it is,"" she added, hastily, as though in that lay her means of escape. ""My landlady's clock has just struck . . . I heard it myself. . . ."" ""I've come to you for the last time,"" Raskolnikov went on gloomily, although this was the first time. ""I may perhaps not see you again . . ."" ""Are you . . . going away?"" ""I don't know . . . to-morrow. . . ."" ""Then you are not coming to Katerina Ivanovna to-morrow?"" Sonia's voice shook. ""I don't know. I shall know to-morrow morning. . . . Never mind that: I've come to say one word. . . ."" He raised his brooding eyes to her and suddenly noticed that he was sitting down while she was all the while standing before him. ""Why are you standing? Sit down,"" he said in a changed voice, gentle and friendly. She sat down. He looked kindly and almost compassionately at her. ""How thin you are! What a hand! Quite transparent, like a dead hand."" He took her hand. Sonia smiled faintly. ""I have always been like that,"" she said. ""Even when you lived at home?"" ""Yes."" ""Of course, you were,"" he added abruptly and the expression of his face and the sound of his voice changed again suddenly. He looked round him once more. ""You rent this room from the Kapernaumovs?"" ""Yes. . . ."" ""They live there, through that door?"" ""Yes. . . . They have another room like this."" ""All in one room?"" ""Yes."" ""I should be afraid in your room at night,"" he observed gloomily. ""They are very good people, very kind,"" answered Sonia, who still seemed bewildered, ""and all the furniture, everything . . . everything is theirs. And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me."" ""They all stammer, don't they?"" ""Yes. . . . He stammers and he's lame. And his wife, too. . . . It's not exactly that she stammers, but she can't speak plainly. She is a very kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven children . . . and it's only the eldest one that stammers and the others are simply ill . . . but they don't stammer. . . . But where did you hear about them?"" she added with some surprise. ""Your father told me, then. He told me all about you. . . . And how you went out at six o'clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna knelt down by your bed."" Sonia was confused. ""I fancied I saw him to-day,"" she whispered hesitatingly. ""Whom?"" ""Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten o'clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna. . . ."" ""You were walking in the streets?"" ""Yes,"" Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and looking down. ""Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?"" ""Oh no, what are you saying? No!"" Sonia looked at him almost with dismay. ""You love her, then?"" ""Love her? Of course!"" said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she clasped her hands in distress. ""Ah, you don't. . . . If you only knew! You see, she is quite like a child. . . . Her mind is quite unhinged, you see . . . from sorrow. And how clever she used to be . . . how generous . . . how kind! Ah, you don't understand, you don't understand!"" Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort of /insatiable/ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in every feature of her face. ""Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me, what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it. . . . She is so unhappy . . . ah, how unhappy! And ill. . . . She is seeking righteousness, she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness everywhere and she expects it. . . . And if you were to torture her, she wouldn't do wrong. She doesn't see that it's impossible for people to be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is good!"" ""And what will happen to you?"" Sonia looked at him inquiringly. ""They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands before, though. . . . And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well, how will it be now?"" ""I don't know,"" Sonia articulated mournfully. ""Will they stay there?"" ""I don't know. . . . They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady, I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina Ivanovna says that she won't stay another minute."" ""How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?"" ""Oh, no, don't talk like that. . . . We are one, we live like one."" Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. ""And what could she do? What, what could she do?"" she persisted, getting hot and excited. ""And how she cried to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven't you noticed it? At one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the lunch and all that. . . . Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in her fancies! One can't contradict her. And all the day long she has been washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are quite worn out. Only the money we'd reckoned wasn't enough, not nearly enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste, you don't know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the shopmen because she hadn't enough. . . . Ah, it was sad to see her. . . ."" ""Well, after that I can understand your living like this,"" Raskolnikov said with a bitter smile. ""And aren't you sorry for them? Aren't you sorry?"" Sonia flew at him again. ""Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you'd seen nothing of it, and if you'd seen everything, oh dear! And how often, how often I've brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I've done it! Ah, I've been wretched at the thought of it all day!"" Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it. ""You were cruel?"" ""Yes, I--I. I went to see them,"" she went on, weeping, ""and father said, 'read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here's a book.' He had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, 'I can't stay,' as I didn't want to read, and I'd gone in chiefly to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them. 'Make me a present of them, Sonia,' she said, 'please do.' '/Please do/,' she said, she wanted them so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn't had all these years! And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she'd sooner give away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I was sorry to give them. 'What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?' I said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her. And it was so sad to see. . . . And she was not grieved for the collars, but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back, change it, take back those words! Ah, if I . . . but it's nothing to you!"" ""Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?"" ""Yes. . . . Did you know her?"" Sonia asked with some surprise. ""Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon die,"" said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question. ""Oh, no, no, no!"" And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring that she should not. ""But it will be better if she does die."" ""No, not better, not at all better!"" Sonia unconsciously repeated in dismay. ""And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?"" ""Oh, I don't know,"" cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her hands to her head. It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and he had only roused it again. ""And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?"" he persisted pitilessly. ""How can you? That cannot be!"" And Sonia's face worked with awful terror. ""Cannot be?"" Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. ""You are not insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry. . . . Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the hospital, she will die, and the children . . ."" ""Oh, no. . . . God will not let it be!"" broke at last from Sonia's overburdened bosom. She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb entreaty, as though it all depended upon him. Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed. Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible dejection. ""And can't you save? Put by for a rainy day?"" he asked, stopping suddenly before her. ""No,"" whispered Sonia. ""Of course not. Have you tried?"" he added almost ironically. ""Yes."" ""And it didn't come off! Of course not! No need to ask."" And again he paced the room. Another minute passed. ""You don't get money every day?"" Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again. ""No,"" she whispered with a painful effort. ""It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,"" he said suddenly. ""No, no! It can't be, no!"" Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though she had been stabbed. ""God would not allow anything so awful!"" ""He lets others come to it."" ""No, no! God will protect her, God!"" she repeated beside herself. ""But, perhaps, there is no God at all,"" Raskolnikov answered with a sort of malignance, laughed and looked at her. Sonia's face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands. ""You say Katerina Ivanovna's mind is unhinged; your own mind is unhinged,"" he said after a brief silence. Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And certainly he looked like a madman. ""What are you doing to me?"" she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden anguish clutched at her heart. He stood up at once. ""I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity,"" he said wildly and walked away to the window. ""Listen,"" he added, turning to her a minute later. ""I said just now to an insolent man that he was not worth your little finger . . . and that I did my sister honour making her sit beside you."" ""Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?"" cried Sonia, frightened. ""Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I'm . . . dishonourable. . . . Ah, why did you say that?"" ""It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that's true,"" he added almost solemnly, ""and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself /for nothing/. Isn't that fearful? Isn't it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,"" he went on almost in a frenzy, ""how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!"" ""But what would become of them?"" Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion. Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either, and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long tortured her. ""What, what,"" he thought, ""could hitherto have hindered her from putting an end to it?"" Only then he realised what those poor little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna, knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia. But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind, since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he knew that Sonia's position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought, have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him. . . . ""There are three ways before her,"" he thought, ""the canal, the madhouse, or . . . at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns the heart to stone."" The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing that the last end was the most likely. ""But can that be true?"" he cried to himself. ""Can that creature who has still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now, because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot be!"" he cried, as Sonia had just before. ""No, what has kept her from the canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children. . . . And if she has not gone out of her mind . . . but who says she has not gone out of her mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does? How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn't that all mean madness?"" He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed better than any other. He began looking more intently at her. ""So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?"" he asked her. Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer. ""What should I be without God?"" she whispered rapidly, forcibly, glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand. ""Ah, so that is it!"" he thought. ""And what does God do for you?"" he asked, probing her further. Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak chest kept heaving with emotion. ""Be silent! Don't ask! You don't deserve!"" she cried suddenly, looking sternly and wrathfully at him. ""That's it, that's it,"" he repeated to himself. ""He does everything,"" she whispered quickly, looking down again. ""That's the way out! That's the explanation,"" he decided, scrutinising her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling. He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed to him more and more strange, almost impossible. ""She is a religious maniac!"" he repeated to himself. There was a book lying on the chest of drawers. He had noticed it every time he paced up and down the room. Now he took it up and looked at it. It was the New Testament in the Russian translation. It was bound in leather, old and worn. ""Where did you get that?"" he called to her across the room. She was still standing in the same place, three steps from the table. ""It was brought me,"" she answered, as it were unwillingly, not looking at him. ""Who brought it?"" ""Lizaveta, I asked her for it."" ""Lizaveta! strange!"" he thought. Everything about Sonia seemed to him stranger and more wonderful every moment. He carried the book to the candle and began to turn over the pages. ""Where is the story of Lazarus?"" he asked suddenly. Sonia looked obstinately at the ground and would not answer. She was standing sideways to the table. ""Where is the raising of Lazarus? Find it for me, Sonia."" She stole a glance at him. ""You are not looking in the right place. . . . It's in the fourth gospel,"" she whispered sternly, without looking at him. ""Find it and read it to me,"" he said. He sat down with his elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and looked away sullenly, prepared to listen. ""In three weeks' time they'll welcome me in the madhouse! I shall be there if I am not in a worse place,"" he muttered to himself. Sonia heard Raskolnikov's request distrustfully and moved hesitatingly to the table. She took the book however. ""Haven't you read it?"" she asked, looking up at him across the table. Her voice became sterner and sterner. ""Long ago. . . . When I was at school. Read!"" ""And haven't you heard it in church?"" ""I . . . haven't been. Do you often go?"" ""N-no,"" whispered Sonia. Raskolnikov smiled. ""I understand. . . . And you won't go to your father's funeral to-morrow?"" ""Yes, I shall. I was at church last week, too . . . I had a requiem service."" ""For whom?"" ""For Lizaveta. She was killed with an axe."" His nerves were more and more strained. His head began to go round. ""Were you friends with Lizaveta?"" ""Yes. . . . She was good . . . she used to come . . . not often . . . she couldn't. . . . We used to read together and . . . talk. She will see God."" The last phrase sounded strange in his ears. And here was something new again: the mysterious meetings with Lizaveta and both of them-- religious maniacs. ""I shall be a religious maniac myself soon! It's infectious!"" ""Read!"" he cried irritably and insistently. Sonia still hesitated. Her heart was throbbing. She hardly dared to read to him. He looked almost with exasperation at the ""unhappy lunatic."" ""What for? You don't believe? . . ."" she whispered softly and as it were breathlessly. ""Read! I want you to,"" he persisted. ""You used to read to Lizaveta."" Sonia opened the book and found the place. Her hands were shaking, her voice failed her. Twice she tried to begin and could not bring out the first syllable. ""Now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany . . ."" she forced herself at last to read, but at the third word her voice broke like an overstrained string. There was a catch in her breath. Raskolnikov saw in part why Sonia could not bring herself to read to him and the more he saw this, the more roughly and irritably he insisted on her doing so. He understood only too well how painful it was for her to betray and unveil all that was her /own/. He understood that these feelings really were her /secret treasure/, which she had kept perhaps for years, perhaps from childhood, while she lived with an unhappy father and a distracted stepmother crazed by grief, in the midst of starving children and unseemly abuse and reproaches. But at the same time he knew now and knew for certain that, although it filled her with dread and suffering, yet she had a tormenting desire to read and to read to /him/ that he might hear it, and to read /now/ whatever might come of it! . . . He read this in her eyes, he could see it in her intense emotion. She mastered herself, controlled the spasm in her throat and went on reading the eleventh chapter of St. John. She went on to the nineteenth verse: ""And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother. ""Then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house. ""Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. ""But I know that even now whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee. . . ."" Then she stopped again with a shamefaced feeling that her voice would quiver and break again. ""Jesus said unto her, thy brother shall rise again. ""Martha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection, at the last day. ""Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me though he were dead, yet shall he live. ""And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this? ""She saith unto Him,"" (And drawing a painful breath, Sonia read distinctly and forcibly as though she were making a public confession of faith.) ""Yea, Lord: I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God Which should come into the world."" She stopped and looked up quickly at him, but controlling herself went on reading. Raskolnikov sat without moving, his elbows on the table and his eyes turned away. She read to the thirty-second verse. ""Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. ""When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled, ""And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and see. ""Jesus wept. ""Then said the Jews, behold how He loved him! ""And some of them said, could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"" Raskolnikov turned and looked at her with emotion. Yes, he had known it! She was trembling in a real physical fever. He had expected it. She was getting near the story of the greatest miracle and a feeling of immense triumph came over her. Her voice rang out like a bell; triumph and joy gave it power. The lines danced before her eyes, but she knew what she was reading by heart. At the last verse ""Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind . . ."" dropping her voice she passionately reproduced the doubt, the reproach and censure of the blind disbelieving Jews, who in another moment would fall at His feet as though struck by thunder, sobbing and believing. . . . ""And /he, he/--too, is blinded and unbelieving, he, too, will hear, he, too, will believe, yes, yes! At once, now,"" was what she was dreaming, and she was quivering with happy anticipation. ""Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. ""Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days."" She laid emphasis on the word /four/. ""Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? ""Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me. ""And I knew that Thou hearest Me always; but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me. ""And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. ""And he that was dead came forth."" (She read loudly, cold and trembling with ecstasy, as though she were seeing it before her eyes.) ""Bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him and let him go. ""Then many of the Jews which came to Mary and had seen the things which Jesus did believed on Him."" She could read no more, closed the book and got up from her chair quickly. ""That is all about the raising of Lazarus,"" she whispered severely and abruptly, and turning away she stood motionless, not daring to raise her eyes to him. She still trembled feverishly. The candle-end was flickering out in the battered candlestick, dimly lighting up in the poverty-stricken room the murderer and the harlot who had so strangely been reading together the eternal book. Five minutes or more passed. ""I came to speak of something,"" Raskolnikov said aloud, frowning. He got up and went to Sonia. She lifted her eyes to him in silence. His face was particularly stern and there was a sort of savage determination in it. ""I have abandoned my family to-day,"" he said, ""my mother and sister. I am not going to see them. I've broken with them completely."" ""What for?"" asked Sonia amazed. Her recent meeting with his mother and sister had left a great impression which she could not analyse. She heard his news almost with horror. ""I have only you now,"" he added. ""Let us go together. . . . I've come to you, we are both accursed, let us go our way together!"" His eyes glittered ""as though he were mad,"" Sonia thought, in her turn. ""Go where?"" she asked in alarm and she involuntarily stepped back. ""How do I know? I only know it's the same road, I know that and nothing more. It's the same goal!"" She looked at him and understood nothing. She knew only that he was terribly, infinitely unhappy. ""No one of them will understand, if you tell them, but I have understood. I need you, that is why I have come to you."" ""I don't understand,"" whispered Sonia. ""You'll understand later. Haven't you done the same? You, too, have transgressed . . . have had the strength to transgress. You have laid hands on yourself, you have destroyed a life . . . /your own/ (it's all the same!). You might have lived in spirit and understanding, but you'll end in the Hay Market. . . . But you won't be able to stand it, and if you remain alone you'll go out of your mind like me. You are like a mad creature already. So we must go together on the same road! Let us go!"" ""What for? What's all this for?"" said Sonia, strangely and violently agitated by his words. ""What for? Because you can't remain like this, that's why! You must look things straight in the face at last, and not weep like a child and cry that God won't allow it. What will happen, if you should really be taken to the hospital to-morrow? She is mad and in consumption, she'll soon die and the children? Do you mean to tell me Polenka won't come to grief? Haven't you seen children here at the street corners sent out by their mothers to beg? I've found out where those mothers live and in what surroundings. Children can't remain children there! At seven the child is vicious and a thief. Yet children, you know, are the image of Christ: 'theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.' He bade us honour and love them, they are the humanity of the future. . . ."" ""What's to be done, what's to be done?"" repeated Sonia, weeping hysterically and wringing her hands. ""What's to be done? Break what must be broken, once for all, that's all, and take the suffering on oneself. What, you don't understand? You'll understand later. . . . Freedom and power, and above all, power! Over all trembling creation and all the ant-heap! . . . That's the goal, remember that! That's my farewell message. Perhaps it's the last time I shall speak to you. If I don't come to-morrow, you'll hear of it all, and then remember these words. And some day later on, in years to come, you'll understand perhaps what they meant. If I come to-morrow, I'll tell you who killed Lizaveta. . . . Good-bye."" Sonia started with terror. ""Why, do you know who killed her?"" she asked, chilled with horror, looking wildly at him. ""I know and will tell . . . you, only you. I have chosen you out. I'm not coming to you to ask forgiveness, but simply to tell you. I chose you out long ago to hear this, when your father talked of you and when Lizaveta was alive, I thought of it. Good-bye, don't shake hands. To-morrow!"" He went out. Sonia gazed at him as at a madman. But she herself was like one insane and felt it. Her head was going round. ""Good heavens, how does he know who killed Lizaveta? What did those words mean? It's awful!"" But at the same time /the idea/ did not enter her head, not for a moment! ""Oh, he must be terribly unhappy! . . . He has abandoned his mother and sister. . . . What for? What has happened? And what had he in his mind? What did he say to her? He had kissed her foot and said . . . said (yes, he had said it clearly) that he could not live without her. . . . Oh, merciful heavens!"" Sonia spent the whole night feverish and delirious. She jumped up from time to time, wept and wrung her hands, then sank again into feverish sleep and dreamt of Polenka, Katerina Ivanovna and Lizaveta, of reading the gospel and him . . . him with pale face, with burning eyes . . . kissing her feet, weeping. On the other side of the door on the right, which divided Sonia's room from Madame Resslich's flat, was a room which had long stood empty. A card was fixed on the gate and a notice stuck in the windows over the canal advertising it to let. Sonia had long been accustomed to the room's being uninhabited. But all that time Mr. Svidriga�lov had been standing, listening at the door of the empty room. When Raskolnikov went out he stood still, thought a moment, went on tiptoe to his own room which adjoined the empty one, brought a chair and noiselessly carried it to the door that led to Sonia's room. The conversation had struck him as interesting and remarkable, and he had greatly enjoyed it--so much so that he brought a chair that he might not in the future, to-morrow, for instance, have to endure the inconvenience of standing a whole hour, but might listen in comfort.  "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 18," Dante tells us the shape of the Eighth Circle; he calls it Malebolge, evil pouches. Each ""pouch,"" or bolgia, goes all the way around the yet deeper pit that yawns in the center, and each one holds a different kind of sinner. Dante and Virgil cross each bolgia by a spur of rock that forms a bridge over it. Around the bottom of  Pouch, lashed by horned demons, go the panders and seducers. Among the panders in  Bolgia is someone Dante recognizes who confesses that is true that he made his sister sleep with a powerful nobleman, and among the seducers is Jason, the ""hero"" who brought back the Golden Fleece to Greece, using and leaving several women in the process. In  Bolgia, plunged in what looks and smells like excrement from human outhouses, are the flatterers. Analysis No one in either of these bolgias asks to be remembered when Dante returns to the world; their sins, which involve either betraying innocent women or using the uniquely human gift of speech to manipulate rather than to tell the truth, are too vile. Dante and Virgil do not linger. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 18," 1. Here begins the third division of the Inferno, embracing the Eight and Ninth Circles, in which the Fraudulent are punished.  ""But because fraud is man's peculiar vice More it displeases God; and so stand lowest The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them. "" The Eighth Circle is called Malebolge, or Evil-budgets, and consists of ten concentric ditches, or Bolge of stone, with dikes between, and rough bridges running across them to the centre like the spokes of a wheel. In the First Bolgia are punished Seducers, and in the Second, Flatterers. 2. Mr. Ruskin, Modern Painters, III. p. 237, says:-- ""Our slates and granites are often of very lovely colors; but the Apennine limestone is so gray and toneless, that I know not any mountain district so utterly melancholy as those which are composed of this rock, when unwooded. Now, as far as I can discover from the internal evidence in his poem, nearly all Dante's mountain wanderings had been upon this ground. He had journeyed once or twice among the Alps, indeed, but seems to have been impressed chiefly by the road from Garda to Trent, and that along the Cornice, both of which are either upon those limestones, or a dark serpentine, which shows hardly any color till it is polished. It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen rock scenery of the finely colored kind, aided by the Alpine mosses: I do not know the fall at Forli (Inferno, XVI. 99), but every other scene to which he alludes is among these Apennine limestones; and when he wishes to give the idea of enormous mountain size, he names Tabernicch and Pietra- pana,--the one clearly chosen only for the sake of the last syllable of its name, in order to make a sound as of crackling ice, with the two sequent rhymes of the stanza,-- and the other is an Apennine near Lucca. ""His idea, therefore, of rock color, founded on these experiences, is that of a dull or ashen gray, more or less stained by the brown of iron ochre, precisely as the Apennine limestones nearly always are; the gray being peculiarly cold and disagreeable. As we go down the very hill which stretches out from Pietra-pana towards Lucca, the stones laid by the road-side to mend it are of this ashen gray, with efflorescences of manganese and iron in the fissures. The whole of Malebolge is made of this rock, `All wrought in stone of iron-colored grain.'"" 29. The year of Jubilee 1300. Mr. Norton, in his Notes of Travel and Study in Italy, p. 255, thus describes it:-- ""The beginning of the new century brought many pilgrims to the Papal city, and the Pope, seeing to what account the treasury of indulgences possessed by the Church might now be turned, hit upon the plan of promising plenary indulgence to all who, during the year, should visit with fit dispositions the holy places of Rome. He accordingly, in the most solemn manner, proclaimed a year of Julilee, to date from the Christmas of 1299, and appointed a similar celebration for each hundreth year thereafter. The report of the marvellous promise spread rapidly through Europe; and as the year advanced, pilgrims poured into Italy from remote as well as from neighbouring lands. The roads leading to Rome were dusty with bands of travellers pressing forward to gain the unwonted indulgence. The Crusades had made travel familiar to men, and a journey to Rome seemed easy to those who had dreamed of the Farther East, of Constantinople, and Jerusalem. Giovanni Villani, who was among the pilgrims from Florence, declares that there were never less than two hundred thousand strangers at Rome during the year; and Guglielmo Ventura, the chronicler of Asti, reports the total number of pilgrims at not less than two millions. The picture which he draws of Rome during the Jubilee is a curious one. ` Mirandum est quod passim ibant viri et mulieres, qui anno illo Romae fuerunt quo ego ibi fui et per dies xv. steti. De pane, vino, carnibus, piscibus, et avena, bonum mercatum ibi erat; foenum carissimum ibi fuit; hospitia carissima; taliter quod lectus meus et equi mei super faeno et avena constabat mihi tornesium unum grossum. Exiens de Roma in vigilia Nativitatis Christi, vidi turbam magnam, quam dinumerare nemo poterat; et fama erat inter Romanos, quod ibi fuerant plusquam vigenti centum millia virorum et mulierum. Pluries ego vidi ibi tam viros quam mulieres conculcatos sub pedibus aliorum; et etiam egomet in eodem periculo plures vices evasi. Papa innumerabilem pecuniam ab eisdem recepit, quia die ac nocte duo clerici stabant ad altare Sancti Pauli tenentes in eorum manibus rastellos, rastellantes pecuniam infinitam. ' To accommodate the throng of pilgrims, and to protect them as far as possible from the danger which Ventura feelingly describes, a barrier was erected along the middle of the bridge under the castle of Sant' Angelo, so that those goint to St. Peter's and those coming from the church, passing on opposite sides, might not interfere with each other. It seems not unlikely that Dante himself was one of the crowd who thus crossed the old bridge, over whose arches, during this year, a flood of men was flowing almost as constantly as the river's flood ran through below."" 31. The castle is the Castle of St. Angelo, and the mountain Monte Gianicolo. See Barlow, Study of Dante p. 126. Others say Monte Giordano. 50. ""This Caccinimico,"" says Benvenuto da Imola, ""was a Bolognese; a liberal, noble, pleasant, and very powerful man."" Nevertheless he was so utterly corrupt as to sell his sister, the fair Ghisola, to the Marquis of Este. 51. In the original the word is salse. ""In Bologna,"" says Benvenuto da Imola, ""the name of Salse is given to a certain valley outside the city, and near to Santa Maria in Monte, into which the mortal remains of desperadoes, usurers, and other infamous persons are wont to be thrown. Hence I have sometimes heard boys in Bologna say to each other, by way of insult, `Your father was thrown into the Salse.'"" 61. The two rivers between which Bologna is situated. In the Bolognese dialect sipa is used for si. 72. They cease going round the circles as heretofore, and now go straight forward to the centre of the abyss. 86. For the story of Jason, Medea, and the Golden Fleece, see Ovid, Metamorph. VII. Also Chaucer, Legende of Goode Women :--  ""Thou roote of fals loveres, duke Jason! Thou slye devourer and confusyon Of gentil wommen, gentil creatures!"" 92. When the women of Lemnos put to death all the male inhabitans of the island, Hypsipyle concealed her father Thaos, and spared his life. Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautics, II., Fawke's Tr.: --  ""Hypsipyle alone, illustrious maid, Spared her sire Thaos, who the sceptre swayed."" 122. ""Allessio Interminelli,"" says Benvenuto da Imola, ""a soldier, a nobleman, and of gentle manners was of Lucca, and from his descended that tyrant Castruccio who filled all Tuscany with fear, and was lord of Pisa, Lucca, and Pistoja, of whom Dante makes no mention, because he became illustrious after the author's death. Alessio took such delight in flattery, that he could not open his mouth without flattering. He besmeared everybody, even the lowest menials. "" The Ottimo says, that in the dialect of Lucca the head ""was facetiously called a pumpkin."" 133. Thais, the famous courtesan of Athens. Terence, The Eunuch, Act III, Sc. I:--  ""Thraso. Did Tha,is really return me many thanks? ""Gnatho. Exceeding thanks. ""Thraso. Was she delighted, say you? ""Gnatho. Not so much, indeed, at the present itself, as because it was given by you; really, in right earnest, she does exult at that."" 136. ""The filthiness of some passages,"" exclaims Landor, Pentameron,p. 15, ""would disgrace the drunkenest horse-dealer; and the names of such criminals are recorded by the poet, as would be forgotten by the hangman in six months."" "
"Crime and Punishment: Novel Summary: Part 4, Chapter 1-Part 4, Chapter 2","   Luzhin is sobered by yesterday's events with Dunia. He and his roommate, Lebeziatnikov, who is a simple-minded and extremely idealistic socialist, have grown to dislike one another. They discuss current political and social topics, while Luzhin counts his money on a table. Sonia is mentioned and Luzhin suddenly brightens and says he would like to meet her. When she is brought in, he asks her questions about her family's financial situation and discusses the possibility of holding some sort of lottery in Katherine's benefit. As she leaves, Luzhin gives Sonia a ten-ruble note. Afterwards, Lebeziatnikov warmly tells him that he SAW everything. Out of pride of the poor, Katherine has prepared a lavish funeral feast and invited everyone. The landlady, with whom she does not get along, has helped in the preparations. However, many of the tenants do not show up and the ones who do tend to be of lower social status, a fact which vexes Katherine. When Raskolnikov arrives, Katherine immediately seats him by her side, overjoyed. Throughout the dinner, she makes critical and teasing remarks about the landlady, who overhears. Finally, the two women begin screaming at one another. The fight is cut short when Luzhin enters. ",Crime and Punishment,"Part 4, Chapter 1-Part 4, Chapter 2"," It was nearly eight o'clock. The two young men hurried to Bakaleyev's, to arrive before Luzhin. ""Why, who was that?"" asked Razumihin, as soon as they were in the street. ""It was Svidriga�lov, that landowner in whose house my sister was insulted when she was their governess. Through his persecuting her with his attentions, she was turned out by his wife, Marfa Petrovna. This Marfa Petrovna begged Dounia's forgiveness afterwards, and she's just died suddenly. It was of her we were talking this morning. I don't know why I'm afraid of that man. He came here at once after his wife's funeral. He is very strange, and is determined on doing something. . . . We must guard Dounia from him . . . that's what I wanted to tell you, do you hear?"" ""Guard her! What can he do to harm Avdotya Romanovna? Thank you, Rodya, for speaking to me like that. . . . We will, we will guard her. Where does he live?"" ""I don't know."" ""Why didn't you ask? What a pity! I'll find out, though."" ""Did you see him?"" asked Raskolnikov after a pause. ""Yes, I noticed him, I noticed him well."" ""You did really see him? You saw him clearly?"" Raskolnikov insisted. ""Yes, I remember him perfectly, I should know him in a thousand; I have a good memory for faces."" They were silent again. ""Hm! . . . that's all right,"" muttered Raskolnikov. ""Do you know, I fancied . . . I keep thinking that it may have been an hallucination."" ""What do you mean? I don't understand you."" ""Well, you all say,"" Raskolnikov went on, twisting his mouth into a smile, ""that I am mad. I thought just now that perhaps I really am mad, and have only seen a phantom."" ""What do you mean?"" ""Why, who can tell? Perhaps I am really mad, and perhaps everything that happened all these days may be only imagination."" ""Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again! . . . But what did he say, what did he come for?"" Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute. ""Now let me tell you my story,"" he began, ""I came to you, you were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry's, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn't speak in the right way. They don't seem to understand and can't understand, but are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I'd brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn't say a word. But, you see, I thought I'd made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger or anything, but why need you care? You needn't care a hang for them. We shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I'd mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they'll be afterwards! Hang them! We can thrash them afterwards, but let's laugh at them now!"" ""To be sure,"" answered Raskolnikov. ""But what will you say to-morrow?"" he thought to himself. Strange to say, till that moment it had never occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin's account of his visit to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone since then. In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table. Razumihin and Raskolnikov were facing Pulcheria Alexandrovna, Razumihin was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister. A moment's silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position. But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that. ""I trust you had a favourable journey,"" he inquired officially of Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ""Oh, very, Pyotr Petrovitch."" ""I am gratified to hear it. And Avdotya Romanovna is not over-fatigued either?"" ""I am young and strong, I don't get tired, but it was a great strain for mother,"" answered Dounia. ""That's unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length. 'Mother Russia,' as they say, is a vast country. . . . In spite of all my desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all passed off without inconvenience?"" ""Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, ""and if Dmitri Prokofitch had not been sent us, I really believe by God Himself, we should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch Razumihin,"" she added, introducing him to Luzhin. ""I had the pleasure . . . yesterday,"" muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent. Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who, directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society. Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again. ""Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?"" she began having recourse to her leading item of conversation. ""To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidriga�lov set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife's funeral. So at least I have excellent authority for believing."" ""To Petersburg? here?"" Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother. ""Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it."" ""Good heavens! won't he leave Dounia in peace even here?"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ""I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now discovering where he is lodging."" ""Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have given me,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: ""I've only seen him twice, but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the cause of Marfa Petrovna's death."" ""It's impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men. I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to Siberia, was hushed up. That's the sort of man he is, if you care to know."" ""Good heavens!"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened attentively. ""Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of this?"" Dounia asked sternly and emphatically. ""I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear. There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich, a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other commissions, and with this woman Svidriga�lov had for a long while close and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that the child had been . . . cruelly outraged by Svidriga�lov. It is true, this was not clearly established, the information was given by another German woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna's money and exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom."" ""I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself."" ""Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him, to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr. Svidriga�lov."" ""I don't know that,"" answered Dounia, dryly. ""I only heard a queer story that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher, the servants used to say, 'he read himself silly,' and that he hanged himself partly on account of Mr. Svidriga�lov's mockery of him and not his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for Philip's death."" ""I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his defence all of a sudden,"" Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into an ambiguous smile, ""there's no doubt that he is an astute man, and insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it's my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor's prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him, having regard for his children's interests, and, if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a man of his habits."" ""Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,"" said Dounia, ""say no more of Mr. Svidriga�lov. It makes me miserable."" ""He has just been to see me,"" said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for the first time. There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused. ""An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and introduced himself,"" Raskolnikov continued. ""He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that you can receive the money very shortly."" ""Thank God!"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. ""Pray for her soul, Dounia!"" ""It's a fact!"" broke from Luzhin. ""Tell us, what more?"" Dounia urged Raskolnikov. ""Then he said that he wasn't rich and all the estate was left to his children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere not far from me, but where, I don't know, I didn't ask. . . ."" ""But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna in a fright. ""Did he tell you?"" ""Yes."" ""What was it?"" ""I'll tell you afterwards."" Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea. Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch. ""I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in your way,"" he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up. ""Don't go, Pyotr Petrovitch,"" said Dounia, ""you intended to spend the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an explanation with mother."" ""Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,"" Pyotr Petrovitch answered impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. ""I certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidriga�lov, I, too, do not desire and am not able to speak openly . . . in the presence of others . . . of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty and urgent request has been disregarded. . . ."" Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence. ""Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was disregarded solely at my instance,"" said Dounia. ""You wrote that you had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at once, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you, then he /should/ and /will/ apologise."" Pyotr Petrovitch took a stronger line. ""There are insults, Avdotya Romanovna, which no goodwill can make us forget. There is a line in everything which it is dangerous to overstep; and when it has been overstepped, there is no return."" ""That wasn't what I was speaking of exactly, Pyotr Petrovitch,"" Dounia interrupted with some impatience. ""Please understand that our whole future depends now on whether all this is explained and set right as soon as possible. I tell you frankly at the start that I cannot look at it in any other light, and if you have the least regard for me, all this business must be ended to-day, however hard that may be. I repeat that if my brother is to blame he will ask your forgiveness."" ""I am surprised at your putting the question like that,"" said Luzhin, getting more and more irritated. ""Esteeming, and so to say, adoring you, I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family. Though I lay claim to the happiness of your hand, I cannot accept duties incompatible with . . ."" ""Ah, don't be so ready to take offence, Pyotr Petrovitch,"" Dounia interrupted with feeling, ""and be the sensible and generous man I have always considered, and wish to consider, you to be. I've given you a great promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you--it must be either you or he. That is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don't want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off with my brother, for my brother's sake I must break off with you. I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the husband for me."" ""Avdotya Romanovna,"" Luzhin declared huffily, ""your words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you. To say nothing of your strange and offensive setting me on a level with an impertinent boy, you admit the possibility of breaking your promise to me. You say 'you or he,' showing thereby of how little consequence I am in your eyes . . . I cannot let this pass considering the relationship and . . . the obligations existing between us."" ""What!"" cried Dounia, flushing. ""I set your interest beside all that has hitherto been most precious in my life, what has made up the /whole/ of my life, and here you are offended at my making too /little/ account of you."" Raskolnikov smiled sarcastically, Razumihin fidgeted, but Pyotr Petrovitch did not accept the reproof; on the contrary, at every word he became more persistent and irritable, as though he relished it. ""Love for the future partner of your life, for your husband, ought to outweigh your love for your brother,"" he pronounced sententiously, ""and in any case I cannot be put on the same level. . . . Although I said so emphatically that I would not speak openly in your brother's presence, nevertheless, I intend now to ask your honoured mother for a necessary explanation on a point of great importance closely affecting my dignity. Your son,"" he turned to Pulcheria Alexandrovna, ""yesterday in the presence of Mr. Razsudkin (or . . . I think that's it? excuse me I have forgotten your surname,"" he bowed politely to Razumihin) ""insulted me by misrepresenting the idea I expressed to you in a private conversation, drinking coffee, that is, that marriage with a poor girl who has had experience of trouble is more advantageous from the conjugal point of view than with one who has lived in luxury, since it is more profitable for the moral character. Your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion Romanovitch."" ""I don't remember,"" faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ""I repeated them as I understood them. I don't know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated."" ""He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation."" ""Pyotr Petrovitch,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared with dignity, ""the proof that Dounia and I did not take your words in a very bad sense is the fact that we are here."" ""Good, mother,"" said Dounia approvingly. ""Then this is my fault again,"" said Luzhin, aggrieved. ""Well, Pyotr Petrovitch, you keep blaming Rodion, but you yourself have just written what was false about him,"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna added, gaining courage. ""I don't remember writing anything false."" ""You wrote,"" Raskolnikov said sharply, not turning to Luzhin, ""that I gave money yesterday not to the widow of the man who was killed, as was the fact, but to his daughter (whom I had never seen till yesterday). You wrote this to make dissension between me and my family, and for that object added coarse expressions about the conduct of a girl whom you don't know. All that is mean slander."" ""Excuse me, sir,"" said Luzhin, quivering with fury. ""I enlarged upon your qualities and conduct in my letter solely in response to your sister's and mother's inquiries, how I found you, and what impression you made on me. As for what you've alluded to in my letter, be so good as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn't throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that family, however unfortunate."" ""To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones."" ""Would you go so far then as to let her associate with your mother and sister?"" ""I have done so already, if you care to know. I made her sit down to-day with mother and Dounia."" ""Rodya!"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Dounia crimsoned, Razumihin knitted his brows. Luzhin smiled with lofty sarcasm. ""You may see for yourself, Avdotya Romanovna,"" he said, ""whether it is possible for us to agree. I hope now that this question is at an end, once and for all. I will withdraw, that I may not hinder the pleasures of family intimacy, and the discussion of secrets."" He got up from his chair and took his hat. ""But in withdrawing, I venture to request that for the future I may be spared similar meetings, and, so to say, compromises. I appeal particularly to you, honoured Pulcheria Alexandrovna, on this subject, the more as my letter was addressed to you and to no one else."" Pulcheria Alexandrovna was a little offended. ""You seem to think we are completely under your authority, Pyotr Petrovitch. Dounia has told you the reason your desire was disregarded, she had the best intentions. And indeed you write as though you were laying commands upon me. Are we to consider every desire of yours as a command? Let me tell you on the contrary that you ought to show particular delicacy and consideration for us now, because we have thrown up everything, and have come here relying on you, and so we are in any case in a sense in your hands."" ""That is not quite true, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, especially at the present moment, when the news has come of Marfa Petrovna's legacy, which seems indeed very apropos, judging from the new tone you take to me,"" he added sarcastically. ""Judging from that remark, we may certainly presume that you were reckoning on our helplessness,"" Dounia observed irritably. ""But now in any case I cannot reckon on it, and I particularly desire not to hinder your discussion of the secret proposals of Arkady Ivanovitch Svidriga�lov, which he has entrusted to your brother and which have, I perceive, a great and possibly a very agreeable interest for you."" ""Good heavens!"" cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Razumihin could not sit still on his chair. ""Aren't you ashamed now, sister?"" asked Raskolnikov. ""I am ashamed, Rodya,"" said Dounia. ""Pyotr Petrovitch, go away,"" she turned to him, white with anger. Pyotr Petrovitch had apparently not at all expected such a conclusion. He had too much confidence in himself, in his power and in the helplessness of his victims. He could not believe it even now. He turned pale, and his lips quivered. ""Avdotya Romanovna, if I go out of this door now, after such a dismissal, then, you may reckon on it, I will never come back. Consider what you are doing. My word is not to be shaken."" ""What insolence!"" cried Dounia, springing up from her seat. ""I don't want you to come back again."" ""What! So that's how it stands!"" cried Luzhin, utterly unable to the last moment to believe in the rupture and so completely thrown out of his reckoning now. ""So that's how it stands! But do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, that I might protest?"" ""What right have you to speak to her like that?"" Pulcheria Alexandrovna intervened hotly. ""And what can you protest about? What rights have you? Am I to give my Dounia to a man like you? Go away, leave us altogether! We are to blame for having agreed to a wrong action, and I above all. . . ."" ""But you have bound me, Pulcheria Alexandrovna,"" Luzhin stormed in a frenzy, ""by your promise, and now you deny it and . . . besides . . . I have been led on account of that into expenses. . . ."" This last complaint was so characteristic of Pyotr Petrovitch, that Raskolnikov, pale with anger and with the effort of restraining it, could not help breaking into laughter. But Pulcheria Alexandrovna was furious. ""Expenses? What expenses? Are you speaking of our trunk? But the conductor brought it for nothing for you. Mercy on us, we have bound you! What are you thinking about, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was you bound us, hand and foot, not we!"" ""Enough, mother, no more please,"" Avdotya Romanovna implored. ""Pyotr Petrovitch, do be kind and go!"" ""I am going, but one last word,"" he said, quite unable to control himself. ""Your mamma seems to have entirely forgotten that I made up my mind to take you, so to speak, after the gossip of the town had spread all over the district in regard to your reputation. Disregarding public opinion for your sake and reinstating your reputation, I certainly might very well reckon on a fitting return, and might indeed look for gratitude on your part. And my eyes have only now been opened! I see myself that I may have acted very, very recklessly in disregarding the universal verdict. . . ."" ""Does the fellow want his head smashed?"" cried Razumihin, jumping up. ""You are a mean and spiteful man!"" cried Dounia. ""Not a word! Not a movement!"" cried Raskolnikov, holding Razumihin back; then going close up to Luzhin, ""Kindly leave the room!"" he said quietly and distinctly, ""and not a word more or . . ."" Pyotr Petrovitch gazed at him for some seconds with a pale face that worked with anger, then he turned, went out, and rarely has any man carried away in his heart such vindictive hatred as he felt against Raskolnikov. Him, and him alone, he blamed for everything. It is noteworthy that as he went downstairs he still imagined that his case was perhaps not utterly lost, and that, so far as the ladies were concerned, all might ""very well indeed"" be set right again.

"Winesburg, Ohio: Novel Summary: Respectability, The Thinker & Tandy","Respectability Wash Williams is a huge, dirty, misshapen man who looks something like an ugly monkey. He has no friends and he hates women. Only George Willard knows his story. Wash had a beautiful wife who he loved in his own lovely youth, when he worked in the telegraph office in Columbus, Ohio. Then, he found out she had lovers and sent her back to her mother's house. When her mother asked Wash to come see his wife in Dayton, he would have taken her back if her mother had not devised a plan that horrified him and destroyed his belief in women. She sent Wash's wife into the room naked, hoping that would make him take her back. Wash was shocked and attacked his wife's mother with a chair. Now he despises all women and pities all men. This event also made the telegraph operator much less effective in his job, and he was transferred to Winesburg. The Thinker Seth Richmond is a young man with a rather forbidding kind of demeanor. He is so quiet that people think he is a deep thinker and are intimidated by him. Actually, he is just a manipulative person who does not have much to say. Even his mother is frightened by him. Once, he ran away with some other youths to the county fair and spent a few days stealing farmers' lunches and having fun. Upon his return, he manipulated his mother so she did not admonish him. When George Willard decides to be in love with Helen White, he asks Seth to speak to her on his behalf, since Seth knows Helen better than he does. Seth is irritated by this request and leaves abruptly. He thinks George is a fool. Seth wanders the streets for a while, feeling depressed because he does not feel part of the life of his own town. Eventually, he reaches the Whites' house. Helen answers the door and he invites her for a walk. He tells her that he is going away to Columbus and talks about his plans to get into the university there. He says nothing about George. Helen is impressed by Seth's determination. There is affection between them but neither knows how to express it. After they part, Seth thinks that Helen will end up with someone like George rather than with him. Tandy This brief story tells of how a girl named Tandy acquired her name. When Tandy was a little girl, her family did not pay much attention to her. One day, a drunken stranger told her that her name should be Tandy and that she could then be all that men want from a woman. After that, the little girl insisted on being called Tandy. The drunken man left Winesburg with nothing to show for his attempts to get sober. Analysis All three of these stories focus on the difficulty of relations between men and women. Men and women simply cannot communicate with one another. Wash adored his wife, but they had secrets and the relationship clearly was not based on open communication. His mother-in-law misunderstood and thought that the relationship was simply sexual, and so she disgusted him. A relationship that he hoped would be a sustaining and fulfilling one turned out to be just a base, physical relationship, and so he is disgusted by all relationships. So, too, does Seth Richmond have communication problems. Everyone assumes that he is deep because of his silence, but ""no great underlying purpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had no definite plan for his life"" (127). He is simply blustering, and so the moment of connection with Helen White is empty of honest communication. His mother's fear of him is also based on her misunderstanding his silence. Tandy's story should be a moving one, because a stranger has given her a strong identity. Actually, his strong desire for women to fulfill his needs has led him to place his own desires upon her, whether she is really that person or not. Tandy, he explains, is a quality: ""something men need from women and that they do not get"" (141). Of course, she is just a little child, and he is projecting his needs upon her. This creates a great deal of stress for the child, who now feels she needs to live up to being Tandy. These stories also reflect the city/small town divide. Wash had lived in the city with his young wife, and that is where everything went wrong. He has been sent to this small town because he is not fit to be a big city telegraph operator. Seth claims he is going to leave the town and go to the city. George Willard, he thinks ""belongs to this town"" but he himself does not because he is too silent (131). The town is provincial, where people know each other, George gathers up their stories, and people chat with each other. The town also has limited opportunity, which is why Seth claims to be leaving and why Wash was sent there. Young men who want to get ahead, like Ned Currie, go to the city, but then they lose their connection with people that they have in the town. Perhaps this is why Seth is so ambivalent about going away from the town. What he really wants is to be someone in the small town who is important enough to be leaving for the city. ","Winesburg, Ohio","Respectability, The Thinker & Tandy","['\n\nIF YOU HAVE lived in cities and have walked in the\npark on a summer afternoon, you have perhaps\nseen, blinking in a corner of his iron cage, a huge,\ngrotesque kind of monkey, a creature with ugly, sag-\nging, hairless skin below his eyes and a bright pur-\nple underbody. This monkey is a true monster. In\nthe completeness of his ugliness he achieved a kind\nof perverted beauty. Children stopping before the\ncage are fascinated, men turn away with an air of\ndisgust, and women linger for a moment, trying per-\nhaps to remember which one of their male acquain-\ntances the thing in some faint way resembles.\n\nHad you been in the earlier years of your life a\ncitizen of the village of  , there\nwould have been for you no mystery in regard to\nthe beast in his cage. ""It is like Wash Williams,"" you\nwould have said. ""As he sits in the corner there, the\nbeast is exactly like old Wash sitting on the grass in\nthe station yard on a summer evening after he has\nclosed his office for the night.""\n\nWash Williams, the telegraph operator of Wines-\nburg, was the ugliest thing in town. His girth was\nimmense, his neck thin, his legs feeble. He was\ndirty. Everything about him was unclean. Even the\nwhites of his eyes looked soiled.\n\nI go too fast. Not everything about Wash was un-\nclean. He took care of his hands. His fingers were\nfat, but there was something sensitive and shapely\nin the hand that lay on the table by the instrument\nin the telegraph office. In his youth Wash Williams\nhad been called the best telegraph operator in the\nstate, and in spite of his degradement to the obscure\noffice at Winesburg, he was still proud of his ability.\n\nWash Williams did not associate with the men of\nthe town in which he lived. ""I\'ll have nothing to do\nwith them,"" he said, looking with bleary eyes at the\nmen who walked along the station platform past the\ntelegraph office. Up along Main Street he went in\nthe evening to Ed Griffith\'s saloon, and after drink-\ning unbelievable quantities of beer staggered off to\nhis room in the New Willard House and to his bed\nfor the night.\n\nWash Williams was a man of courage. A thing\nhad happened to him that made him hate life, and\nhe hated it wholeheartedly, with the abandon of a\npoet. First of all, he hated women. ""Bitches,"" he\ncalled them. His feeling toward men was somewhat\ndifferent. He pitied them. ""Does not every man let\nhis life be managed for him by some bitch or an-\nother?"" he asked.\n\nIn Winesburg no attention was paid to Wash Wil-\nliams and his hatred of his fellows. Once Mrs.\nWhite, the banker\'s wife, complained to the tele-\ngraph company, saying that the office in Winesburg\nwas dirty and smelled abominably, but nothing\ncame of her complaint. Here and there a man re-\nspected the operator. Instinctively the man felt in\nhim a glowing resentment of something he had not\nthe courage to resent. When Wash walked through\nthe streets such a one had an instinct to pay him\nhomage, to raise his hat or to bow before him. The\nsuperintendent who had supervision over the tele-\ngraph operators on the railroad that went through\nWinesburg felt that way. He had put Wash into the\nobscure office at Winesburg to avoid discharging\nhim, and he meant to keep him there. When he\nreceived the letter of complaint from the banker\'s\nwife, he tore it up and laughed unpleasantly. For\nsome reason he thought of his own wife as he tore\nup the letter.\n\nWash Williams once had a wife. When he was still\na young man he married a woman at Dayton, Ohio.\nThe woman was tall and slender and had blue eyes\nand yellow hair. Wash was himself a comely youth.\nHe loved the woman with a love as absorbing as the\nhatred he later felt for all women.\n\nIn all of Winesburg there was but one person who\nknew the story of the thing that had made ugly the\nperson and the character of Wash Williams. He once\ntold the story to George Willard and the telling of\nthe tale came about in this way:\n\nGeorge Willard went one evening to walk with\nBelle Carpenter, a trimmer of women\'s hats who\nworked in a millinery shop kept by Mrs. Kate\nMcHugh. The young man was not in love with the\nwoman, who, in fact, had a suitor who worked as\nbartender in Ed Griffith\'s saloon, but as they walked\nabout under the trees they occasionally embraced.\nThe night and their own thoughts had aroused\nsomething in them. As they were returning to Main\nStreet they passed the little lawn beside the railroad\nstation and saw Wash Williams apparently asleep on\nthe grass beneath a tree. On the next evening the\noperator and George Willard walked out together.\nDown the railroad they went and sat on a pile of\ndecaying railroad ties beside the tracks. It was then\nthat the operator told the young reporter his story\nof hate.\n\nPerhaps a dozen times George Willard and the\nstrange, shapeless man who lived at his father\'s\nhotel had been on the point of talking. The young\nman looked at the hideous, leering face staring\nabout the hotel dining room and was consumed\nwith curiosity. Something he saw lurking in the star-\ning eyes told him that the man who had nothing to\nsay to others had nevertheless something to say to\nhim. On the pile of railroad ties on the summer eve-\nning, he waited expectantly. When the operator re-\nmained silent and seemed to have changed his mind\nabout talking, he tried to make conversation. ""Were\nyou ever married, Mr. Williams?"" he began. ""I sup-\npose you were and your wife is dead, is that it?""\n\nWash Williams spat forth a succession of vile\noaths. ""Yes, she is dead,"" he agreed. ""She is dead\nas all women are dead. She is a living-dead thing,\nwalking in the sight of men and making the earth\nfoul by her presence."" Staring into the boy\'s eyes,\nthe man became purple with rage. ""Don\'t have fool\nnotions in your head,"" he commanded. ""My wife,\nshe is dead; yes, surely. I tell you, all women are\ndead, my mother, your mother, that tall dark\nwoman who works in the millinery store and with\nwhom I saw you walking about yesterday--all of\nthem, they are all dead. I tell you there is something\nrotten about them. I was married, sure. My wife was\ndead before she married me, she was a foul thing\ncome out a woman more foul. She was a thing sent\nto make life unbearable to me. I was a fool, do you\nsee, as you are now, and so I married this woman.\nI would like to see men a little begin to understand\nwomen. They are sent to prevent men making the\nworld worth while. It is a trick in Nature. Ugh! They\nare creeping, crawling, squirming things, they with\ntheir soft hands and their blue eyes. The sight of a\nwoman sickens me. Why I don\'t kill every woman\nI see I don\'t know.""\n\nHalf frightened and yet fascinated by the light\nburning in the eyes of the hideous old man, George\nWillard listened, afire with curiosity. Darkness came\non and he leaned forward trying to see the face of\nthe man who talked. When, in the gathering dark-\nness, he could no longer see the purple, bloated face\nand the burning eyes, a curious fancy came to him.\nWash Williams talked in low even tones that made\nhis words seem the more terrible. In the darkness\nthe young reporter found himself imagining that he\nsat on the railroad ties beside a comely young man\nwith black hair and black shining eyes. There was\nsomething almost beautiful in the voice of Wash Wil-\nliams, the hideous, telling his story of hate.\n\nThe telegraph operator of Winesburg, sitting in\nthe darkness on the railroad ties, had become a poet.\nHatred had raised him to that elevation. ""It is because\nI saw you kissing the lips of that Belle Carpenter\nthat I tell you my story,"" he said. ""What happened\nto me may next happen to you. I want to put you\non your guard. Already you may be having dreams\nin your head. I want to destroy them.""\n\nWash Williams began telling the story of his mar-\nried life with the tall blonde girl with the blue eyes\nwhom he had met when he was a young operator\nat Dayton, Ohio. Here and there his story was\ntouched with moments of beauty intermingled with\nstrings of vile curses. The operator had married the\ndaughter of a dentist who was the youngest of three\nsisters. On his marriage day, because of his ability,\nhe was promoted to a position as dispatcher at an\nincreased salary and sent to an office at Columbus,\nOhio. There he settled down with his young wife\nand began buying a house on the installment plan.\n\nThe young telegraph operator was madly in love.\nWith a kind of religious fervor he had managed to\ngo through the pitfalls of his youth and to remain\nvirginal until after his marriage. He made for George\nWillard a picture of his life in the house at Colum-\nbus, Ohio, with the young wife. ""in the garden back\nof our house we planted vegetables,"" he said, ""you\nknow, peas and corn and such things. We went to\nColumbus in early March and as soon as the days\nbecame warm I went to work in the garden. With a\nspade I turned up the black ground while she ran\nabout laughing and pretending to be afraid of the\nworms I uncovered. Late in April came the planting.\nIn the little paths among the seed beds she stood\nholding a paper bag in her hand. The bag was filled\nwith seeds. A few at a time she handed me the\nseeds that I might thrust them into the warm, soft\nground.""\n\nFor a moment there was a catch in the voice of\nthe man talking in the darkness. ""I loved her,"" he\nsaid. ""I don\'t claim not to be a fool. I love her yet.\nThere in the dusk in the spring evening I crawled\nalong the black ground to her feet and groveled be-\nfore her. I kissed her shoes and the ankles above\nher shoes. When the hem of her garment touched\nmy face I trembled. When after two years of that life\nI found she had managed to acquire three other lov-\ners who came regularly to our house when I was\naway at work, I didn\'t want to touch them or her.\nI just sent her home to her mother and said nothing.\nThere was nothing to say. I had four hundred dol-\nlars in the bank and I gave her that. I didn\'t ask her\nreasons. I didn\'t say anything. When she had gone\nI cried like a silly boy. Pretty soon I had a chance\nto sell the house and I sent that money to her.""\n\nWash Williams and George Willard arose from the\npile of railroad ties and walked along the tracks\ntoward town. The operator finished his tale quickly,\nbreathlessly.\n\n""Her mother sent for me,"" he said. ""She wrote\nme a letter and asked me to come to their house at\nDayton. When I got there it was evening about this\ntime.""\n\nWash Williams\' voice rose to a half scream. ""I sat\nin the parlor of that house two hours. Her mother\ntook me in there and left me. Their house was styl-\nish. They were what is called respectable people.\nThere were plush chairs and a couch in the room. I\nwas trembling all over. I hated the men I thought\nhad wronged her. I was sick of living alone and\nwanted her back. The longer I waited the more raw\nand tender I became. I thought that if she came in\nand just touched me with her hand I would perhaps\nfaint away. I ached to forgive and forget.""\n\nWash Williams stopped and stood staring at George\nWillard. The boy\'s body shook as from a chill. Again\nthe man\'s voice became soft and low. ""She came\ninto the room naked,"" he went on. ""Her mother did\nthat. While I sat there she was taking the girl\'s\nclothes off, perhaps coaxing her to do it. First I\nheard voices at the door that led into a little hallway\nand then it opened softly. The girl was ashamed and\nstood perfectly still staring at the floor. The mother\ndidn\'t come into the room. When she had pushed\nthe girl in through the door she stood in the hallway\nwaiting, hoping we would--well, you see--\nwaiting.""\n\nGeorge Willard and the telegraph operator came\ninto the main street of Winesburg. The lights from\nthe store windows lay bright and shining on the\nsidewalks. People moved about laughing and talk-\ning. The young reporter felt ill and weak. In imagi-\nnation, he also became old and shapeless. ""I didn\'t\nget the mother killed,"" said Wash Williams, staring\nup and down the street. ""I struck her once with a\nchair and then the neighbors came in and took it\naway. She screamed so loud you see. I won\'t ever\nhave a chance to kill her now. She died of a fever a\nmonth after that happened.""\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\nTHE HOUSE in which Seth Richmond of Winesburg\nlived with his mother had been at one time the show\nplace of the town, but when young Seth lived there\nits glory had become somewhat dimmed. The huge\nbrick house which Banker White had built on Buck-\neye Street had overshadowed it. The Richmond\nplace was in a little valley far out at the end of Main\nStreet. Farmers coming into town by a dusty road\nfrom the south passed by a grove of walnut trees,\nskirted the Fair Ground with its high board fence\ncovered with advertisements, and trotted their horses\ndown through the valley past the Richmond place\ninto town. As much of the country north and south\nof Winesburg was devoted to fruit and berry raising,\nSeth saw wagon-loads of berry pickers--boys, girls,\nand women--going to the fields in the morning and\nreturning covered with dust in the evening. The\nchattering crowd, with their rude jokes cried out\nfrom wagon to wagon, sometimes irritated him\nsharply. He regretted that he also could not laugh\nboisterously, shout meaningless jokes and make of\nhimself a figure in the endless stream of moving,\ngiggling activity that went up and down the road.\n\nThe Richmond house was built of limestone, and,\nalthough it was said in the village to have become\nrun down, had in reality grown more beautiful with\nevery passing year. Already time had begun a little\nto color the stone, lending a golden richness to its\nsurface and in the evening or on dark days touching\nthe shaded places beneath the eaves with wavering\npatches of browns and blacks.\n\nThe house had been built by Seth\'s grandfather,\na stone quarryman, and it, together with the stone\nquarries on Lake Erie eighteen miles to the north,\nhad been left to his son, Clarence Richmond, Seth\'s\nfather. Clarence Richmond, a quiet passionate man\nextraordinarily admired by his neighbors, had been\nkilled in a street fight with the editor of a newspaper\nin Toledo, Ohio. The fight concerned the publication\nof Clarence Richmond\'s name coupled with that of\na woman school teacher, and as the dead man had\nbegun the row by firing upon the editor, the effort\nto punish the slayer was unsuccessful. After the\nquarryman\'s death it was found that much of the\nmoney left to him had been squandered in specula-\ntion and in insecure investments made through the\ninfluence of friends.\n\nLeft with but a small income, Virginia Richmond\nhad settled down to a retired life in the village and\nto the raising of her son. Although she had been\ndeeply moved by the death of the husband and fa-\nther, she did not at all believe the stories concerning\nhim that ran about after his death. To her mind,\nthe sensitive, boyish man whom all had instinctively\nloved, was but an unfortunate, a being too fine for\neveryday life. ""You\'ll be hearing all sorts of stories,\nbut you are not to believe what you hear,"" she said\nto her son. ""He was a good man, full of tenderness\nfor everyone, and should not have tried to be a man\nof affairs. No matter how much I were to plan and\ndream of your future, I could not imagine anything\nbetter for you than that you turn out as good a man\nas your father.""\n\nSeveral years after the death of her husband, Vir-\nginia Richmond had become alarmed at the growing\ndemands upon her income and had set herself to\nthe task of increasing it. She had learned stenogra-\nphy and through the influence of her husband\'s\nfriends got the position of court stenographer at the\ncounty seat. There she went by train each morning\nduring the sessions of the court, and when no court\nsat, spent her days working among the rosebushes\nin her garden. She was a tall, straight figure of a\nwoman with a plain face and a great mass of brown\nhair.\n\nIn the relationship between Seth Richmond and\nhis mother, there was a quality that even at eighteen\nhad begun to color all of his traffic with men. An\nalmost unhealthy respect for the youth kept the\nmother for the most part silent in his presence.\nWhen she did speak sharply to him he had only to\nlook steadily into her eyes to see dawning there the\npuzzled look he had already noticed in the eyes of\nothers when he looked at them.\n\nThe truth was that the son thought with remark-\nable clearness and the mother did not. She expected\nfrom all people certain conventional reactions to life.\nA boy was your son, you scolded him and he trem-\nbled and looked at the floor. When you had scolded\nenough he wept and all was forgiven. After the\nweeping and when he had gone to bed, you crept\ninto his room and kissed him.\n\nVirginia Richmond could not understand why her\nson did not do these things. After the severest repri-\nmand, he did not tremble and look at the floor but\ninstead looked steadily at her, causing uneasy doubts\nto invade her mind. As for creeping into his room--\nafter Seth had passed his fifteenth year, she would\nhave been half afraid to do anything of the kind.\n\nOnce when he was a boy of sixteen, Seth in com-\npany with two other boys ran away from home. The\nthree boys climbed into the open door of an empty\nfreight car and rode some forty miles to a town\nwhere a fair was being held. One of the boys had\na bottle filled with a combination of whiskey and\nblackberry wine, and the three sat with legs dan-\ngling out of the car door drinking from the bottle.\nSeth\'s two companions sang and waved their hands\nto idlers about the stations of the towns through\nwhich the train passed. They planned raids upon\nthe baskets of farmers who had come with their fam-\nilies to the fair. ""We will five like kings and won\'t\nhave to spend a penny to see the fair and horse\nraces,"" they declared boastfully.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Seth, Virginia Rich-\nmond walked up and down the floor of her home\nfilled with vague alarms. Although on the next day\nshe discovered, through an inquiry made by the\ntown marshal, on what adventure the boys had\ngone, she could not quiet herself. All through the\nnight she lay awake hearing the clock tick and telling\nherself that Seth, like his father, would come to a\nsudden and violent end. So determined was she that\nthe boy should this time feel the weight of her wrath\nthat, although she would not allow the marshal to\ninterfere with his adventure, she got out a pencil\nand paper and wrote down a series of sharp, sting-\ning reproofs she intended to pour out upon him.\nThe reproofs she committed to memory, going about\nthe garden and saying them aloud like an actor\nmemorizing his part.\n\nAnd when, at the end of the week, Seth returned,\na little weary and with coal soot in his ears and\nabout his eyes, she again found herself unable to\nreprove him. Walking into the house he hung his\ncap on a nail by the kitchen door and stood looking\nsteadily at her. ""I wanted to turn back within an\nhour after we had started,"" he explained. ""I didn\'t\nknow what to do. I knew you would be bothered,\nbut I knew also that if I didn\'t go on I would be\nashamed of myself. I went through with the thing\nfor my own good. It was uncomfortable, sleeping\non wet straw, and two drunken Negroes came and\nslept with us. When I stole a lunch basket out of a\nfarmer\'s wagon I couldn\'t help thinking of his chil-\ndren going all day without food. I was sick of the\nwhole affair, but I was determined to stick it out\nuntil the other boys were ready to come back.""\n\n""I\'m glad you did stick it out,"" replied the mother,\nhalf resentfully, and kissing him upon the forehead\npretended to busy herself with the work about the\nhouse.\n\nOn a summer evening Seth Richmond went to\nthe New Willard House to visit his friend, George\nWillard. It had rained during the afternoon, but as\nhe walked through Main Street, the sky had partially\ncleared and a golden glow lit up the west. Going\naround a corner, he turned in at the door of the\nhotel and began to climb the stairway leading up to\nhis friend\'s room. In the hotel office the proprietor\nand two traveling men were engaged in a discussion\nof politics.\n\nOn the stairway Seth stopped and listened to the\nvoices of the men below. They were excited and\ntalked rapidly. Tom Willard was berating the travel-\ning men. ""I am a Democrat but your talk makes\nme sick,"" he said. ""You don\'t understand McKinley.\nMcKinley and Mark Hanna are friends. It is impossi-\nble perhaps for your mind to grasp that. If anyone\ntells you that a friendship can be deeper and bigger\nand more worth while than dollars and cents, or\neven more worth while than state politics, you\nsnicker and laugh.""\n\nThe landlord was interrupted by one of the\nguests, a tall, grey-mustached man who worked for\na wholesale grocery house. ""Do you think that I\'ve\nlived in Cleveland all these years without knowing\nMark Hanna?"" he demanded. ""Your talk is piffle.\nHanna is after money and nothing else. This McKin-\nley is his tool. He has McKinley bluffed and don\'t\nyou forget it.""\n\nThe young man on the stairs did not linger to\nhear the rest of the discussion, but went on up the\nstairway and into the little dark hall. Something in\nthe voices of the men talking in the hotel office\nstarted a chain of thoughts in his mind. He was\nlonely and had begun to think that loneliness was a\npart of his character, something that would always\nstay with him. Stepping into a side hall he stood by\na window that looked into an alleyway. At the back\nof his shop stood Abner Groff, the town baker. His\ntiny bloodshot eyes looked up and down the alley-\nway. In his shop someone called the baker, who\npretended not to hear. The baker had an empty milk\nbottle in his hand and an angry sullen look in his\neyes.\n\nIn Winesburg, Seth Richmond was called the\n""deep one."" ""He\'s like his father,"" men said as he\nwent through the streets. ""He\'ll break out some of\nthese days. You wait and see.""\n\nThe talk of the town and the respect with which\nmen and boys instinctively greeted him, as all men\ngreet silent people, had affected Seth Richmond\'s\noutlook on life and on himself. He, like most boys,\nwas deeper than boys are given credit for being, but\nhe was not what the men of the town, and even\nhis mother, thought him to be. No great underlying\npurpose lay back of his habitual silence, and he had\nno definite plan for his life. When the boys with\nwhom he associated were noisy and quarrelsome,\nhe stood quietly at one side. With calm eyes he\nwatched the gesticulating lively figures of his com-\npanions. He wasn\'t particularly interested in what\nwas going on, and sometimes wondered if he would\never be particularly interested in anything. Now, as\nhe stood in the half-darkness by the window watch-\ning the baker, he wished that he himself might be-\ncome thoroughly stirred by something, even by the\nfits of sullen anger for which Baker Groff was noted.\n""It would be better for me if I could become excited\nand wrangle about politics like windy old Tom Wil-\nlard,"" he thought, as he left the window and went\nagain along the hallway to the room occupied by his\nfriend, George Willard.\n\nGeorge Willard was older than Seth Richmond,\nbut in the rather odd friendship between the two, it\nwas he who was forever courting and the younger\nboy who was being courted. The paper on which\nGeorge worked had one policy. It strove to mention\nby name in each issue, as many as possible of the\ninhabitants of the village. Like an excited dog,\nGeorge Willard ran here and there, noting on his\npad of paper who had gone on business to the\ncounty seat or had returned from a visit to a neigh-\nboring village. All day he wrote little facts upon the\npad. ""A. P. Wringlet had received a shipment of\nstraw hats. Ed Byerbaum and Tom Marshall were in\nCleveland Friday. Uncle Tom Sinnings is building a\nnew barn on his place on the Valley Road.""\n\nThe idea that George Willard would some day be-\ncome a writer had given him a place of distinction\nin Winesburg, and to Seth Richmond he talked con-\ntinually of the matter, ""It\'s the easiest of all lives to\nlive,"" he declared, becoming excited and boastful.\n""Here and there you go and there is no one to boss\nyou. Though you are in India or in the South Seas\nin a boat, you have but to write and there you are.\nWait till I get my name up and then see what fun I\nshall have.""\n\nIn George Willard\'s room, which had a window\nlooking down into an alleyway and one that looked\nacross railroad tracks to Biff Carter\'s Lunch Room\nfacing the railroad station, Seth Richmond sat in a\nchair and looked at the floor. George Willard, who\nhad been sitting for an hour idly playing with a lead\npencil, greeted him effusively. ""I\'ve been trying to\nwrite a love story,"" he explained, laughing ner-\nvously. Lighting a pipe he began walking up and\ndown the room. ""I know what I\'m going to do. I\'m\ngoing to fall in love. I\'ve been sitting here and think-\ning it over and I\'m going to do it.""\n\nAs though embarrassed by his declaration, George\nwent to a window and turning his back to his friend\nleaned out. ""I know who I\'m going to fall in love\nwith,"" he said sharply. ""It\'s Helen White. She is the\nonly girl in town with any \'get-up\' to her.""\n\nStruck with a new idea, young Willard turned and\nwalked toward his visitor. ""Look here,"" he said.\n""You know Helen White better than I do. I want\nyou to tell her what I said. You just get to talking\nto her and say that I\'m in love with her. See what\nshe says to that. See how she takes it, and then you\ncome and tell me.""\n\nSeth Richmond arose and went toward the door.\nThe words of his comrade irritated him unbearably.\n""Well, good-bye,"" he said briefly.\n\nGeorge was amazed. Running forward he stood\nin the darkness trying to look into Seth\'s face.\n""What\'s the matter? What are you going to do? You\nstay here and let\'s talk,"" he urged.\n\nA wave of resentment directed against his friend,\nthe men of the town who were, he thought, perpet-\nually talking of nothing, and most of all, against his\nown habit of silence, made Seth half desperate.\n""Aw, speak to her yourself,"" he burst forth and\nthen, going quickly through the door, slammed it\nsharply in his friend\'s face. ""I\'m going to find Helen\nWhite and talk to her, but not about him,"" he\nmuttered.\n\nSeth went down the stairway and out at the front\ndoor of the hotel muttering with wrath. Crossing a\nlittle dusty street and climbing a low iron railing, he\nwent to sit upon the grass in the station yard.\nGeorge Willard he thought a profound fool, and he\nwished that he had said so more vigorously. Al-\nthough his acquaintanceship with Helen White, the\nbanker\'s daughter, was outwardly but casual, she\nwas often the subject of his thoughts and he felt that\nshe was something private and personal to himself.\n""The busy fool with his love stories,"" he muttered,\nstaring back over his shoulder at George Willard\'s\nroom, ""why does he never tire of his eternal\ntalking.""\n\nIt was berry harvest time in Winesburg and upon\nthe station platform men and boys loaded the boxes\nof red, fragrant berries into two express cars that\nstood upon the siding. A June moon was in the sky,\nalthough in the west a storm threatened, and no\nstreet lamps were lighted. In the dim light the fig-\nures of the men standing upon the express truck\nand pitching the boxes in at the doors of the cars\nwere but dimly discernible. Upon the iron railing\nthat protected the station lawn sat other men. Pipes\nwere lighted. Village jokes went back and forth.\nAway in the distance a train whistled and the men\nloading the boxes into the cars worked with re-\nnewed activity.\n\nSeth arose from his place on the grass and went\nsilently past the men perched upon the railing and\ninto Main Street. He had come to a resolution. ""I\'ll\nget out of here,"" he told himself. ""What good am I\nhere? I\'m going to some city and go to work. I\'ll tell\nmother about it tomorrow.""\n\nSeth Richmond went slowly along Main Street,\npast Wacker\'s Cigar Store and the Town Hall, and\ninto Buckeye Street. He was depressed by the\nthought that he was not a part of the life in his own\ntown, but the depression did not cut deeply as he\ndid not think of himself as at fault. In the heavy\nshadows of a big tree before Doctor Welling\'s house,\nhe stopped and stood watching half-witted Turk\nSmollet, who was pushing a wheelbarrow in the\nroad. The old man with his absurdly boyish mind\nhad a dozen long boards on the wheelbarrow, and,\nas he hurried along the road, balanced the load with\nextreme nicety. ""Easy there, Turk! Steady now, old\nboy!"" the old man shouted to himself, and laughed\nso that the load of boards rocked dangerously.\n\nSeth knew Turk Smollet, the half dangerous old\nwood chopper whose peculiarities added so much\nof color to the life of the village. He knew that when\nTurk got into Main Street he would become the cen-\nter of a whirlwind of cries and comments, that in\ntruth the old man was going far out of his way in\norder to pass through Main Street and exhibit his\nskill in wheeling the boards. ""If George Willard were\nhere, he\'d have something to say,"" thought Seth.\n""George belongs to this town. He\'d shout at Turk\nand Turk would shout at him. They\'d both be se-\ncretly pleased by what they had said. It\'s different\nwith me. I don\'t belong. I\'ll not make a fuss about\nit, but I\'m going to get out of here.""\n\nSeth stumbled forward through the half-darkness,\nfeeling himself an outcast in his own town. He\nbegan to pity himself, but a sense of the absurdity\nof his thoughts made him smile. In the end he de-\ncided that he was simply old beyond his years and\nnot at all a subject for self-pity. ""I\'m made to go to\nwork. I may be able to make a place for myself by\nsteady working, and I might as well be at it,"" he\ndecided.\n\nSeth went to the house of Banker White and stood\nin the darkness by the front door. On the door hung\na heavy brass knocker, an innovation introduced\ninto the village by Helen White\'s mother, who had\nalso organized a women\'s club for the study of po-\netry. Seth raised the knocker and let it fall. Its heavy\nclatter sounded like a report from distant guns.\n""How awkward and foolish I am,"" he thought. ""If\nMrs. White comes to the door, I won\'t know what\nto say.""\n\nIt was Helen White who came to the door and\nfound Seth standing at the edge of the porch. Blush-\ning with pleasure, she stepped forward, closing the\ndoor softly. ""I\'m going to get out of town. I don\'t\nknow what I\'ll do, but I\'m going to get out of here\nand go to work. I think I\'ll go to Columbus,"" he\nsaid. ""Perhaps I\'ll get into the State University down\nthere. Anyway, I\'m going. I\'ll tell mother tonight.""\nHe hesitated and looked doubtfully about. ""Perhaps\nyou wouldn\'t mind coming to walk with me?""\n\nSeth and Helen walked through the streets be-\nneath the trees. Heavy clouds had drifted across the\nface of the moon, and before them in the deep twi-\nlight went a man with a short ladder upon his shoul-\nder. Hurrying forward, the man stopped at the\nstreet crossing and, putting the ladder against the\nwooden lamp-post, lighted the village lights so that\ntheir way was half lighted, half darkened, by the\nlamps and by the deepening shadows cast by the\nlow-branched trees. In the tops of the trees the wind\nbegan to play, disturbing the sleeping birds so that\nthey flew about calling plaintively. In the lighted\nspace before one of the lamps, two bats wheeled\nand circled, pursuing the gathering swarm of night\nflies.\n\nSince Seth had been a boy in knee trousers there\nhad been a half expressed intimacy between him\nand the maiden who now for the first time walked\nbeside him. For a time she had been beset with a\nmadness for writing notes which she addressed to\nSeth. He had found them concealed in his books at\nschool and one had been given him by a child met\nin the street, while several had been delivered\nthrough the village post office.\n\nThe notes had been written in a round, boyish\nhand and had reflected a mind inflamed by novel\nreading. Seth had not answered them, although he\nhad been moved and flattered by some of the sen-\ntences scrawled in pencil upon the stationery of the\nbanker\'s wife. Putting them into the pocket of his\ncoat, he went through the street or stood by the\nfence in the school yard with something burning at\nhis side. He thought it fine that he should be thus\nselected as the favorite of the richest and most at-\ntractive girl in town.\n\nHelen and Seth stopped by a fence near where a\nlow dark building faced the street. The building had\nonce been a factory for the making of barrel staves\nbut was now vacant. Across the street upon the\nporch of a house a man and woman talked of their\nchildhood, their voices coming dearly across to the\nhalf-embarrassed youth and maiden. There was the\nsound of scraping chairs and the man and woman\ncame down the gravel path to a wooden gate. Stand-\ning outside the gate, the man leaned over and kissed\nthe woman. ""For old times\' sake,"" he said and,\nturning, walked rapidly away along the sidewalk.\n\n""That\'s Belle Turner,"" whispered Helen, and put\nher hand boldly into Seth\'s hand. ""I didn\'t know\nshe had a fellow. I thought she was too old for\nthat."" Seth laughed uneasily. The hand of the girl\nwas warm and a strange, dizzy feeling crept over\nhim. Into his mind came a desire to tell her some-\nthing he had been determined not to tell. ""George\nWillard\'s in love with you,"" he said, and in spite of\nhis agitation his voice was low and quiet. ""He\'s writ-\ning a story, and he wants to be in love. He wants\nto know how it feels. He wanted me to tell you and\nsee what you said.""\n\nAgain Helen and Seth walked in silence. They\ncame to the garden surrounding the old Richmond\nplace and going through a gap in the hedge sat on\na wooden bench beneath a bush.\n\nOn the street as he walked beside the girl new\nand daring thoughts had come into Seth Richmond\'s\nmind. He began to regret his decision to get out of\ntown. ""It would be something new and altogether\ndelightful to remain and walk often through the\nstreets with Helen White,"" he thought. In imagina-\ntion he saw himself putting his arm about her waist\nand feeling her arms clasped tightly about his neck.\nOne of those odd combinations of events and places\nmade him connect the idea of love-making with this\ngirl and a spot he had visited some days before. He\nhad gone on an errand to the house of a farmer who\nlived on a hillside beyond the Fair Ground and had\nreturned by a path through a field. At the foot of\nthe hill below the farmer\'s house Seth had stopped\nbeneath a sycamore tree and looked about him. A\nsoft humming noise had greeted his ears. For a mo-\nment he had thought the tree must be the home of\na swarm of bees.\n\nAnd then, looking down, Seth had seen the bees\neverywhere all about him in the long grass. He\nstood in a mass of weeds that grew waist-high in\nthe field that ran away from the hillside. The weeds\nwere abloom with tiny purple blossoms and gave\nforth an overpowering fragrance. Upon the weeds\nthe bees were gathered in armies, singing as they\nworked.\n\nSeth imagined himself lying on a summer eve-\nning, buried deep among the weeds beneath the\ntree. Beside him, in the scene built in his fancy, lay\nHelen White, her hand lying in his hand. A peculiar\nreluctance kept him from kissing her lips, but he felt\nhe might have done that if he wished. Instead, he\nlay perfectly still, looking at her and listening to the\narmy of bees that sang the sustained masterful song\nof labor above his head.\n\nOn the bench in the garden Seth stirred uneasily.\nReleasing the hand of the girl, he thrust his hands\ninto his trouser pockets. A desire to impress the\nmind of his companion with the importance of the\nresolution he had made came over him and he nod-\nded his head toward the house. ""Mother\'ll make a\nfuss, I suppose,"" he whispered. ""She hasn\'t thought\nat all about what I\'m going to do in life. She thinks\nI\'m going to stay on here forever just being a boy.""\n\nSeth\'s voice became charged with boyish earnest-\nness. ""You see, I\'ve got to strike out. I\'ve got to get\nto work. It\'s what I\'m good for.""\n\nHelen White was impressed. She nodded her\nhead and a feeling of admiration swept over her.\n""This is as it should be,"" she thought. ""This boy is\nnot a boy at all, but a strong, purposeful man."" Cer-\ntain vague desires that had been invading her body\nwere swept away and she sat up very straight on\nthe bench. The thunder continued to rumble and\nflashes of heat lightning lit up the eastern sky. The\ngarden that had been so mysterious and vast, a\nplace that with Seth beside her might have become\nthe background for strange and wonderful adven-\ntures, now seemed no more than an ordinary Wines-\nburg back yard, quite definite and limited in its\noutlines.\n\n""What will you do up there?"" she whispered.\n\nSeth turned half around on the bench, striving to\nsee her face in the darkness. He thought her infi-\nnitely more sensible and straightforward than George\nWillard, and was glad he had come away from his\nfriend. A feeling of impatience with the town that\nhad been in his mind returned, and he tried to tell\nher of it. ""Everyone talks and talks,"" he began. ""I\'m\nsick of it. I\'ll do something, get into some kind of\nwork where talk don\'t count. Maybe I\'ll just be a\nmechanic in a shop. I don\'t know. I guess I don\'t\ncare much. I just want to work and keep quiet.\nThat\'s all I\'ve got in my mind.""\n\nSeth arose from the bench and put out his hand.\nHe did not want to bring the meeting to an end but\ncould not think of anything more to say. ""It\'s the\nlast time we\'ll see each other,"" he whispered.\n\nA wave of sentiment swept over Helen. Putting\nher hand upon Seth\'s shoulder, she started to draw\nhis face down toward her own upturned face. The\nact was one of pure affection and cutting regret that\nsome vague adventure that had been present in the\nspirit of the night would now never be realized. ""I\nthink I\'d better be going along,"" she said, letting her\nhand fall heavily to her side. A thought came to her.\n""Don\'t you go with me; I want to be alone,"" she\nsaid. ""You go and talk with your mother. You\'d\nbetter do that now.""\n\nSeth hesitated and, as he stood waiting, the girl\nturned and ran away through the hedge. A desire\nto run after her came to him, but he only stood\nstaring, perplexed and puzzled by her action as he\nhad been perplexed and puzzled by all of the life of\nthe town out of which she had come. Walking\nslowly toward the house, he stopped in the shadow\nof a large tree and looked at his mother sitting by a\nlighted window busily sewing. The feeling of loneli-\nness that had visited him earlier in the evening re-\nturned and colored his thoughts of the adventure\nthrough which he had just passed. ""Huh!"" he ex-\nclaimed, turning and staring in the direction taken\nby Helen White. ""That\'s how things\'ll turn out.\nShe\'ll be like the rest. I suppose she\'ll begin now to\nlook at me in a funny way."" He looked at the\nground and pondered this thought. ""She\'ll be em-\nbarrassed and feel strange when I\'m around,"" he\nwhispered to himself. ""That\'s how it\'ll be. That\'s\nhow everything\'ll turn out. When it comes to loving\nsomeone, it won\'t never be me. It\'ll be someone\nelse--some fool--someone who talks a lot--some-\none like that George Willard.""\n\n\n\n\n']"
My Antonia: Book I Chapter IV,"Jim learns to ride one of his grandparents’ horses, and he becomes the messenger for the family. As the messenger, with the freedom of travel that he has with the horse, he becomes a sightseer, traveling about the area to admire the landscapes. He also instructs Ántonia in English every day. She runs across the prairie between them, and Jim shares some of the watermelon from the farm with her. Jim also notices the ways that the rattlesnakes take advantage of the prairie dogs in the area, and compares Krajiek to a rattlesnake in a prairie dog town. The Shimerdas don’t know how to get rid of their only English-speaking Bohemian companion. ",My Antonia,Book I Chapter IV," ON THE AFTERNOON of that same Sunday I took my first long ride on my pony, under Otto's direction. After that Dude and I went twice a week to the post-office, six miles east of us, and I saved the men a good deal of time by riding on errands to our neighbours. When we had to borrow anything, or to send about word that there would be preaching at the sod schoolhouse, I was always the messenger. Formerly Fuchs attended to such things after working hours. All the years that have passed have not dimmed my memory of that first glorious autumn. The new country lay open before me: there were no fences in those days, and I could choose my own way over the grass uplands, trusting the pony to get me home again. Sometimes I followed the sunflower-bordered roads. Fuchs told me that the sunflowers were introduced into that country by the Mormons; that at the time of the persecution, when they left Missouri and struck out into the wilderness to find a place where they could worship God in their own way, the members of the first exploring party, crossing the plains to Utah, scattered sunflower seed as they went. The next summer, when the long trains of wagons came through with all the women and children, they had the sunflower trail to follow. I believe that botanists do not confirm Fuchs's story, but insist that the sunflower was native to those plains. Nevertheless, that legend has stuck in my mind, and sunflower-bordered roads always seem to me the roads to freedom. I used to love to drift along the pale-yellow cornfields, looking for the damp spots one sometimes found at their edges, where the smartweed soon turned a rich copper colour and the narrow brown leaves hung curled like cocoons about the swollen joints of the stem. Sometimes I went south to visit our German neighbours and to admire their catalpa grove, or to see the big elm tree that grew up out of a deep crack in the earth and had a hawk's nest in its branches. Trees were so rare in that country, and they had to make such a hard fight to grow, that we used to feel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons. It must have been the scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made detail so precious. Sometimes I rode north to the big prairie-dog town to watch the brown earth-owls fly home in the late afternoon and go down to their nests underground with the dogs. Antonia Shimerda liked to go with me, and we used to wonder a great deal about these birds of subterranean habit. We had to be on our guard there, for rattlesnakes were always lurking about. They came to pick up an easy living among the dogs and owls, which were quite defenceless against them; took possession of their comfortable houses and ate the eggs and puppies. We felt sorry for the owls. It was always mournful to see them come flying home at sunset and disappear under the earth. But, after all, we felt, winged things who would live like that must be rather degraded creatures. The dog-town was a long way from any pond or creek. Otto Fuchs said he had seen populous dog-towns in the desert where there was no surface water for fifty miles; he insisted that some of the holes must go down to water--nearly two hundred feet, hereabouts. Antonia said she didn't believe it; that the dogs probably lapped up the dew in the early morning, like the rabbits. Antonia had opinions about everything, and she was soon able to make them known. Almost every day she came running across the prairie to have her reading lesson with me. Mrs. Shimerda grumbled, but realized it was important that one member of the family should learn English. When the lesson was over, we used to go up to the watermelon patch behind the garden. I split the melons with an old corn-knife, and we lifted out the hearts and ate them with the juice trickling through our fingers. The white Christmas melons we did not touch, but we watched them with curiosity. They were to be picked late, when the hard frosts had set in, and put away for winter use. After weeks on the ocean, the Shimerdas were famished for fruit. The two girls would wander for miles along the edge of the cornfields, hunting for ground-cherries. Antonia loved to help grandmother in the kitchen and to learn about cooking and housekeeping. She would stand beside her, watching her every movement. We were willing to believe that Mrs. Shimerda was a good housewife in her own country, but she managed poorly under new conditions: the conditions were bad enough, certainly! I remember how horrified we were at the sour, ashy-grey bread she gave her family to eat. She mixed her dough, we discovered, in an old tin peck-measure that Krajiek had used about the barn. When she took the paste out to bake it, she left smears of dough sticking to the sides of the measure, put the measure on the shelf behind the stove, and let this residue ferment. The next time she made bread, she scraped this sour stuff down into the fresh dough to serve as yeast. During those first months the Shimerdas never went to town. Krajiek encouraged them in the belief that in Black Hawk they would somehow be mysteriously separated from their money. They hated Krajiek, but they clung to him because he was the only human being with whom they could talk or from whom they could get information. He slept with the old man and the two boys in the dugout barn, along with the oxen. They kept him in their hole and fed him for the same reason that the prairie-dogs and the brown owls house the rattlesnakes-- because they did not know how to get rid of him.  V WE KNEW THAT THINGS were hard for our Bohemian neighbours, but the two girls were lighthearted and never complained. They were always ready to forget their troubles at home, and to run away with me over the prairie, scaring rabbits or starting up flocks of quail. I remember Antonia's excitement when she came into our kitchen one afternoon and announced: `My papa find friends up north, with Russian mans. Last night he take me for see, and I can understand very much talk. Nice mans, Mrs. Burden. One is fat and all the time laugh. Everybody laugh. The first time I see my papa laugh in this kawntree. Oh, very nice!' I asked her if she meant the two Russians who lived up by the big dog-town. I had often been tempted to go to see them when I was riding in that direction, but one of them was a wild-looking fellow and I was a little afraid of him. Russia seemed to me more remote than any other country-- farther away than China, almost as far as the North Pole. Of all the strange, uprooted people among the first settlers, those two men were the strangest and the most aloof. Their last names were unpronounceable, so they were called Pavel and Peter. They went about making signs to people, and until the Shimerdas came they had no friends. Krajiek could understand them a little, but he had cheated them in a trade, so they avoided him. Pavel, the tall one, was said to be an anarchist; since he had no means of imparting his opinions, probably his wild gesticulations and his generally excited and rebellious manner gave rise to this supposition. He must once have been a very strong man, but now his great frame, with big, knotty joints, had a wasted look, and the skin was drawn tight over his high cheekbones. His breathing was hoarse, and he always had a cough. Peter, his companion, was a very different sort of fellow; short, bow-legged, and as fat as butter. He always seemed pleased when he met people on the road, smiled and took off his cap to everyone, men as well as women. At a distance, on his wagon, he looked like an old man; his hair and beard were of such a pale flaxen colour that they seemed white in the sun. They were as thick and curly as carded wool. His rosy face, with its snub nose, set in this fleece, was like a melon among its leaves. He was usually called `Curly Peter,' or `Rooshian Peter.' The two Russians made good farm-hands, and in summer they worked out together. I had heard our neighbours laughing when they told how Peter always had to go home at night to milk his cow. Other bachelor homesteaders used canned milk, to save trouble. Sometimes Peter came to church at the sod schoolhouse. It was there I first saw him, sitting on a low bench by the door, his plush cap in his hands, his bare feet tucked apologetically under the seat. After Mr. Shimerda discovered the Russians, he went to see them almost every evening, and sometimes took Antonia with him. She said they came from a part of Russia where the language was not very different from Bohemian, and if I wanted to go to their place, she could talk to them for me. One afternoon, before the heavy frosts began, we rode up there together on my pony. The Russians had a neat log house built on a grassy slope, with a windlass well beside the door. As we rode up the draw, we skirted a big melon patch, and a garden where squashes and yellow cucumbers lay about on the sod. We found Peter out behind his kitchen, bending over a washtub. He was working so hard that he did not hear us coming. His whole body moved up and down as he rubbed, and he was a funny sight from the rear, with his shaggy head and bandy legs. When he straightened himself up to greet us, drops of perspiration were rolling from his thick nose down onto his curly beard. Peter dried his hands and seemed glad to leave his washing. He took us down to see his chickens, and his cow that was grazing on the hillside. He told Antonia that in his country only rich people had cows, but here any man could have one who would take care of her. The milk was good for Pavel, who was often sick, and he could make butter by beating sour cream with a wooden spoon. Peter was very fond of his cow. He patted her flanks and talked to her in Russian while he pulled up her lariat pin and set it in a new place. After he had shown us his garden, Peter trundled a load of watermelons up the hill in his wheelbarrow. Pavel was not at home. He was off somewhere helping to dig a well. The house I thought very comfortable for two men who were `batching.' Besides the kitchen, there was a living-room, with a wide double bed built against the wall, properly made up with blue gingham sheets and pillows. There was a little storeroom, too, with a window, where they kept guns and saddles and tools, and old coats and boots. That day the floor was covered with garden things, drying for winter; corn and beans and fat yellow cucumbers. There were no screens or window-blinds in the house, and all the doors and windows stood wide open, letting in flies and sunshine alike. Peter put the melons in a row on the oilcloth-covered table and stood over them, brandishing a butcher knife. Before the blade got fairly into them, they split of their own ripeness, with a delicious sound. He gave us knives, but no plates, and the top of the table was soon swimming with juice and seeds. I had never seen anyone eat so many melons as Peter ate. He assured us that they were good for one--better than medicine; in his country people lived on them at this time of year. He was very hospitable and jolly. Once, while he was looking at Antonia, he sighed and told us that if he had stayed at home in Russia perhaps by this time he would have had a pretty daughter of his own to cook and keep house for him. He said he had left his country because of a `great trouble.' When we got up to go, Peter looked about in perplexity for something that would entertain us. He ran into the storeroom and brought out a gaudily painted harmonica, sat down on a bench, and spreading his fat legs apart began to play like a whole band. The tunes were either very lively or very doleful, and he sang words to some of them. Before we left, Peter put ripe cucumbers into a sack for Mrs. Shimerda and gave us a lard-pail full of milk to cook them in. I had never heard of cooking cucumbers, but Antonia assured me they were very good. We had to walk the pony all the way home to keep from spilling the milk.  VI ONE AFTERNOON WE WERE having our reading lesson on the warm, grassy bank where the badger lived. It was a day of amber sunlight, but there was a shiver of coming winter in the air. I had seen ice on the little horsepond that morning, and as we went through the garden we found the tall asparagus, with its red berries, lying on the ground, a mass of slimy green. Tony was barefooted, and she shivered in her cotton dress and was comfortable only when we were tucked down on the baked earth, in the full blaze of the sun. She could talk to me about almost anything by this time. That afternoon she was telling me how highly esteemed our friend the badger was in her part of the world, and how men kept a special kind of dog, with very short legs, to hunt him. Those dogs, she said, went down into the hole after the badger and killed him there in a terrific struggle underground; you could hear the barks and yelps outside. Then the dog dragged himself back, covered with bites and scratches, to be rewarded and petted by his master. She knew a dog who had a star on his collar for every badger he had killed. The rabbits were unusually spry that afternoon. They kept starting up all about us, and dashing off down the draw as if they were playing a game of some kind. But the little buzzing things that lived in the grass were all dead--all but one. While we were lying there against the warm bank, a little insect of the palest, frailest green hopped painfully out of the buffalo grass and tried to leap into a bunch of bluestem. He missed it, fell back, and sat with his head sunk between his long legs, his antennae quivering, as if he were waiting for something to come and finish him. Tony made a warm nest for him in her hands; talked to him gaily and indulgently in Bohemian. Presently he began to sing for us--a thin, rusty little chirp. She held him close to her ear and laughed, but a moment afterward I saw there were tears in her eyes. She told me that in her village at home there was an old beggar woman who went about selling herbs and roots she had dug up in the forest. If you took her in and gave her a warm place by the fire, she sang old songs to the children in a cracked voice, like this. Old Hata, she was called, and the children loved to see her coming and saved their cakes and sweets for her. When the bank on the other side of the draw began to throw a narrow shelf of shadow, we knew we ought to be starting homeward; the chill came on quickly when the sun got low, and Antonia's dress was thin. What were we to do with the frail little creature we had lured back to life by false pretences? I offered my pockets, but Tony shook her head and carefully put the green insect in her hair, tying her big handkerchief down loosely over her curls. I said I would go with her until we could see Squaw Creek, and then turn and run home. We drifted along lazily, very happy, through the magical light of the late afternoon. All those fall afternoons were the same, but I never got used to them. As far as we could see, the miles of copper-red grass were drenched in sunlight that was stronger and fiercer than at any other time of the day. The blond cornfields were red gold, the haystacks turned rosy and threw long shadows. The whole prairie was like the bush that burned with fire and was not consumed. That hour always had the exultation of victory, of triumphant ending, like a hero's death--heroes who died young and gloriously. It was a sudden transfiguration, a lifting-up of day. How many an afternoon Antonia and I have trailed along the prairie under that magnificence! And always two long black shadows flitted before us or followed after, dark spots on the ruddy grass. We had been silent a long time, and the edge of the sun sank nearer and nearer the prairie floor, when we saw a figure moving on the edge of the upland, a gun over his shoulder. He was walking slowly, dragging his feet along as if he had no purpose. We broke into a run to overtake him. `My papa sick all the time,' Tony panted as we flew. `He not look good, Jim.' As we neared Mr. Shimerda she shouted, and he lifted his head and peered about. Tony ran up to him, caught his hand and pressed it against her cheek. She was the only one of his family who could rouse the old man from the torpor in which he seemed to live. He took the bag from his belt and showed us three rabbits he had shot, looked at Antonia with a wintry flicker of a smile and began to tell her something. She turned to me. `My tatinek make me little hat with the skins, little hat for winter!' she exclaimed joyfully. `Meat for eat, skin for hat'--she told off these benefits on her fingers. Her father put his hand on her hair, but she caught his wrist and lifted it carefully away, talking to him rapidly. I heard the name of old Hata. He untied the handkerchief, separated her hair with his fingers, and stood looking down at the green insect. When it began to chirp faintly, he listened as if it were a beautiful sound. I picked up the gun he had dropped; a queer piece from the old country, short and heavy, with a stag's head on the cock. When he saw me examining it, he turned to me with his far-away look that always made me feel as if I were down at the bottom of a well. He spoke kindly and gravely, and Antonia translated: `My tatinek say when you are big boy, he give you his gun. Very fine, from Bohemie. It was belong to a great man, very rich, like what you not got here; many fields, many forests, many big house. My papa play for his wedding, and he give my papa fine gun, and my papa give you.' I was glad that this project was one of futurity. There never were such people as the Shimerdas for wanting to give away everything they had. Even the mother was always offering me things, though I knew she expected substantial presents in return. We stood there in friendly silence, while the feeble minstrel sheltered in Antonia's hair went on with its scratchy chirp. The old man's smile, as he listened, was so full of sadness, of pity for things, that I never afterward forgot it. As the sun sank there came a sudden coolness and the strong smell of earth and drying grass. Antonia and her father went off hand in hand, and I buttoned up my jacket and raced my shadow home.  VII MUCH AS I LIKED Antonia, I hated a superior tone that she sometimes took with me. She was four years older than I, to be sure, and had seen more of the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her protecting manner. Before the autumn was over, she began to treat me more like an equal and to defer to me in other things than reading lessons. This change came about from an adventure we had together. One day when I rode over to the Shimerdas' I found Antonia starting off on foot for Russian Peter's house, to borrow a spade Ambrosch needed. I offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me. There had been another black frost the night before, and the air was clear and heady as wine. Within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiled, hundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown, rattling, burry stalks. We found Russian Peter digging his potatoes. We were glad to go in and get warm by his kitchen stove and to see his squashes and Christmas melons, heaped in the storeroom for winter. As we rode away with the spade, Antonia suggested that we stop at the prairie-dog-town and dig into one of the holes. We could find out whether they ran straight down, or were horizontal, like mole-holes; whether they had underground connections; whether the owls had nests down there, lined with feathers. We might get some puppies, or owl eggs, or snakeskins. The dog-town was spread out over perhaps ten acres. The grass had been nibbled short and even, so this stretch was not shaggy and red like the surrounding country, but grey and velvety. The holes were several yards apart, and were disposed with a good deal of regularity, almost as if the town had been laid out in streets and avenues. One always felt that an orderly and very sociable kind of life was going on there. I picketed Dude down in a draw, and we went wandering about, looking for a hole that would be easy to dig. The dogs were out, as usual, dozens of them, sitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses. As we approached, they barked, shook their tails at us, and scurried underground. Before the mouths of the holes were little patches of sand and gravel, scratched up, we supposed, from a long way below the surface. Here and there, in the town, we came on larger gravel patches, several yards away from any hole. If the dogs had scratched the sand up in excavating, how had they carried it so far? It was on one of these gravel beds that I met my adventure. We were examining a big hole with two entrances. The burrow sloped into the ground at a gentle angle, so that we could see where the two corridors united, and the floor was dusty from use, like a little highway over which much travel went. I was walking backward, in a crouching position, when I heard Antonia scream. She was standing opposite me, pointing behind me and shouting something in Bohemian. I whirled round, and there, on one of those dry gravel beds, was the biggest snake I had ever seen. He was sunning himself, after the cold night, and he must have been asleep when Antonia screamed. When I turned, he was lying in long loose waves, like a letter `W.' He twitched and began to coil slowly. He was not merely a big snake, I thought--he was a circus monstrosity. His abominable muscularity, his loathsome, fluid motion, somehow made me sick. He was as thick as my leg, and looked as if millstones couldn't crush the disgusting vitality out of him. He lifted his hideous little head, and rattled. I didn't run because I didn't think of it--if my back had been against a stone wall I couldn't have felt more cornered. I saw his coils tighten--now he would spring, spring his length, I remembered. I ran up and drove at his head with my spade, struck him fairly across the neck, and in a minute he was all about my feet in wavy loops. I struck now from hate. Antonia, barefooted as she was, ran up behind me. Even after I had pounded his ugly head flat, his body kept on coiling and winding, doubling and falling back on itself. I walked away and turned my back. I felt seasick. Antonia came after me, crying, `O Jimmy, he not bite you? You sure? Why you not run when I say?' `What did you jabber Bohunk for? You might have told me there was a snake behind me!' I said petulantly. `I know I am just awful, Jim, I was so scared.' She took my handkerchief from my pocket and tried to wipe my face with it, but I snatched it away from her. I suppose I looked as sick as I felt. `I never know you was so brave, Jim,' she went on comfortingly. `You is just like big mans; you wait for him lift his head and then you go for him. Ain't you feel scared a bit? Now we take that snake home and show everybody. Nobody ain't seen in this kawntree so big snake like you kill.' She went on in this strain until I began to think that I had longed for this opportunity, and had hailed it with joy. Cautiously we went back to the snake; he was still groping with his tail, turning up his ugly belly in the light. A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green liquid oozed from his crushed head. `Look, Tony, that's his poison,' I said. I took a long piece of string from my pocket, and she lifted his head with the spade while I tied a noose around it. We pulled him out straight and measured him by my riding-quirt; he was about five and a half feet long. He had twelve rattles, but they were broken off before they began to taper, so I insisted that he must once have had twenty-four. I explained to Antonia how this meant that he was twenty-four years old, that he must have been there when white men first came, left on from buffalo and Indian times. As I turned him over, I began to feel proud of him, to have a kind of respect for his age and size. He seemed like the ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have left horrible unconscious memories in all warm-blooded life. When we dragged him down into the draw, Dude sprang off to the end of his tether and shivered all over-- wouldn't let us come near him. We decided that Antonia should ride Dude home, and I would walk. As she rode along slowly, her bare legs swinging against the pony's sides, she kept shouting back to me about how astonished everybody would be. I followed with the spade over my shoulder, dragging my snake. Her exultation was contagious. The great land had never looked to me so big and free. If the red grass were full of rattlers, I was equal to them all. Nevertheless, I stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see that no avenging mate, older and bigger than my quarry, was racing up from the rear. The sun had set when we reached our garden and went down the draw toward the house. Otto Fuchs was the first one we met. He was sitting on the edge of the cattle-pond, having a quiet pipe before supper. Antonia called him to come quick and look. He did not say anything for a minute, but scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot. `Where did you run onto that beauty, Jim?' `Up at the dog-town,' I answered laconically. `Kill him yourself? How come you to have a weepon?' `We'd been up to Russian Peter's, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch.' Otto shook the ashes out of his pipe and squatted down to count the rattles. `It was just luck you had a tool,' he said cautiously. `Gosh! I wouldn't want to do any business with that fellow myself, unless I had a fence-post along. Your grandmother's snake-cane wouldn't more than tickle him. He could stand right up and talk to you, he could. Did he fight hard?' Antonia broke in: `He fight something awful! He is all over Jimmy's boots. I scream for him to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like he was crazy.' Otto winked at me. After Antonia rode on he said: `Got him in the head first crack, didn't you? That was just as well.' We hung him up to the windmill, and when I went down to the kitchen, I found Antonia standing in the middle of the floor, telling the story with a great deal of colour. Subsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance. My big rattler was old, and had led too easy a life; there was not much fight in him. He had probably lived there for years, with a fat prairie-dog for breakfast whenever he felt like it, a sheltered home, even an owl-feather bed, perhaps, and he had forgot that the world doesn't owe rattlers a living. A snake of his size, in fighting trim, would be more than any boy could handle. So in reality it was a mock adventure; the game was fixed for me by chance, as it probably was for many a dragon-slayer. I had been adequately armed by Russian Peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me, to appreciate and admire. That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbours came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again. I had killed a big snake--I was now a big fellow.  VIII WHILE THE AUTUMN COLOUR was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians. Peter told his troubles to Mr. Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow. His creditor was Wick Cutter, the merciless Black Hawk money-lender, a man of evil name throughout the county, of whom I shall have more to say later. Peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with Cutter. He only knew that he had first borrowed two hundred dollars, then another hundred, then fifty--that each time a bonus was added to the principal, and the debt grew faster than any crop he planted. Now everything was plastered with mortgages. Soon after Peter renewed his note, Pavel strained himself lifting timbers for a new barn, and fell over among the shavings with such a gush of blood from the lungs that his fellow workmen thought he would die on the spot. They hauled him home and put him into his bed, and there he lay, very ill indeed. Misfortune seemed to settle like an evil bird on the roof of the log house, and to flap its wings there, warning human beings away. The Russians had such bad luck that people were afraid of them and liked to put them out of mind. One afternoon Antonia and her father came over to our house to get buttermilk, and lingered, as they usually did, until the sun was low. just as they were leaving, Russian Peter drove up. Pavel was very bad, he said, and wanted to talk to Mr. Shimerda and his daughter; he had come to fetch them. When Antonia and her father got into the wagon, I entreated grandmother to let me go with them: I would gladly go without my supper, I would sleep in the Shimerdas' barn and run home in the morning. My plan must have seemed very foolish to her, but she was often large-minded about humouring the desires of other people. She asked Peter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us. Mr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie. If this turn in the weather had come sooner, I should not have got away. We burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together, watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky. Peter kept sighing and groaning. Tony whispered to me that he was afraid Pavel would never get well. We lay still and did not talk. Up there the stars grew magnificently bright. Though we had come from such different parts of the world, in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those shining groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to be. Perhaps Russian Peter, come from farther away than any of us, had brought from his land, too, some such belief. The little house on the hillside was so much the colour of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw. The ruddy windows guided us--the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp burning. We entered softly. The man in the wide bed seemed to be asleep. Tony and I sat down on the bench by the wall and leaned our arms on the table in front of us. The firelight flickered on the hewn logs that supported the thatch overhead. Pavel made a rasping sound when he breathed, and he kept moaning. We waited. The wind shook the doors and windows impatiently, then swept on again, singing through the big spaces. Each gust, as it bore down, rattled the panes, and swelled off like the others. They made me think of defeated armies, retreating; or of ghosts who were trying desperately to get in for shelter, and then went moaning on. Presently, in one of those sobbing intervals between the blasts, the coyotes tuned up with their whining howl; one, two, three, then all together--to tell us that winter was coming. This sound brought an answer from the bed-- a long complaining cry--as if Pavel were having bad dreams or were waking to some old misery. Peter listened, but did not stir. He was sitting on the floor by the kitchen stove. The coyotes broke out again; yap, yap, yap--then the high whine. Pavel called for something and struggled up on his elbow. `He is scared of the wolves,' Antonia whispered to me. `In his country there are very many, and they eat men and women.' We slid closer together along the bench. I could not take my eyes off the man in the bed. His shirt was hanging open, and his emaciated chest, covered with yellow bristle, rose and fell horribly. He began to cough. Peter shuffled to his feet, caught up the teakettle and mixed him some hot water and whiskey. The sharp smell of spirits went through the room. Pavel snatched the cup and drank, then made Peter give him the bottle and slipped it under his pillow, grinning disagreeably, as if he had outwitted someone. His eyes followed Peter about the room with a contemptuous, unfriendly expression. It seemed to me that he despised him for being so simple and docile. Presently Pavel began to talk to Mr. Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper. He was telling a long story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand under the table and held it tight. She leaned forward and strained her ears to hear him. He grew more and more excited, and kept pointing all around his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted Mr. Shimerda to see them.  `It's wolves, Jimmy,' Antonia whispered. `It's awful, what he says!' The sick man raged and shook his fist. He seemed to be cursing people who had wronged him. Mr. Shimerda caught him by the shoulders, but could hardly hold him in bed. At last he was shut off by a coughing fit which fairly choked him. He pulled a cloth from under his pillow and held it to his mouth. Quickly it was covered with bright red spots--I thought I had never seen any blood so bright. When he lay down and turned his face to the wall, all the rage had gone out of him. He lay patiently fighting for breath, like a child with croup. Antonia's father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically. From our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was. His spine and shoulder-blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields. That sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it. Gradually, relief came to all of us. Whatever it was, the worst was over. Mr. Shimerda signed to us that Pavel was asleep. Without a word Peter got up and lit his lantern. He was going out to get his team to drive us home. Mr. Shimerda went with him. We sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe. On the way home, when we were lying in the straw, under the jolting and rattling Antonia told me as much of the story as she could. What she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days afterward.  When Pavel and Peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were asked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another village. It was in the dead of winter and the groom's party went over to the wedding in sledges. Peter and Pavel drove in the groom's sledge, and six sledges followed with all his relatives and friends. After the ceremony at the church, the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride. The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it became a supper and continued far into the night. There was much dancing and drinking. At midnight the parents of the bride said good-bye to her and blessed her. The groom took her up in his arms and carried her out to his sledge and tucked her under the blankets. He sprang in beside her, and Pavel and Peter (our Pavel and Peter!) took the front seat. Pavel drove. The party set out with singing and the jingle of sleigh-bells, the groom's sledge going first. All the drivers were more or less the worse for merry-making, and the groom was absorbed in his bride. The wolves were bad that winter, and everyone knew it, yet when they heard the first wolf-cry, the drivers were not much alarmed. They had too much good food and drink inside them. The first howls were taken up and echoed and with quickening repetitions. The wolves were coming together. There was no moon, but the starlight was clear on the snow. A black drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party. The wolves ran like streaks of shadow; they looked no bigger than dogs, but there were hundreds of them.  Something happened to the hindmost sledge: the driver lost control-- he was probably very drunk--the horses left the road, the sledge was caught in a clump of trees, and overturned. The occupants rolled out over the snow, and the fleetest of the wolves sprang upon them. The shrieks that followed made everybody sober. The drivers stood up and lashed their horses. The groom had the best team and his sledge was lightest-- all the others carried from six to a dozen people. Another driver lost control. The screams of the horses were more terrible to hear than the cries of the men and women. Nothing seemed to check the wolves. It was hard to tell what was happening in the rear; the people who were falling behind shrieked as piteously as those who were already lost. The little bride hid her face on the groom's shoulder and sobbed. Pavel sat still and watched his horses. The road was clear and white, and the groom's three blacks went like the wind. It was only necessary to be calm and to guide them carefully. At length, as they breasted a long hill, Peter rose cautiously and looked back. `There are only three sledges left,' he whispered. `And the wolves?' Pavel asked. `Enough! Enough for all of us.' Pavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him down the other side. In that moment on the hilltop, they saw behind them a whirling black group on the snow. Presently the groom screamed. He saw his father's sledge overturned, with his mother and sisters. He sprang up as if he meant to jump, but the girl shrieked and held him back. It was even then too late. The black ground-shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels. But the groom's movement had given Pavel an idea. They were within a few miles of their village now. The only sledge left out of six was not very far behind them, and Pavel's middle horse was failing. Beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge; Peter saw it plainly. Three big wolves got abreast of the horses, and the horses went crazy. They tried to jump over each other, got tangled up in the harness, and overturned the sledge. When the shrieking behind them died away, Pavel realized that he was alone upon the familiar road. `They still come?' he asked Peter. `Yes.' `How many?' `Twenty, thirty--enough.' Now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two. Pavel gave Peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge. He called to the groom that they must lighten-- and pointed to the bride. The young man cursed him and held her tighter. Pavel tried to drag her away. In the struggle, the groom rose. Pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him. He said he never remembered exactly how he did it, or what happened afterward. Peter, crouching in the front seat, saw nothing. The first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clear air, louder than they had ever heard it before--the bell of the monastery of their own village, ringing for early prayers. Pavel and Peter drove into the village alone, and they had been alone ever since. They were run out of their village. Pavel's own mother would not look at him. They went away to strange towns, but when people learned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves. Wherever they went, the story followed them. It took them five years to save money enough to come to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but they were always unfortunate. When Pavel's health grew so bad, they decided to try farming.  Pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to Mr. Shimerda, and was buried in the Norwegian graveyard. Peter sold off everything, and left the country--went to be cook in a railway construction camp where gangs of Russians were employed. At his sale we bought Peter's wheelbarrow and some of his harness. During the auction he went about with his head down, and never lifted his eyes. He seemed not to care about anything. The Black Hawk money-lender who held mortgages on Peter's livestock was there, and he bought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar. Everyone said Peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner. I did not see him do it, but this I know: after all his furniture and his cookstove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers, when his house was stripped and bare, he sat down on the floor with his clasp-knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter. When Mr. Shimerda and Krajiek drove up in their wagon to take Peter to the train, they found him with a dripping beard, surrounded by heaps of melon rinds. The loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old Mr. Shimerda. When he was out hunting, he used to go into the empty log house and sit there, brooding. This cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave. For Antonia and me, the story of the wedding party was never at an end. We did not tell Pavel's secret to anyone, but guarded it jealously--as if the wolves of the Ukraine had gathered that night long ago, and the wedding party been sacrificed, to give us a painful and peculiar pleasure. At night, before I went to sleep, I often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing through a country that looked something like Nebraska and something like Virginia.  IX THE FIRST SNOWFALL came early in December. I remember how the world looked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind the stove that morning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had faded out into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its stiff willow bushes. Big white flakes were whirling over everything and disappearing in the red grass. Beyond the pond, on the slope that climbed to the cornfield, there was, faintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the Indians used to ride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring the Indians tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the centre; but grandfather thought they merely ran races or trained horses there. Whenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle showed like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the first light spray of snow lay over it, it came out with wonderful distinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure stirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter. As soon as the snow had packed hard, I began to drive about the country in a clumsy sleigh that Otto Fuchs made for me by fastening a wooden goods-box on bobs. Fuchs had been apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in the old country and was very handy with tools. He would have done a better job if I hadn't hurried him. My first trip was to the post-office, and the next day I went over to take Yulka and Antonia for a sleigh-ride. It was a bright, cold day. I piled straw and buffalo robes into the box, and took two hot bricks wrapped in old blankets. When I got to the Shimerdas', I did not go up to the house, but sat in m sleigh at the bottom of the draw and called. Antonia and Yulka came running out, wearing little rabbit-skin hats their father had made for them. They had heard about my sledge from Ambrosch and knew why I had come. They tumbled in beside me and we set off toward the north, along a road that happened to be broken.  The sky was brilliantly blue, and the sunlight on the glittering white stretches of prairie was almost blinding. As Antonia said, the whole world was changed by the snow; we kept looking in vain for familiar landmarks. The deep arroyo through which Squaw Creek wound was now only a cleft between snowdrifts--very blue when one looked down into it. The tree-tops that had been gold all the autumn were dwarfed and twisted, as if they would never have any life in them again. The few little cedars, which were so dull and dingy before, now stood out a strong, dusky green. The wind had the burning taste of fresh snow; my throat and nostrils smarted as if someone had opened a hartshorn bottle. The cold stung, and at the same time delighted one. My horse's breath rose like steam, and whenever we stopped he smoked all over. The cornfields got back a little of their colour under the dazzling light, and stood the palest possible gold in the sun and snow. All about us the snow was crusted in shallow terraces, with tracings like ripple-marks at the edges, curly waves that were the actual impression of the stinging lash in the wind. The girls had on cotton dresses under their shawls; they kept shivering beneath the buffalo robes and hugging each other for warmth. But they were so glad to get away from their ugly cave and their mother's scolding that they begged me to go on and on, as far as Russian Peter's house. The great fresh open, after the stupefying warmth indoors, made them behave like wild things. They laughed and shouted, and said they never wanted to go home again. Couldn't we settle down and live in Russian Peter's house, Yulka asked, and couldn't I go to town and buy things for us to keep house with?  All the way to Russian Peter's we were extravagantly happy, but when we turned back--it must have been about four o'clock-- the east wind grew stronger and began to howl; the sun lost its heartening power and the sky became grey and sombre. I took off my long woollen comforter and wound it around Yulka's throat. She got so cold that we made her hide her head under the buffalo robe. Antonia and I sat erect, but I held the reins clumsily, and my eyes were blinded by the wind a good deal of the time. It was growing dark when we got to their house, but I refused to go in with them and get warm. I knew my hands would ache terribly if I went near a fire. Yulka forgot to give me back my comforter, and I had to drive home directly against the wind. The next day I came down with an attack of quinsy, which kept me in the house for nearly two weeks. The basement kitchen seemed heavenly safe and warm in those days-- like a tight little boat in a winter sea. The men were out in the fields all day, husking corn, and when they came in at noon, with long caps pulled down over their ears and their feet in red-lined overshoes, I used to think they were like Arctic explorers. In the afternoons, when grandmother sat upstairs darning, or making husking-gloves, I read `The Swiss Family Robinson' aloud to her, and I felt that the Swiss family had no advantages over us in the way of an adventurous life. I was convinced that man's strongest antagonist is the cold. I admired the cheerful zest with which grandmother went about keeping us warm and comfortable and well-fed. She often reminded me, when she was preparing for the return of the hungry men, that this country was not like Virginia; and that here a cook had, as she said, `very little to do with.' On Sundays she gave us as much chicken as we could eat, and on other days we had ham or bacon or sausage meat. She baked either pies or cake for us every day, unless, for a change, she made my favourite pudding, striped with currants and boiled in a bag. Next to getting warm and keeping warm, dinner and supper were the most interesting things we had to think about. Our lives centred around warmth and food and the return of the men at nightfall. I used to wonder, when they came in tired from the fields, their feet numb and their hands cracked and sore, how they could do all the chores so conscientiously: feed and water and bed the horses, milk the cows, and look after the pigs. When supper was over, it took them a long while to get the cold out of their bones. While grandmother and I washed the dishes and grandfather read his paper upstairs, Jake and Otto sat on the long bench behind the stove, `easing' their inside boots, or rubbing mutton tallow into their cracked hands. Every Saturday night we popped corn or made taffy, and Otto Fuchs used to sing, `For I Am a Cowboy and Know I've Done Wrong,' or, `Bury Me Not on the Lone Prairee.' He had a good baritone voice and always led the singing when we went to church services at the sod schoolhouse. I can still see those two men sitting on the bench; Otto's close-clipped head and Jake's shaggy hair slicked flat in front by a wet comb. I can see the sag of their tired shoulders against the whitewashed wall. What good fellows they were, how much they knew, and how many things they had kept faith with! Fuchs had been a cowboy, a stage-driver, a bartender, a miner; had wandered all over that great Western country and done hard work everywhere, though, as grandmother said, he had nothing to show for it. Jake was duller than Otto. He could scarcely read, wrote even his name with difficulty, and he had a violent temper which sometimes made him behave like a crazy man--tore him all to pieces and actually made him ill. But he was so soft-hearted that anyone could impose upon him. If he, as he said, `forgot himself' and swore before grandmother, he went about depressed and shamefaced all day. They were both of them jovial about the cold in winter and the heat in summer, always ready to work overtime and to meet emergencies. It was a matter of pride with them not to spare themselves. Yet they were the sort of men who never get on, somehow, or do anything but work hard for a dollar or two a day. On those bitter, starlit nights, as we sat around the old stove that fed us and warmed us and kept us cheerful, we could hear the coyotes howling down by the corrals, and their hungry, wintry cry used to remind the boys of wonderful animal stories; about grey wolves and bears in the Rockies, wildcats and panthers in the Virginia mountains. Sometimes Fuchs could be persuaded to talk about the outlaws and desperate characters he had known. I remember one funny story about himself that made grandmother, who was working her bread on the bread-board, laugh until she wiped her eyes with her bare arm, her hands being floury. It was like this: When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs said he `got on fine with the kids,' and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not one baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he said, `to carry some of them.' The trip to Chicago was even worse than the ocean voyage. On the train it was very difficult to get milk for the babies and to keep their bottles clean. The mother did her best, but no woman, out of her natural resources, could feed three babies. The husband, in Chicago, was working in a furniture factory for modest wages, and when he met his family at the station he was rather crushed by the size of it. He, too, seemed to consider Fuchs in some fashion to blame. `I was sure glad,' Otto concluded, `that he didn't take his hard feeling out on that poor woman; but he had a sullen eye for me, all right! Now, did you ever hear of a young feller's having such hard luck, Mrs. Burden?' Grandmother told him she was sure the Lord had remembered these things to his credit, and had helped him out of many a scrape when he didn't realize that he was being protected by Providence.  X FOR SEVERAL WEEKS after my sleigh-ride, we heard nothing from the Shimerdas. My sore throat kept me indoors, and grandmother had a cold which made the housework heavy for her. When Sunday came she was glad to have a day of rest. One night at supper Fuchs told us he had seen Mr. Shimerda out hunting. `He's made himself a rabbit-skin cap, Jim, and a rabbit-skin collar that he buttons on outside his coat. They ain't got but one overcoat among 'em over there, and they take turns wearing it. They seem awful scared of cold, and stick in that hole in the bank like badgers.' `All but the crazy boy,' Jake put in. `He never wears the coat. Krajiek says he's turrible strong and can stand anything. I guess rabbits must be getting scarce in this locality. Ambrosch come along by the cornfield yesterday where I was at work and showed me three prairie dogs he'd shot. He asked me if they was good to eat. I spit and made a face and took on, to scare him, but he just looked like he was smarter'n me and put 'em back in his sack and walked off.' Grandmother looked up in alarm and spoke to grandfather. `Josiah, you don't suppose Krajiek would let them poor creatures eat prairie dogs, do you?' `You had better go over and see our neighbours tomorrow, Emmaline,' he replied gravely. Fuchs put in a cheerful word and said prairie dogs were clean beasts and ought to be good for food, but their family connections were against them. I asked what he meant, and he grinned and said they belonged to the rat family. When I went downstairs in the morning, I found grandmother and Jake packing a hamper basket in the kitchen. `Now, Jake,' grandmother was saying, `if you can find that old rooster that got his comb froze, just give his neck a twist, and we'll take him along. There's no good reason why Mrs. Shimerda couldn't have got hens from her neighbours last fall and had a hen-house going by now. I reckon she was confused and didn't know where to begin. I've come strange to a new country myself, but I never forgot hens are a good thing to have, no matter what you don't have. `Just as you say, ma'm,' said Jake, `but I hate to think of Krajiek getting a leg of that old rooster.' He tramped out through the long cellar and dropped the heavy door behind him. After breakfast grandmother and Jake and I bundled ourselves up and climbed into the cold front wagon-seat. As we approached the Shimerdas', we heard the frosty whine of the pump and saw Antonia, her head tied up and her cotton dress blown about her, throwing all her weight on the pump-handle as it went up and down. She heard our wagon, looked back over her shoulder, and, catching up her pail of water, started at a run for the hole in the bank. Jake helped grandmother to the ground, saying he would bring the provisions after he had blanketed his horses. We went slowly up the icy path toward the door sunk in the drawside. Blue puffs of smoke came from the stovepipe that stuck out through the grass and snow, but the wind whisked them roughly away. Mrs. Shimerda opened the door before we knocked and seized grandmother's hand. She did not say `How do!' as usual, but at once began to cry, talking very fast in her own language, pointing to her feet which were tied up in rags, and looking about accusingly at everyone. The old man was sitting on a stump behind the stove, crouching over as if he were trying to hide from us. Yulka was on the floor at his feet, her kitten in her lap. She peeped out at me and smiled, but, glancing up at her mother, hid again. Antonia was washing pans and dishes in a dark corner. The crazy boy lay under the only window, stretched on a gunny-sack stuffed with straw. As soon as we entered, he threw a grain-sack over the crack at the bottom of the door. The air in the cave was stifling, and it was very dark, too. A lighted lantern, hung over the stove, threw out a feeble yellow glimmer. Mrs. Shimerda snatched off the covers of two barrels behind the door, and made us look into them. In one there were some potatoes that had been frozen and were rotting, in the other was a little pile of flour. Grandmother murmured something in embarrassment, but the Bohemian woman laughed scornfully, a kind of whinny-laugh, and, catching up an empty coffee-pot from the shelf, shook it at us with a look positively vindictive. Grandmother went on talking in her polite Virginia way, not admitting their stark need or her own remissness, until Jake arrived with the hamper, as if in direct answer to Mrs. Shimerda's reproaches. Then the poor woman broke down. She dropped on the floor beside her crazy son, hid her face on her knees, and sat crying bitterly. Grandmother paid no heed to her, but called Antonia to come and help empty the basket. Tony left her corner reluctantly. I had never seen her crushed like this before. `You not mind my poor mamenka, Mrs. Burden. She is so sad,' she whispered, as she wiped her wet hands on her skirt and took the things grandmother handed her. The crazy boy, seeing the food, began to make soft, gurgling noises and stroked his stomach. Jake came in again, this time with a sack of potatoes. Grandmother looked about in perplexity. `Haven't you got any sort of cave or cellar outside, Antonia? This is no place to keep vegetables. How did your potatoes get frozen?' `We get from Mr. Bushy, at the post-office what he throw out. We got no potatoes, Mrs. Burden,' Tony admitted mournfully. When Jake went out, Marek crawled along the floor and stuffed up the door-crack again. Then, quietly as a shadow, Mr. Shimerda came out from behind the stove. He stood brushing his hand over his smooth grey hair, as if he were trying to clear away a fog about his head. He was clean and neat as usual, with his green neckcloth and his coral pin. He took grandmother's arm and led her behind the stove, to the back of the room. In the rear wall was another little cave; a round hole, not much bigger than an oil barrel, scooped out in the black earth. When I got up on one of the stools and peered into it, I saw some quilts and a pile of straw. The old man held the lantern. `Yulka,' he said in a low, despairing voice, `Yulka; my Antonia!' Grandmother drew back. `You mean they sleep in there--your girls?' He bowed his head. Tony slipped under his arm. `It is very cold on the floor, and this is warm like the badger hole. I like for sleep there,' she insisted eagerly. `My mamenka have nice bed, with pillows from our own geese in Bohemie. See, Jim?' She pointed to the narrow bunk which Krajiek had built against the wall for himself before the Shimerdas came. Grandmother sighed. `Sure enough, where WOULD you sleep, dear! I don't doubt you're warm there. You'll have a better house after while, Antonia, and then you will forget these hard times.' Mr. Shimerda made grandmother sit down on the only chair and pointed his wife to a stool beside her. Standing before them with his hand on Antonia's shoulder, he talked in a low tone, and his daughter translated. He wanted us to know that they were not beggars in the old country; he made good wages, and his family were respected there. He left Bohemia with more than a thousand dollars in savings, after their passage money was paid. He had in some way lost on exchange in New York, and the railway fare to Nebraska was more than they had expected. By the time they paid Krajiek for the land, and bought his horses and oxen and some old farm machinery, they had very little money left. He wished grandmother to know, however, that he still had some money. If they could get through until spring came, they would buy a cow and chickens and plant a garden, and would then do very well. Ambrosch and Antonia were both old enough to work in the fields, and they were willing to work. But the snow and the bitter weather had disheartened them all. Antonia explained that her father meant to build a new house for them in the spring; he and Ambrosch had already split the logs for it, but the logs were all buried in the snow, along the creek where they had been felled. While grandmother encouraged and gave them advice, I sat down on the floor with Yulka and let her show me her kitten. Marek slid cautiously toward us and began to exhibit his webbed fingers. I knew he wanted to make his queer noises for me--to bark like a dog or whinny like a horse--but he did not dare in the presence of his elders. Marek was always trying to be agreeable, poor fellow, as if he had it on his mind that he must make up for his deficiencies. Mrs. Shimerda grew more calm and reasonable before our visit was over, and, while Antonia translated, put in a word now and then on her own account. The woman had a quick ear, and caught up phrases whenever she heard English spoken. As we rose to go, she opened her wooden chest and brought out a bag made of bed-ticking, about as long as a flour sack and half as wide, stuffed full of something. At sight of it, the crazy boy began to smack his lips. When Mrs. Shimerda opened the bag and stirred the contents with her hand, it gave out a salty, earthy smell, very pungent, even among the other odours of that cave. She measured a teacup full, tied it up in a bit of sacking, and presented it ceremoniously to grandmother. `For cook,' she announced. `Little now; be very much when cook,' spreading out her hands as if to indicate that the pint would swell to a gallon. `Very good. You no have in this country. All things for eat better in my country.' `Maybe so, Mrs. Shimerda,' grandmother said dryly. `I can't say but I prefer our bread to yours, myself.' Antonia undertook to explain. `This very good, Mrs. Burden'-- she clasped her hands as if she could not express how good--'it make very much when you cook, like what my mama say. Cook with rabbit, cook with chicken, in the gravy--oh, so good!' All the way home grandmother and Jake talked about how easily good Christian people could forget they were their brothers' keepers. `I will say, Jake, some of our brothers and sisters are hard to keep. Where's a body to begin, with these people? They're wanting in everything, and most of all in horse-sense. Nobody can give 'em that, I guess. Jimmy, here, is about as able to take over a homestead as they are. Do you reckon that boy Ambrosch has any real push in him?' `He's a worker, all right, ma'm, and he's got some ketch-on about him; but he's a mean one. Folks can be mean enough to get on in this world; and then, ag'in, they can be too mean.' That night, while grandmother was getting supper, we opened the package Mrs. Shimerda had given her. It was full of little brown chips that looked like the shavings of some root. They were as light as feathers, and the most noticeable thing about them was their penetrating, earthy odour. We could not determine whether they were animal or vegetable. `They might be dried meat from some queer beast, Jim. They ain't dried fish, and they never grew on stalk or vine. I'm afraid of 'em. Anyhow, I shouldn't want to eat anything that had been shut up for months with old clothes and goose pillows.' She threw the package into the stove, but I bit off a corner of one of the chips I held in my hand, and chewed it tentatively. I never forgot the strange taste; though it was many years before I knew that those little brown shavings, which the Shimerdas had brought so far and treasured so jealously, were dried mushrooms. They had been gathered, probably, in some deep Bohemian forest....  XI DURING THE WEEK before Christmas, Jake was the most important person of our household, for he was to go to town and do all our Christmas shopping. But on the twenty-first of December, the snow began to fall. The flakes came down so thickly that from the sitting-room windows I could not see beyond the windmill-- its frame looked dim and grey, unsubstantial like a shadow. The snow did not stop falling all day, or during the night that followed. The cold was not severe, but the storm was quiet and resistless. The men could not go farther than the barns and corral. They sat about the house most of the day as if it were Sunday; greasing their boots, mending their suspenders, plaiting whiplashes. On the morning of the twenty-second, grandfather announced at breakfast that it would be impossible to go to Black Hawk for Christmas purchases. Jake was sure he could get through on horseback, and bring home our things in saddle-bags; but grandfather told him the roads would be obliterated, and a newcomer in the country would be lost ten times over. Anyway, he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a strain. We decided to have a country Christmas, without any help from town. I had wanted to get some picture books for Yulka and Antonia; even Yulka was able to read a little now. Grandmother took me into the ice-cold storeroom, where she had some bolts of gingham and sheeting. She cut squares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book. We bound it between pasteboards, which I covered with brilliant calico, representing scenes from a circus. For two days I sat at the dining-room table, pasting this book full of pictures for Yulka. We had files of those good old family magazines which used to publish coloured lithographs of popular paintings, and I was allowed to use some of these. I took `Napoleon Announcing the Divorce to Josephine' for my frontispiece. On the white pages I grouped Sunday-School cards and advertising cards which I had brought from my `old country.' Fuchs got out the old candle-moulds and made tallow candles. Grandmother hunted up her fancy cake-cutters and baked gingerbread men and roosters, which we decorated with burnt sugar and red cinnamon drops. On the day before Christmas, Jake packed the things we were sending to the Shimerdas in his saddle-bags and set off on grandfather's grey gelding. When he mounted his horse at the door, I saw that he had a hatchet slung to his belt, and he gave grandmother a meaning look which told me he was planning a surprise for me. That afternoon I watched long and eagerly from the sitting-room window. At last I saw a dark spot moving on the west hill, beside the half-buried cornfield, where the sky was taking on a coppery flush from the sun that did not quite break through. I put on my cap and ran out to meet Jake. When I got to the pond, I could see that he was bringing in a little cedar tree across his pommel. He used to help my father cut Christmas trees for me in Virginia, and he had not forgotten how much I liked them. By the time we had placed the cold, fresh-smelling little tree in a corner of the sitting-room, it was already Christmas Eve. After supper we all gathered there, and even grandfather, reading his paper by the table, looked up with friendly interest now and then. The cedar was about five feet high and very shapely. We hung it with the gingerbread animals, strings of popcorn, and bits of candle which Fuchs had fitted into pasteboard sockets. Its real splendours, however, came from the most unlikely place in the world--from Otto's cowboy trunk. I had never seen anything in that trunk but old boots and spurs and pistols, and a fascinating mixture of yellow leather thongs, cartridges, and shoemaker's wax. From under the lining he now produced a collection of brilliantly coloured paper figures, several inches high and stiff enough to stand alone. They had been sent to him year after year, by his old mother in Austria. There was a bleeding heart, in tufts of paper lace; there were the three kings, gorgeously apparelled, and the ox and the ass and the shepherds; there was the Baby in the manger, and a group of angels, singing; there were camels and leopards, held by the black slaves of the three kings. Our tree became the talking tree of the fairy tale; legends and stories nestled like birds in its branches. Grandmother said it reminded her of the Tree of Knowledge. We put sheets of cotton wool under it for a snow-field, and Jake's pocket-mirror for a frozen lake. I can see them now, exactly as they looked, working about the table in the lamplight: Jake with his heavy features, so rudely moulded that his face seemed, somehow, unfinished; Otto with his half-ear and the savage scar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted moustache. As I remember them, what unprotected faces they were; their very roughness and violence made them defenceless. These boys had no practised manner behind which they could retreat and hold people at a distance. They had only their hard fists to batter at the world with. Otto was already one of those drifting, case-hardened labourers who never marry or have children of their own. Yet he was so fond of children!  XII ON CHRISTMAS MORNING, when I got down to the kitchen, the men were just coming in from their morning chores-- the horses and pigs always had their breakfast before we did. Jake and Otto shouted `Merry Christmas!' to me, and winked at each other when they saw the waffle-irons on the stove. Grandfather came down, wearing a white shirt and his Sunday coat. Morning prayers were longer than usual. He read the chapters from Saint Matthew about the birth of Christ, and as we listened, it all seemed like something that had happened lately, and near at hand. In his prayer he thanked the Lord for the first Christmas, and for all that it had meant to the world ever since. He gave thanks for our food and comfort, and prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities, where the struggle for life was harder than it was here with us. Grandfather's prayers were often very interesting. He had the gift of simple and moving expression. Because he talked so little, his words had a peculiar force; they were not worn dull from constant use. His prayers reflected what he was thinking about at the time, and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and his views about things. After we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased the Shimerdas had been with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with him to cut the Christmas tree. It was a soft grey day outside, with heavy clouds working across the sky, and occasional squalls of snow. There were always odd jobs to be done about the barn on holidays, and the men were busy until afternoon. Then Jake and I played dominoes, while Otto wrote a long letter home to his mother. He always wrote to her on Christmas Day, he said, no matter where he was, and no matter how long it had been since his last letter. All afternoon he sat in the dining-room. He would write for a while, then sit idle, his clenched fist lying on the table, his eyes following the pattern of the oilcloth. He spoke and wrote his own language so seldom that it came to him awkwardly. His effort to remember entirely absorbed him. At about four o'clock a visitor appeared: Mr. Shimerda, wearing his rabbit-skin cap and collar, and new mittens his wife had knitted. He had come to thank us for the presents, and for all grandmother's kindness to his family. Jake and Otto joined us from the basement and we sat about the stove, enjoying the deepening grey of the winter afternoon and the atmosphere of comfort and security in my grandfather's house. This feeling seemed completely to take possession of Mr. Shimerda. I suppose, in the crowded clutter of their cave, the old man had come to believe that peace and order had vanished from the earth, or existed only in the old world he had left so far behind. He sat still and passive, his head resting against the back of the wooden rocking-chair, his hands relaxed upon the arms. His face had a look of weariness and pleasure, like that of sick people when they feel relief from pain. Grandmother insisted on his drinking a glass of Virginia apple-brandy after his long walk in the cold, and when a faint flush came up in his cheeks, his features might have been cut out of a shell, they were so transparent. He said almost nothing, and smiled rarely; but as he rested there we all had a sense of his utter content. As it grew dark, I asked whether I might light the Christmas tree before the lamp was brought. When the candle-ends sent up their conical yellow flames, all the coloured figures from Austria stood out clear and full of meaning against the green boughs. Mr. Shimerda rose, crossed himself, and quietly knelt down before the tree, his head sunk forward. His long body formed a letter `S.' I saw grandmother look apprehensively at grandfather. He was rather narrow in religious matters, and sometimes spoke out and hurt people's feelings. There had been nothing strange about the tree before, but now, with some one kneeling before it--images, candles ... Grandfather merely put his finger-tips to his brow and bowed his venerable head, thus Protestantizing the atmosphere. We persuaded our guest to stay for supper with us. He needed little urging. As we sat down to the table, it occurred to me that he liked to look at us, and that our faces were open books to him. When his deep-seeing eyes rested on me, I felt as if he were looking far ahead into the future for me, down the road I would have to travel. At nine o'clock Mr. Shimerda lighted one of our lanterns and put on his overcoat and fur collar. He stood in the little entry hall, the lantern and his fur cap under his arm, shaking hands with us. When he took grandmother's hand, he bent over it as he always did, and said slowly, `Good woman!' He made the sign of the cross over me, put on his cap and went off in the dark. As we turned back to the sitting-room, grandfather looked at me searchingly. `The prayers of all good people are good,' he said quietly.  XIII THE WEEK FOLLOWING Christmas brought in a thaw, and by New Year's Day all the world about us was a broth of grey slush, and the guttered slope between the windmill and the barn was running black water. The soft black earth stood out in patches along the roadsides. I resumed all my chores, carried in the cobs and wood and water, and spent the afternoons at the barn, watching Jake shell corn with a hand-sheller. One morning, during this interval of fine weather, Antonia and her mother rode over on one of their shaggy old horses to pay us a visit. It was the first time Mrs. Shimerda had been to our house, and she ran about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture, all the while commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious, complaining tone. In the kitchen she caught up an iron pot that stood on the back of the stove and said: `You got many, Shimerdas no got.' I thought it weak-minded of grandmother to give the pot to her. After dinner, when she was helping to wash the dishes, she said, tossing her head: `You got many things for cook. If I got all things like you, I make much better.' She was a conceited, boastful old thing, and even misfortune could not humble her. I was so annoyed that I felt coldly even toward Antonia and listened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well. `My papa sad for the old country. He not look good. He never make music any more. At home he play violin all the time; for weddings and for dance. Here never. When I beg him for play, he shake his head no. Some days he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on the strings, like this, but never he make the music. He don't like this kawntree.' `People who don't like this country ought to stay at home,' I said severely. `We don't make them come here.' Back to Full Books byWilla Cather `He not want to come, never!' she burst out. `My mamenka make him come. All the time she say: ""America big country; much money, much land for my boys, much husband for my girls."" My papa, he cry for leave his old friends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play the long horn like this'-- she indicated a slide trombone. ""They go to school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle.' `Your mama,' I said angrily, `wants other people's things.' ""Your grandfather is rich,"" she retorted fiercely. `Why he not help my papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.' Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother. After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that snooping old woman wouldn't come to see us any more. Grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto's sock. `She's not old, Jim, though I expect she seems old to you. No, I wouldn't mourn if she never came again. But, you see, a body never knows what traits poverty might bring out in 'em. It makes a woman grasping to see her children want for things. Now read me a chapter in ""The Prince of the House of David."" Let's forget the Bohemians.' We had three weeks of this mild, open weather. The cattle in the corral ate corn almost as fast as the men could shell it for them, and we hoped they would be ready for an early market. One morning the two big bulls, Gladstone and Brigham Young, thought spring had come, and they began to tease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them. Soon they got angry. They bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with their hoofs, rolling their eyes and tossing their heads. Each withdrew to a far corner of his own corral, and then they made for each other at a gallop. Thud, thud, we could hear the impact of their great heads, and their bellowing shook the pans on the kitchen shelves. Had they not been dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat steers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while Fuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again and again, finally driving them apart. The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: `You've got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.' All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles. Neither grandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens and brought in a pitiful contribution of eggs. Next day our men had to shovel until noon to reach the barn-- and the snow was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years my grandfather had lived in Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would not try to reach the cattle-- they were fat enough to go without their corn for a day or two; but tomorrow we must feed them and thaw out their water-tap so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the corrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were probably warming each other's backs. `This'll take the bile out of 'em!' Fuchs remarked gleefully. At noon that day the hens had not been heard from. After dinner Jake and Otto, their damp clothes now dried on them, stretched their stiff arms and plunged again into the drifts. They made a tunnel through the snow to the hen-house, with walls so solid that grandmother and I could walk back and forth in it. We found the chickens asleep; perhaps they thought night had come to stay. One old rooster was stirring about, pecking at the solid lump of ice in their water-tin. When we flashed the lantern in their eyes, the hens set up a great cackling and flew about clumsily, scattering down-feathers. The mottled, pin-headed guinea-hens, always resentful of captivity, ran screeching out into the tunnel and tried to poke their ugly, painted faces through the snow walls. By five o'clock the chores were done just when it was time to begin them all over again! That was a strange, unnatural sort of day.  XIV ON THE MORNING of the twenty-second I wakened with a start. Before I opened my eyes, I seemed to know that something had happened. I heard excited voices in the kitchen-- grandmother's was so shrill that I knew she must be almost beside herself. I looked forward to any new crisis with delight. What could it be, I wondered, as I hurried into my clothes. Perhaps the barn had burned; perhaps the cattle had frozen to death; perhaps a neighbour was lost in the storm. Down in the kitchen grandfather was standing before the stove with his hands behind him. Jake and Otto had taken off their boots and were rubbing their woollen socks. Their clothes and boots were steaming, and they both looked exhausted. On the bench behind the stove lay a man, covered up with a blanket. Grandmother motioned me to the dining-room. I obeyed reluctantly. I watched her as she came and went, carrying dishes. Her lips were tightly compressed and she kept whispering to herself: `Oh, dear Saviour!' `Lord, Thou knowest!' Presently grandfather came in and spoke to me: `Jimmy, we will not have prayers this morning, because we have a great deal to do. Old Mr. Shimerda is dead, and his family are in great distress. Ambrosch came over here in the middle of the night, and Jake and Otto went back with him. The boys have had a hard night, and you must not bother them with questions. That is Ambrosch, asleep on the bench. Come in to breakfast, boys.' After Jake and Otto had swallowed their first cup of coffee, they began to talk excitedly, disregarding grandmother's warning glances. I held my tongue, but I listened with all my ears. `No, sir,' Fuchs said in answer to a question from grandfather, `nobody heard the gun go off. Ambrosch was out with the ox-team, trying to break a road, and the women-folks was shut up tight in their cave. When Ambrosch come in, it was dark and he didn't see nothing, but the oxen acted kind of queer. One of 'em ripped around and got away from him-- bolted clean out of the stable. His hands is blistered where the rope run through. He got a lantern and went back and found the old man, just as we seen him.' `Poor soul, poor soul!' grandmother groaned. `I'd like to think he never done it. He was always considerate and un-wishful to give trouble. How could he forget himself and bring this on us!' `I don't think he was out of his head for a minute, Mrs. Burden,' Fuchs declared. `He done everything natural. You know he was always sort of fixy, and fixy he was to the last. He shaved after dinner, and washed hisself all over after the girls had done the dishes. Antonia heated the water for him. Then he put on a clean shirt and clean socks, and after he was dressed he kissed her and the little one and took his gun and said he was going out to hunt rabbits. He must have gone right down to the barn and done it then. He layed down on that bunk-bed, close to the ox stalls, where he always slept. When we found him, everything was decent except'--Fuchs wrinkled his brow and hesitated--'except what he couldn't nowise foresee. His coat was hung on a peg, and his boots was under the bed. He'd took off that silk neckcloth he always wore, and folded it smooth and stuck his pin through it. He turned back his shirt at the neck and rolled up his sleeves.' `I don't see how he could do it!' grandmother kept saying. Otto misunderstood her. `Why, ma'am, it was simple enough; he pulled the trigger with his big toe. He layed over on his side and put the end of the barrel in his mouth, then he drew up one foot and felt for the trigger. He found it all right!' `Maybe he did,' said Jake grimly. `There's something mighty queer about it.' `Now what do you mean, Jake?' grandmother asked sharply. `Well, ma'm, I found Krajiek's axe under the manger, and I picks it up and carries it over to the corpse, and I take my oath it just fit the gash in the front of the old man's face. That there Krajiek had been sneakin' round, pale and quiet, and when he seen me examinin' the axe, he begun whimperin', ""My God, man, don't do that!"" ""I reckon I'm a-goin' to look into this,"" says I. Then he begun to squeal like a rat and run about wringin' his hands. ""They'll hang me!"" says he. ""My God, they'll hang me sure!""' Fuchs spoke up impatiently. `Krajiek's gone silly, Jake, and so have you. The old man wouldn't have made all them preparations for Krajiek to murder him, would he? It don't hang together. The gun was right beside him when Ambrosch found him.' `Krajiek could 'a' put it there, couldn't he?' Jake demanded. Grandmother broke in excitedly: `See here, Jake Marpole, don't you go trying to add murder to suicide. We're deep enough in trouble. Otto reads you too many of them detective stories.' `It will be easy to decide all that, Emmaline,' said grandfather quietly. `If he shot himself in the way they think, the gash will be torn from the inside outward.' `Just so it is, Mr. Burden,' Otto affirmed. `I seen bunches of hair and stuff sticking to the poles and straw along the roof. They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.' Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas' with him. `There is nothing you can do,' he said doubtfully. `The body can't be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.' `Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He's left her alone in a hard world.' She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. `Don't you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,' he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks. `I've got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It's the grey I'm worried about. I'll save him what I can, but it'll strain him, as sure as I'm telling you!' `This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best you can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens's for dinner. She's a good woman, and she'll do well by you.' After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch. I saw a side of him I had not seen before. He was deeply, even slavishly, devout. He did not say a word all morning, but sat with his rosary in his hands, praying, now silently, now aloud. He never looked away from his beads, nor lifted his hands except to cross himself. Several times the poor boy fell asleep where he sat, wakened with a start, and began to pray again. No wagon could be got to the Shimerdas' until a road was broken, and that would be a day's job. Grandfather came from the barn on one of our big black horses, and Jake lifted grandmother up behind him. She wore her black hood and was bundled up in shawls. Grandfather tucked his bushy white beard inside his overcoat. They looked very Biblical as they set off, I thought. Jake and Ambrosch followed them, riding the other black and my pony, carrying bundles of clothes that we had got together for Mrs. Shimerda. I watched them go past the pond and over the hill by the drifted cornfield. Then, for the first time, I realized that I was alone in the house. I felt a considerable extension of power and authority, and was anxious to acquit myself creditably. I carried in cobs and wood from the long cellar, and filled both the stoves. I remembered that in the hurry and excitement of the morning nobody had thought of the chickens, and the eggs had not been gathered. Going out through the tunnel, I gave the hens their corn, emptied the ice from their drinking-pan, and filled it with water. After the cat had had his milk, I could think of nothing else to do, and I sat down to get warm. The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got `Robinson Crusoe' and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda's soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted spirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the ever-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house. I was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb him. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly underground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house. There, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr. Shimerda. Outside I could hear the wind singing over hundreds of miles of snow. It was as if I had let the old man in out of the tormenting winter, and were sitting there with him. I went over all that Antonia had ever told me about his life before he came to this country; how he used to play the fiddle at weddings and dances. I thought about the friends he had mourned to leave, the trombone-player, the great forest full of game--belonging, as Antonia said, to the `nobles'-- from which she and her mother used to steal wood on moonlight nights. There was a white hart that lived in that forest, and if anyone killed it, he would be hanged, she said. Such vivid pictures came to me that they might have been Mr. Shimerda's memories, not yet faded out from the air in which they had haunted him. It had begun to grow dark when my household returned, and grandmother was so tired that she went at once to bed. Jake and I got supper, and while we were washing the dishes he told me in loud whispers about the state of things over at the Shimerdas'. Nobody could touch the body until the coroner came. If anyone did, something terrible would happen, apparently. The dead man was frozen through, `just as stiff as a dressed turkey you hang out to freeze,' Jake said. The horses and oxen would not go into the barn until he was frozen so hard that there was no longer any smell of blood. They were stabled there now, with the dead man, because there was no other place to keep them. A lighted lantern was kept hanging over Mr. Shimerda's head. Antonia and Ambrosch and the mother took turns going down to pray beside him. The crazy boy went with them, because he did not feel the cold. I believed he felt cold as much as anyone else, but he liked to be thought insensible to it. He was always coveting distinction, poor Marek! Ambrosch, Jake said, showed more human feeling than he would have supposed him capable of, but he was chiefly concerned about getting a priest, and about his father's soul, which he believed was in a place of torment and would remain there until his family and the priest had prayed a great deal for him. `As I understand it,' Jake concluded, `it will be a matter of years to pray his soul out of Purgatory, and right now he's in torment.' `I don't believe it,' I said stoutly. `I almost know it isn't true.' I did not, of course, say that I believed he had been in that very kitchen all afternoon, on his way back to his own country. Nevertheless, after I went to bed, this idea of punishment and Purgatory came back on me crushingly. I remembered the account of Dives in torment, and shuddered. But Mr. Shimerda had not been rich and selfish: he had only been so unhappy that he could not live any longer.  XV OTTO FUCHS GOT back from Black Hawk at noon the next day. He reported that the coroner would reach the Shimerdas' sometime that afternoon, but the missionary priest was at the other end of his parish, a hundred miles away, and the trains were not running. Fuchs had got a few hours' sleep at the livery barn in town, but he was afraid the grey gelding had strained himself. Indeed, he was never the same horse afterward. That long trip through the deep snow had taken all the endurance out of him. Fuchs brought home with him a stranger, a young Bohemian who had taken a homestead near Black Hawk, and who came on his only horse to help his fellow countrymen in their trouble. That was the first time I ever saw Anton Jelinek. He was a strapping young fellow in the early twenties then, handsome, warm-hearted, and full of life, and he came to us like a miracle in the midst of that grim business. I remember exactly how he strode into our kitchen in his felt boots and long wolfskin coat, his eyes and cheeks bright with the cold. At sight of grandmother, he snatched off his fur cap, greeting her in a deep, rolling voice which seemed older than he. `I want to thank you very much, Mrs. Burden, for that you are so kind to poor strangers from my kawntree.' He did not hesitate like a farmer boy, but looked one eagerly in the eye when he spoke. Everything about him was warm and spontaneous. He said he would have come to see the Shimerdas before, but he had hired out to husk corn all the fall, and since winter began he had been going to the school by the mill, to learn English, along with the little children. He told me he had a nice `lady-teacher' and that he liked to go to school. At dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to strangers. `Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?' he asked.  Jelinek looked serious. `Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great sin'--he looked straight at grandfather. `Our Lord has said that.' Grandfather seemed to like his frankness. `We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda's soul will come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is our only intercessor.' The young man shook his head. `I know how you think. My teacher at the school has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.' We asked him what he meant. He glanced around the table. `You want I shall tell you? When I was a little boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I make my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to me. By 'n' by war-times come, when the Prussians fight us. We have very many soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that camp, and the men die like flies. All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the vessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.' He paused, looking at grandfather. `That I know, Mr. Burden, for it happened to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, the old priest and me, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers on horse. All those officers, when they see what I carry under the cloth, pull up their horses and kneel down on the ground in the road until we pass. So I feel very bad for my kawntree-man to die without the Sacrament, and to die in a bad way for his soul, and I feel sad for his family.' We had listened attentively. It was impossible not to admire his frank, manly faith. `I am always glad to meet a young man who thinks seriously about these things,' said grandfather, land I would never be the one to say you were not in God's care when you were among the soldiers.' After dinner it was decided that young Jelinek should hook our two strong black farm-horses to the scraper and break a road through to the Shimerdas', so that a wagon could go when it was necessary. Fuchs, who was the only cabinetmaker in the neighbourhood was set to work on a coffin. Jelinek put on his long wolfskin coat, and when we admired it, he told us that he had shot and skinned the coyotes, and the young man who `batched' with him, Jan Bouska, who had been a fur-worker in Vienna, made the coat. From the windmill I watched Jelinek come out of the barn with the blacks, and work his way up the hillside toward the cornfield. Sometimes he was completely hidden by the clouds of snow that rose about him; then he and the horses would emerge black and shining. Our heavy carpenter's bench had to be brought from the barn and carried down into the kitchen. Fuchs selected boards from a pile of planks grandfather had hauled out from town in the fall to make a new floor for the oats-bin. When at last the lumber and tools were assembled, and the doors were closed again and the cold draughts shut out, grandfather rode away to meet the coroner at the Shimerdas', and Fuchs took off his coat and settled down to work. I sat on his worktable and watched him. He did not touch his tools at first, but figured for a long while on a piece of paper, and measured the planks and made marks on them. While he was thus engaged, he whistled softly to himself, or teasingly pulled at his half-ear. Grandmother moved about quietly, so as not to disturb him. At last he folded his ruler and turned a cheerful face to us. `The hardest part of my job's done,' he announced. `It's the head end of it that comes hard with me, especially when I'm out of practice. The last time I made one of these, Mrs. Burden,' he continued, as he sorted and tried his chisels, `was for a fellow in the Black Tiger Mine, up above Silverton, Colorado. The mouth of that mine goes right into the face of the cliff, and they used to put us in a bucket and run us over on a trolley and shoot us into the shaft. The bucket travelled across a box canon three hundred feet deep, and about a third full of water. Two Swedes had fell out of that bucket once, and hit the water, feet down. If you'll believe it, they went to work the next day. You can't kill a Swede. But in my time a little Eyetalian tried the high dive, and it turned out different with him. We was snowed in then, like we are now, and I happened to be the only man in camp that could make a coffin for him. It's a handy thing to know, when you knock about like I've done.' `We'd be hard put to it now, if you didn't know, Otto,' grandmother said.  `Yes, 'm,' Fuchs admitted with modest pride. `So few folks does know how to make a good tight box that'll turn water. I sometimes wonder if there'll be anybody about to do it for me. However, I'm not at all particular that way.' All afternoon, wherever one went in the house, one could hear the panting wheeze of the saw or the pleasant purring of the plane. They were such cheerful noises, seeming to promise new things for living people: it was a pity that those freshly planed pine boards were to be put underground so soon. The lumber was hard to work because it was full of frost, and the boards gave off a sweet smell of pine woods, as the heap of yellow shavings grew higher and higher. I wondered why Fuchs had not stuck to cabinet-work, he settled down to it with such ease and content. He handled the tools as if he liked the feel of them; and when he planed, his hands went back and forth over the boards in an eager, beneficent way as if he were blessing them. He broke out now and then into German hymns, as if this occupation brought back old times to him. At four o'clock Mr. Bushy, the postmaster, with another neighbour who lived east of us, stopped in to get warm. They were on their way to the Shimerdas'. The news of what had happened over there had somehow got abroad through the snow-blocked country. Grandmother gave the visitors sugar-cakes and hot coffee. Before these callers were gone, the brother of the Widow Steavens, who lived on the Black Hawk road, drew up at our door, and after him came the father of the German family, our nearest neighbours on the south. They dismounted and joined us in the dining-room. They were all eager for any details about the suicide, and they were greatly concerned as to where Mr. Shimerda would be buried. The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks before a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in. After our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate cake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody talked more than usual. I had never heard the postmaster say anything but `Only papers, to-day,' or, `I've got a sackful of mail for ye,' until this afternoon. Grandmother always talked, dear woman: to herself or to the Lord, if there was no one else to listen; but grandfather was naturally taciturn, and Jake and Otto were often so tired after supper that I used to feel as if I were surrounded by a wall of silence. Now everyone seemed eager to talk. That afternoon Fuchs told me story after story: about the Black Tiger Mine, and about violent deaths and casual buryings, and the queer fancies of dying men. You never really knew a man, he said, until you saw him die. Most men were game, and went without a grudge. The postmaster, going home, stopped to say that grandfather would bring the coroner back with him to spend the night. The officers of the Norwegian church, he told us, had held a meeting and decided that the Norwegian graveyard could not extend its hospitality to Mr. Shimerda. Grandmother was indignant. `If these foreigners are so clannish, Mr. Bushy, we'll have to have an American graveyard that will be more liberal-minded. I'll get right after Josiah to start one in the spring. If anything was to happen to me, I don't want the Norwegians holding inquisitions over me to see whether I'm good enough to be laid amongst 'em.' Soon grandfather returned, bringing with him Anton Jelinek, and that important person, the coroner. He was a mild, flurried old man, a Civil War veteran, with one sleeve hanging empty. He seemed to find this case very perplexing, and said if it had not been for grandfather he would have sworn out a warrant against Krajiek. `The way he acted, and the way his axe fit the wound, was enough to convict any man.' Although it was perfectly clear that Mr. Shimerda had killed himself, Jake and the coroner thought something ought to be done to Krajiek because he behaved like a guilty man. He was badly frightened, certainly, and perhaps he even felt some stirrings of remorse for his indifference to the old man's misery and loneliness. At supper the men ate like vikings, and the chocolate cake, which I had hoped would linger on until tomorrow in a mutilated condition, disappeared on the second round. They talked excitedly about where they should bury Mr. Shimerda; I gathered that the neighbours were all disturbed and shocked about something. It developed that Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch wanted the old man buried on the southwest corner of their own land; indeed, under the very stake that marked the corner. Grandfather had explained to Ambrosch that some day, when the country was put under fence and the roads were confined to section lines, two roads would cross exactly on that corner. But Ambrosch only said, `It makes no matter.' Grandfather asked Jelinek whether in the old country there was some superstition to the effect that a suicide must be buried at the cross-roads. Jelinek said he didn't know; he seemed to remember hearing there had once been such a custom in Bohemia. `Mrs. Shimerda is made up her mind,' he added. `I try to persuade her, and say it looks bad for her to all the neighbours; but she say so it must be. ""There I will bury him, if I dig the grave myself,"" she say. I have to promise her I help Ambrosch make the grave tomorrow.' Grandfather smoothed his beard and looked judicial. `I don't know whose wish should decide the matter, if not hers. But if she thinks she will live to see the people of this country ride over that old man's head, she is mistaken.'  XVI MR. SHIMERDA LAY DEAD in the barn four days, and on the fifth they buried him. All day Friday Jelinek was off with Ambrosch digging the grave, chopping out the frozen earth with old axes. On Saturday we breakfasted before daylight and got into the wagon with the coffin. Jake and Jelinek went ahead on horseback to cut the body loose from the pool of blood in which it was frozen fast to the ground. When grandmother and I went into the Shimerdas' house, we found the womenfolk alone; Ambrosch and Marek were at the barn. Mrs. Shimerda sat crouching by the stove, Antonia was washing dishes. When she saw me, she ran out of her dark corner and threw her arms around me. `Oh, Jimmy,' she sobbed, `what you tink for my lovely papa!' It seemed to me that I could feel her heart breaking as she clung to me. Mrs. Shimerda, sitting on the stump by the stove, kept looking over her shoulder toward the door while the neighbours were arriving. They came on horseback, all except the postmaster, who brought his family in a wagon over the only broken wagon-trail. The Widow Steavens rode up from her farm eight miles down the Black Hawk road. The cold drove the women into the cave-house, and it was soon crowded. A fine, sleety snow was beginning to fall, and everyone was afraid of another storm and anxious to have the burial over with. Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda's box up the hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for the door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from the cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was bandaged in white muslin, like a mummy's; one of his long, shapely hands lay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him. Mrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body, making the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers. Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek. Yulka hung back. Her mother pushed her forward, and kept saying something to her over and over. Yulka knelt down, shut her eyes, and put out her hand a little way, but she drew it back and began to cry wildly. She was afraid to touch the bandage. Mrs. Shimerda caught her by the shoulders and pushed her toward the coffin, but grandmother interfered. `No, Mrs. Shimerda,' she said firmly, `I won't stand by and see that child frightened into spasms. She is too little to understand what you want of her. Let her alone.' At a look from grandfather, Fuchs and Jelinek placed the lid on the box, and began to nail it down over Mr. Shimerda. I was afraid to look at Antonia. She put her arms round Yulka and held the little girl close to her. The coffin was put into the wagon. We drove slowly away, against the fine, icy snow which cut our faces like a sand-blast. When we reached the grave, it looked a very little spot in that snow-covered waste. The men took the coffin to the edge of the hole and lowered it with ropes. We stood about watching them, and the powdery snow lay without melting on the caps and shoulders of the men and the shawls of the women. Jelinek spoke in a persuasive tone to Mrs. Shimerda, and then turned to grandfather. `She says, Mr. Burden, she is very glad if you can make some prayer for him here in English, for the neighbours to understand.' Grandmother looked anxiously at grandfather. He took off his hat, and the other men did likewise. I thought his prayer remarkable. I still remember it. He began, `Oh, great and just God, no man among us knows what the sleeper knows, nor is it for us to judge what lies between him and Thee.' He prayed that if any man there had been remiss toward the stranger come to a far country, God would forgive him and soften his heart. He recalled the promises to the widow and the fatherless, and asked God to smooth the way before this widow and her children, and to `incline the hearts of men to deal justly with her.' In closing, he said we were leaving Mr. Shimerda at `Thy judgment seat, which is also Thy mercy seat.' All the time he was praying, grandmother watched him through the black fingers of her glove, and when he said `Amen,' I thought she looked satisfied with him. She turned to Otto and whispered, `Can't you start a hymn, Fuchs? It would seem less heathenish.' Fuchs glanced about to see if there was general approval of her suggestion, then began, `Jesus, Lover of my Soul,' and all the men and women took it up after him. Whenever I have heard the hymn since, it has made me remember that white waste and the little group of people; and the bluish air, full of fine, eddying snow, like long veils flying: `While the nearer waters roll,  While the tempest still is high.' Years afterward, when the open-grazing days were over, and the red grass had been ploughed under and under until it had almost disappeared from the prairie; when all the fields were under fence, and the roads no longer ran about like wild things, but followed the surveyed section-lines, Mr. Shimerda's grave was still there, with a sagging wire fence around it, and an unpainted wooden cross. As grandfather had predicted, Mrs. Shimerda never saw the roads going over his head. The road from the north curved a little to the east just there, and the road from the west swung out a little to the south; so that the grave, with its tall red grass that was never mowed, was like a little island; and at twilight, under a new moon or the clear evening star, the dusty roads used to look like soft grey rivers flowing past it. I never came upon the place without emotion, and in all that country it was the spot most dear to me. I loved the dim superstition, the propitiatory intent, that had put the grave there; and still more I loved the spirit that could not carry out the sentence-- the error from the surveyed lines, the clemency of the soft earth roads along which the home-coming wagons rattled after sunset. Never a tired driver passed the wooden cross, I am sure, without wishing well to the sleeper.  XVII WHEN SPRING CAME, AFTER that hard winter, one could not get enough of the nimble air. Every morning I wakened with a fresh consciousness that winter was over. There were none of the signs of spring for which I used to watch in Virginia, no budding woods or blooming gardens. There was only--spring itself; the throb of it, the light restlessness, the vital essence of it everywhere: in the sky, in the swift clouds, in the pale sunshine, and in the warm, high wind--rising suddenly, sinking suddenly, impulsive and playful like a big puppy that pawed you and then lay down to be petted. If I had been tossed down blindfold on that red prairie, I should have known that it was spring. Everywhere now there was the smell of burning grass. Our neighbours burned off their pasture before the new grass made a start, so that the fresh growth would not be mixed with the dead stand of last year. Those light, swift fires, running about the country, seemed a part of the same kindling that was in the air. The Shimerdas were in their new log house by then. The neighbours had helped them to build it in March. It stood directly in front of their old cave, which they used as a cellar. The family were now fairly equipped to begin their struggle with the soil. They had four comfortable rooms to live in, a new windmill--bought on credit--a chicken-house and poultry. Mrs. Shimerda had paid grandfather ten dollars for a milk cow, and was to give him fifteen more as soon as they harvested their first crop. When I rode up to the Shimerdas' one bright windy afternoon in April, Yulka ran out to meet me. It was to her, now, that I gave reading lessons; Antonia was busy with other things. I tied my pony and went into the kitchen where Mrs. Shimerda was baking bread, chewing poppy seeds as she worked. By this time she could speak enough English to ask me a great many questions about what our men were doing in the fields. She seemed to think that my elders withheld helpful information, and that from me she might get valuable secrets. On this occasion she asked me very craftily when grandfather expected to begin planting corn. I told her, adding that he thought we should have a dry spring and that the corn would not be held back by too much rain, as it had been last year. She gave me a shrewd glance. `He not Jesus,' she blustered; `he not know about the wet and the dry. I did not answer her; what was the use? As I sat waiting for the hour when Ambrosch and Antonia would return from the fields, I watched Mrs. Shimerda at her work. She took from the oven a coffee-cake which she wanted to keep warm for supper, and wrapped it in a quilt stuffed with feathers. I have seen her put even a roast goose in this quilt to keep it hot. When the neighbours were there building the new house, they saw her do this, and the story got abroad that the Shimerdas kept their food in their featherbeds.  When the sun was dropping low, Antonia came up the big south draw with her team. How much older she had grown in eight months! She had come to us a child, and now she was a tall, strong young girl, although her fifteenth birthday had just slipped by. I ran out and met her as she brought her horses up to the windmill to water them. She wore the boots her father had so thoughtfully taken off before he shot himself, and his old fur cap. Her outgrown cotton dress switched about her calves, over the boot-tops. She kept her sleeves rolled up all day, and her arms and throat were burned as brown as a sailor's. Her neck came up strongly out of her shoulders, like the bole of a tree out of the turf. One sees that draught-horse neck among the peasant women in all old countries. She greeted me gaily, and began at once to tell me how much ploughing she had done that day. Ambrosch, she said, was on the north quarter, breaking sod with the oxen. `Jim, you ask Jake how much he ploughed to-day. I don't want that Jake get more done in one day than me. I want we have very much corn this fall.' While the horses drew in the water, and nosed each other, and then drank again, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her hand. `You see the big prairie fire from your place last night? I hope your grandpa ain't lose no stacks?' `No, we didn't. I came to ask you something, Tony. Grandmother wants to know if you can't go to the term of school that begins next week over at the sod schoolhouse. She says there's a good teacher, and you'd learn a lot.' Antonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were stiff. `I ain't got time to learn. I can work like mans now. My mother can't say no more how Ambrosch do all and nobody to help him. I can work as much as him. School is all right for little boys. I help make this land one good farm.' She clucked to her team and started for the barn. I walked beside her, feeling vexed. Was she going to grow up boastful like her mother, I wondered? Before we reached the stable, I felt something tense in her silence, and glancing up I saw that she was crying. She turned her face from me and looked off at the red streak of dying light, over the dark prairie. I climbed up into the loft and threw down the hay for her, while she unharnessed her team. We walked slowly back toward the house. Ambrosch had come in from the north quarter, and was watering his oxen at the tank.  Antonia took my hand. `Sometime you will tell me all those nice things you learn at the school, won't you, Jimmy?' she asked with a sudden rush of feeling in her voice. `My father, he went much to school. He know a great deal; how to make the fine cloth like what you not got here. He play horn and violin, and he read so many books that the priests in Bohemie come to talk to him. You won't forget my father, Jim?' `No,' I said, `I will never forget him.' Mrs. Shimerda asked me to stay for supper. After Ambrosch and Antonia had washed the field dust from their hands and faces at the wash-basin by the kitchen door, we sat down at the oilcloth-covered table. Mrs. Shimerda ladled meal mush out of an iron pot and poured milk on it. After the mush we had fresh bread and sorghum molasses, and coffee with the cake that had been kept warm in the feathers. Antonia and Ambrosch were talking in Bohemian; disputing about which of them had done more ploughing that day. Mrs. Shimerda egged them on, chuckling while she gobbled her food. Presently Ambrosch said sullenly in English: `You take them ox tomorrow and try the sod plough. Then you not be so smart.' His sister laughed. `Don't be mad. I know it's awful hard work for break sod. I milk the cow for you tomorrow, if you want.' Mrs. Shimerda turned quickly to me. `That cow not give so much milk like what your grandpa say. If he make talk about fifteen dollars, I send him back the cow.' `He doesn't talk about the fifteen dollars,' I exclaimed indignantly. `He doesn't find fault with people.' `He say I break his saw when we build, and I never,' grumbled Ambrosch. I knew he had broken the saw, and then hid it and lied about it. I began to wish I had not stayed for supper. Everything was disagreeable to me. Antonia ate so noisily now, like a man, and she yawned often at the table and kept stretching her arms over her head, as if they ached. Grandmother had said, `Heavy field work'll spoil that girl. She'll lose all her nice ways and get rough ones.' She had lost them already. After supper I rode home through the sad, soft spring twilight. Since winter I had seen very little of Antonia. She was out in the fields from sunup until sundown. If I rode over to see her where she was ploughing, she stopped at the end of a row to chat for a moment, then gripped her plough-handles, clucked to her team, and waded on down the furrow, making me feel that she was now grown up and had no time for me. On Sundays she helped her mother make garden or sewed all day. Grandfather was pleased with Antonia. When we complained of her, he only smiled and said, `She will help some fellow get ahead in the world.' Nowadays Tony could talk of nothing but the prices of things, or how much she could lift and endure. She was too proud of her strength. I knew, too, that Ambrosch put upon her some chores a girl ought not to do, and that the farm-hands around the country joked in a nasty way about it. Whenever I saw her come up the furrow, shouting to her beasts, sunburned, sweaty, her dress open at the neck, and her throat and chest dust-plastered, I used to think of the tone in which poor Mr. Shimerda, who could say so little, yet managed to say so much when he exclaimed, ` !'  XVIII AFTER I BEGAN TO go to the country school, I saw less of the Bohemians. We were sixteen pupils at the sod schoolhouse, and we all came on horseback and brought our dinner. My schoolmates were none of them very interesting, but I somehow felt that, by Taking comrades of them, I was getting even with Antonia for her indifference. Since the father's death, Ambrosch was more than ever the head of the house, and he seemed to direct the feelings as well as the fortunes of his womenfolk. Antonia often quoted his opinions to me, and she let me see that she admired him, while she thought of me only as a little boy. Before the spring was over, there was a distinct coldness between us and the Shimerdas. It came about in this way.  One Sunday I rode over there with Jake to get a horse-collar which Ambrosch had borrowed from him and had not returned. It was a beautiful blue morning. The buffalo-peas were blooming in pink and purple masses along the roadside, and the larks, perched on last year's dried sunflower stalks, were singing straight at the sun, their heads thrown back and their yellow breasts a-quiver. The wind blew about us in warm, sweet gusts. We rode slowly, with a pleasant sense of Sunday indolence. We found the Shimerdas working just as if it were a week-day. Marek was cleaning out the stable, and Antonia and her mother were making garden, off across the pond in the draw-head. Ambrosch was up on the windmill tower, oiling the wheel. He came down, not very cordially. When Jake asked for the collar, he grunted and scratched his head. The collar belonged to grandfather, of course, and Jake, feeling responsible for it, flared up. `Now, don't you say you haven't got it, Ambrosch, because I know you have, and if you ain't a-going to look for it, I will.' Ambrosch shrugged his shoulders and sauntered down the hill toward the stable. I could see that it was one of his mean days. Presently he returned, carrying a collar that had been badly used-- trampled in the dirt and gnawed by rats until the hair was sticking out of it. `This what you want?' he asked surlily. Jake jumped off his horse. I saw a wave of red come up under the rough stubble on his face. `That ain't the piece of harness I loaned you, Ambrosch; or, if it is, you've used it shameful. I ain't a-going to carry such a looking thing back to Mr. Burden.' Ambrosch dropped the collar on the ground. `All right,' he said coolly, took up his oil-can, and began to climb the mill. Jake caught him by the belt of his trousers and yanked him back. Ambrosch's feet had scarcely touched the ground when he lunged out with a vicious kick at Jake's stomach. Fortunately, Jake was in such a position that he could dodge it. This was not the sort of thing country boys did when they played at fisticuffs, and Jake was furious. He landed Ambrosch a blow on the head--it sounded like the crack of an axe on a cow-pumpkin. Ambrosch dropped over, stunned. We heard squeals, and looking up saw Antonia and her mother coming on the run. They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. `Let's get out of this, Jim,' he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. `Law, law!' she shrieked after us. `Law for knock my Ambrosch down!' `I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,' Antonia panted. `No friends any more!' Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. `Well, you're a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,' he shouted back. `I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You've been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!' We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn't a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry. `They ain't the same, Jimmy,' he kept saying in a hurt tone. `These foreigners ain't the same. You can't trust 'em to be fair. It's dirty to kick a feller. You heard how the women turned on you-- and after all we went through on account of 'em last winter! They ain't to be trusted. I don't want to see you get too thick with any of 'em.' `I'll never be friends with them again, Jake,' I declared hotly. `I believe they are all like Krajiek and Ambrosch underneath.' Grandfather heard our story with a twinkle in his eye. He advised Jake to ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had knocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda was inclined to make trouble-- her son was still under age--she would be forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to market the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after Jake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving by, looking neither to the right nor left. As they rattled out of sight down the Black Hawk road, grandfather chuckled, saying he had rather expected she would follow the matter up. Jake paid his fine with a ten-dollar bill grandfather had given him for that purpose. But when the Shimerdas found that Jake sold his pig in town that day, Ambrosch worked it out in his shrewd head that Jake had to sell his pig to pay his fine. This theory afforded the Shimerdas great satisfaction, apparently. For weeks afterward, whenever Jake and I met Antonia on her way to the post-office, or going along the road with her work-team, she would clap her hands and call to us in a spiteful, crowing voice: `Jake-y, Jake-y, sell the pig and pay the slap!' Otto pretended not to be surprised at Antonia's behaviour. He only lifted his brows and said, `You can't tell me anything new about a Czech; I'm an Austrian.' Grandfather was never a party to what Jake called our feud with the Shimerdas. Ambrosch and Antonia always greeted him respectfully, and he asked them about their affairs and gave them advice as usual. He thought the future looked hopeful for them. Ambrosch was a far-seeing fellow; he soon realized that his oxen were too heavy for any work except breaking sod, and he succeeded in selling them to a newly arrived German. With the money he bought another team of horses, which grandfather selected for him. Marek was strong, and Ambrosch worked him hard; but he could never teach him to cultivate corn, I remember. The one idea that had ever got through poor Marek's thick head was that all exertion was meritorious. He always bore down on the handles of the cultivator and drove the blades so deep into the earth that the horses were soon exhausted. In June, Ambrosch went to work at Mr. Bushy's for a week, and took Marek with him at full wages. Mrs. Shimerda then drove the second cultivator; she and Antonia worked in the fields all day and did the chores at night. While the two women were running the place alone, one of the new horses got colic and gave them a terrible fright. Antonia had gone down to the barn one night to see that all was well before she went to bed, and she noticed that one of the roans was swollen about the middle and stood with its head hanging. She mounted another horse, without waiting to saddle him, and hammered on our door just as we were going to bed. Grandfather answered her knock. He did not send one of his men, but rode back with her himself, taking a syringe and an old piece of carpet he kept for hot applications when our horses were sick. He found Mrs. Shimerda sitting by the horse with her lantern, groaning and wringing her hands. It took but a few moments to release the gases pent up in the poor beast, and the two women heard the rush of wind and saw the roan visibly diminish in girth. `If I lose that horse, Mr. Burden,' Antonia exclaimed, `I never stay here till Ambrosch come home! I go drown myself in the pond before morning.' When Ambrosch came back from Mr. Bushy's, we learned that he had given Marek's wages to the priest at Black Hawk, for Masses for their father's soul. Grandmother thought Antonia needed shoes more than Mr. Shimerda needed prayers, but grandfather said tolerantly, `If he can spare six dollars, pinched as he is, it shows he believes what he professes.' It was grandfather who brought about a reconciliation with the Shimerdas. One morning he told us that the small grain was coming on so well, he thought he would begin to cut his wheat on the first of July. He would need more men, and if it were agreeable to everyone he would engage Ambrosch for the reaping and threshing, as the Shimerdas had no small grain of their own. `I think, Emmaline,' he concluded, `I will ask Antonia to come over and help you in the kitchen. She will be glad to earn something, and it will be a good time to end misunderstandings. I may as well ride over this morning and make arrangements. Do you want to go with me, Jim?' His tone told me that he had already decided for me. After breakfast we set off together. When Mrs. Shimerda saw us coming, she ran from her door down into the draw behind the stable, as if she did not want to meet us. Grandfather smiled to himself while he tied his horse, and we followed her. Behind the barn we came upon a funny sight. The cow had evidently been grazing somewhere in the draw. Mrs. Shimerda had run to the animal, pulled up the lariat pin, and, when we came upon her, she was trying to hide the cow in an old cave in the bank. As the hole was narrow and dark, the cow held back, and the old woman was slapping and pushing at her hind quarters, trying to spank her into the drawside. Grandfather ignored her singular occupation and greeted her politely. `Good morning, Mrs. Shimerda. Can you tell me where I will find Ambrosch? Which field?' `He with the sod corn.' She pointed toward the north, still standing in front of the cow as if she hoped to conceal it. `His sod corn will be good for fodder this winter,' said grandfather encouragingly. `And where is Antonia?' `She go with.' Mrs. Shimerda kept wiggling her bare feet about nervously in the dust. `Very well. I will ride up there. I want them to come over and help me cut my oats and wheat next month. I will pay them wages. Good morning. By the way, Mrs. Shimerda,' he said as he turned up the path, `I think we may as well call it square about the cow.' She started and clutched the rope tighter. Seeing that she did not understand, grandfather turned back. `You need not pay me anything more; no more money. The cow is yours.' `Pay no more, keep cow?' she asked in a bewildered tone, her narrow eyes snapping at us in the sunlight. `Exactly. Pay no more, keep cow.' He nodded. Mrs. Shimerda dropped the rope, ran after us, and, crouching down beside grandfather, she took his hand and kissed it. I doubt if he had ever been so much embarrassed before. I was a little startled, too. Somehow, that seemed to bring the Old World very close. We rode away laughing, and grandfather said: `I expect she thought we had come to take the cow away for certain, Jim. I wonder if she wouldn't have scratched a little if we'd laid hold of that lariat rope!' Our neighbours seemed glad to make peace with us. The next Sunday Mrs. Shimerda came over and brought Jake a pair of socks she had knitted. She presented them with an air of great magnanimity, saying, `Now you not come any more for knock my Ambrosch down?' Jake laughed sheepishly. `I don't want to have no trouble with Ambrosch. If he'll let me alone, I'll let him alone.' `If he slap you, we ain't got no pig for pay the fine,' she said insinuatingly. Jake was not at all disconcerted. `Have the last word ma'm,' he said cheerfully. `It's a lady's privilege.'  XIX JULY CAME ON with that breathless, brilliant heat which makes the plains of Kansas and Nebraska the best corn country in the world. It seemed as if we could hear the corn growing in the night; under the stars one caught a faint crackling in the dewy, heavy-odoured cornfields where the feathered stalks stood so juicy and green. If all the great plain from the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains had been under glass, and the heat regulated by a thermometer, it could not have been better for the yellow tassels that were ripening and fertilizing the silk day by day. The cornfields were far apart in those times, with miles of wild grazing land between. It took a clear, meditative eye like my grandfather's to foresee that they would enlarge and multiply until they would be, not the Shimerdas' cornfields, or Mr. Bushy's, but the world's cornfields; that their yield would be one of the great economic facts, like the wheat crop of Russia, which underlie all the activities of men, in peace or war. The burning sun of those few weeks, with occasional rains at night, secured the corn. After the milky ears were once formed, we had little to fear from dry weather. The men were working so hard in the wheatfields that they did not notice the heat--though I was kept busy carrying water for them--and grandmother and Antonia had so much to do in the kitchen that they could not have told whether one day was hotter than another. Each morning, while the dew was still on the grass, Antonia went with me up to the garden to get early vegetables for dinner. Grandmother made her wear a sunbonnet, but as soon as we reached the garden she threw it on the grass and let her hair fly in the breeze. I remember how, as we bent over the pea-vines, beads of perspiration used to gather on her upper lip like a little moustache. `Oh, better I like to work out-of-doors than in a house!' she used to sing joyfully. `I not care that your grandmother say it makes me like a man. I like to be like a man.' She would toss her head and ask me to feel the muscles swell in her brown arm. We were glad to have her in the house. She was so gay and responsive that one did not mind her heavy, running step, or her clattery way with pans. Grandmother was in high spirits during the weeks that Antonia worked for us. All the nights were close and hot during that harvest season. The harvesters slept in the hayloft because it was cooler there than in the house. I used to lie in my bed by the open window, watching the heat lightning play softly along the horizon, or looking up at the gaunt frame of the windmill against the blue night sky. One night there was a beautiful electric storm, though not enough rain fell to damage the cut grain. The men went down to the barn immediately after supper, and when the dishes were washed, Antonia and I climbed up on the slanting roof of the chicken-house to watch the clouds. The thunder was loud and metallic, like the rattle of sheet iron, and the lightning broke in great zigzags across the heavens, making everything stand out and come close to us for a moment. Half the sky was chequered with black thunderheads, but all the west was luminous and clear: in the lightning flashes it looked like deep blue water, with the sheen of moonlight on it; and the mottled part of the sky was like marble pavement, like the quay of some splendid seacoast city, doomed to destruction. Great warm splashes of rain fell on our upturned faces. One black cloud, no bigger than a little boat, drifted out into the clear space unattended, and kept moving westward. All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. `In a minute we come,' Antonia called back to her. `I like your grandmother, and all things here,' she sighed. `I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.' `It will be summer a long while yet,' I reassured her. `Why aren't you always nice like this, Tony?' `How nice?' `Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?' She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. `If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.' "
The Age of Innocence: Novel Summary: Chapters 4-6,"  Archer and May begin their round of betrothal visits by calling on May's family matriarch, Catherine Manson Mingott, at her home. Mrs Mingott cannot go upstairs because of her obesity, and has arranged her sitting room on the ground floor, with her bedroom in full view of guests. This shockingly recalls ""scenes in French fiction, and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed of. That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies. ."" It amuses Archer to think of ""her blameless life led in the stage-setting of adultery"" (Chapter 4, p. 24). To everyone's relief, Ellen Olenska is not present when the betrothed couple arrive. Mrs Mingott gives the couple her blessing and asks when the wedding will be. Mrs Welland offers a show of reluctance to hurry it. Ellen enters with Julius Beaufort. Archer tells her about the engagement, which she already knows of. As she bids him goodbye, she asks him to come and visit her. After the Wellands leave, they discuss the occasion, taking care not to mention Ellen. But Archer knows that Mrs Welland disapproves of Ellen's being seen out walking with Beaufort, and also feels that Ellen should know that a recently engaged man does not call on married women. He is glad that he is to marry ""one of his own kind."" Archer's mother, Mrs Archer, is shy but likes to know what is going on in society, so she invites the expert, Sillerton Jackson, to dinner. The unspoken implication is that she wants to know about Ellen. Archer is at the dinner, as is his sister Janey. Eventually, after pretending to be interested in other topics of conversation, Mrs Archer asks Sillerton if Ellen was at the Beauforts' ball, and Sillerton replies that she was not. They discuss her in patronizing terms, Mrs Archer remarking that little can be expected of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming-out ball (presumably, a more demure color and fabric would be more fitting). During the discussion about Ellen that follows, Archer defends her actions against the disapproving company. He defends her right to be conspicuous if she wishes, applauds the secretary for helping her escape from her husband, and hopes that she gets a divorce (divorce was an unusual and stigmatizing action at this time). After dinner, Archer and Sillerton retire to the library. Sillerton tells Archer that the secretary did not merely help Ellen, but was living with her a year later in Lausanne, Switzerland. Archer is embarrassed but continues to stand up for Ellen, defending her right to make her life anew with whoever she pleases, especially since her husband preferred to live with harlots. ""Women ought to be free - as free as we are,"" he says, condemning the double standard prevalent at the time that allowed men, but not women, to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. Sillerton comments that Count Olenski evidently agrees with Archer, since he has not tried to get his wife back. Archer reflects on the case of the unconventional Ellen and his approaching marriage to the traditional May, ""that terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything."" Now that his settled convictions have been shaken up by Ellen's story, May seems like a stranger, and marriage no longer a ""safe anchorage"" but ""a voyage on uncharted seas"" (Chapter 6, p. 36). The author undermines Archer's championing of the freedom of women by commenting that, from his point of view, "" 'Nice' women, however wronged, would never claim the kind of freedom he meant, and generous-minded men like himself were therefore - in the heat of argument - the more ready to concede it to them."" (Chapter 6, p. 37) However, it is clear that Archer is questioning the convention whereby out of decency, men were expected to conceal their past from their wives-to-be, and women were not allowed to have any past at all: what could he and May really know of each other? He worries that his marriage might become what most other marriages around him were: ""a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on one side and hypocrisy on the other."" (Chapter 6, p. 37) An example is Lawrence Lefferts, whose well-trained wife averts her gaze indignantly when someone mentions Julius Beaufort's maintaining a mistress and yet turns a blind eye to her husband's love affairs. Archer is also questioning the value of May's innocence, which he now views as oppressive, a creation ""manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to be what he wanted."" (Chapter 6, p. 39). His doubts have been prompted by the case of Ellen. Mrs Lovell Mingott sends out invitations ""To meet the Countess Olenska."" However, everyone refuses, except the Beauforts and Sillerton Jackson. Ellen has been snubbed. Archer is outraged. Mrs Archer intervenes by going to see Louisa van der Luyden, whose family, descended from Dutch aristocracy, stands at the head of New York society. She says that she is doing this for May's sake and for the sake of society (not, it seems, for Ellen's sake, who seems the one most in need of help). Analysis Because of Mrs Mingott's powerful place in New York society and her blameless life, she is able to transgress some of the forms of correctness, such as having her bedroom in full view of guests. She feels a kinship with Julius Beaufort, since both possess an ability to take ""short-cuts through the conventions"" (Chapter 4, p. 26) Ellen shocks Archer with her ignorance or carelessness of convention in inviting him to call on her, a married woman. He prides himself on his cosmopolitan views, but is glad that he is allying himself to ""one of his own kind,"" May Welland. Mrs Archer and her daughter know all about Julius Beaufort's shady history, but they avoid talking about it openly. The Beauforts are, however, accepted and even courted because the scandal is not in public view, illustrating the extreme hypocrisy of fashionable society. Nevertheless, Mrs Archer, born into 'old money' and 'good family', believes Beaufort to be vulgar. The theme of hypocrisy, in the sense of hiding one's true thoughts and feelings under a system of codes, continues in the narrator's comment on Mrs Archer and her son: "". it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts"" (Chapter 5, p. 32). We see a new and refreshing side of Archer when this young man, who has thus far appeared rather conventional, condemns the double standard prevalent in society at the time that allowed men, but not women, the freedom to seek fulfillment outside a failed marriage. However, the narrator points out dryly that he has not thought through the implications of his progressive view, perhaps with regard to his own traditional marriage. The author goes on to undermine Archer's championing of women's freedom as ""humbugging disguise"" (Chapter 6, p. 37), as, from his point of view, 'nice' women would not claim the kind of freedom he meant, and thus generous-minded men like himself were the more ready to concede it to them. But Ellen's case has stirred up his old settled convictions, so that marriage seems less like a ""safe anchorage"" than ""a voyage on uncharted seas,"" and May, the traditional girl who ""knew nothing and expected everything,"" now seems disconcertingly like a stranger. The narrator uses Archer's reflection on the falseness of most marriages to make an observation on the hypocrisy of New York society that could stand as emblematic of : ""In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs."" (Chapter 6, p. 38). An example is Mrs Archer's pretence of reluctance at bringing forward the announcement of the engagement, when, in fact, she is eager to see the marriage happen soon. Archer's new vision of May's innocence as a product carefully manufactured by relatives casts an ironic light on the novel's title. Through Archer, Wharton seems to ask, what is the value of the 'innocence' that girls aspire to and which men are supposed to want in a wife? Wharton's own answer, given through Archer's point of view, seems clear: ""He could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the Babes in the Wood."" (Chapter 6, p. 39). ",The Age of Innocence,Chapters 4-6," In the course of the next day the first of the usual betrothal visits were exchanged. The New York ritual was precise and inflexible in such matters; and in conformity with it Newland Archer first went with his mother and sister to call on Mrs. Welland, after which he and Mrs. Welland and May drove out to old Mrs. Manson Mingott's to receive that venerable ancestress's blessing. A visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott was always an amusing episode to the young man. The house in itself was already an historic document, though not, of course, as venerable as certain other old family houses in University Place and lower Fifth Avenue. Those were of the purest 1830, with a grim harmony of cabbage- rose-garlanded carpets, rosewood consoles, round-arched fire-places with black marble mantels, and immense glazed book-cases of mahogany; whereas old Mrs. Mingott, who had built her house later, had bodily cast out the massive furniture of her prime, and mingled with the Mingott heirlooms the frivolous upholstery of the Second Empire. It was her habit to sit in a window of her sitting-room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitary doors. She seemed in no hurry to have them come, for her patience was equalled by her confidence. She was sure that presently the hoardings, the quarries, the one-story saloons, the wooden green-houses in ragged gardens, and the rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before the advance of residences as stately as her own--perhaps (for she was an impartial woman) even statelier; and that the cobble- stones over which the old clattering omnibuses bumped would be replaced by smooth asphalt, such as people reported having seen in Paris. Meanwhile, as every one she cared to see came to HER (and she could fill her rooms as easily as the Beauforts, and without adding a single item to the menu of her suppers), she did not suffer from her geographic isolation. The immense accretion of flesh which had descended on her in middle life like a flood of lava on a doomed city had changed her from a plump active little woman with a neatly-turned foot and ankle into something as vast and august as a natural phenomenon. She had accepted this submergence as philosophically as all her other trials, and now, in extreme old age, was rewarded by presenting to her mirror an almost unwrinkled expanse of firm pink and white flesh, in the centre of which the traces of a small face survived as if awaiting excavation. A flight of smooth double chins led down to the dizzy depths of a still-snowy bosom veiled in snowy muslins that were held in place by a miniature portrait of the late Mr. Mingott; and around and below, wave after wave of black silk surged away over the edges of a capacious armchair, with two tiny white hands poised like gulls on the surface of the billows. The burden of Mrs. Manson Mingott's flesh had long since made it impossible for her to go up and down stairs, and with characteristic independence she had made her reception rooms upstairs and established herself (in flagrant violation of all the New York proprieties) on the ground floor of her house; so that, as you sat in her sitting-room window with her, you caught (through a door that was always open, and a looped- back yellow damask portiere) the unexpected vista of a bedroom with a huge low bed upholstered like a sofa, and a toilet-table with frivolous lace flounces and a gilt-framed mirror. Her visitors were startled and fascinated by the foreignness of this arrangement, which recalled scenes in French fiction, and architectural incentives to immorality such as the simple American had never dreamed of. That was how women with lovers lived in the wicked old societies, in apartments with all the rooms on one floor, and all the indecent propinquities that their novels described. It amused Newland Archer (who had secretly situated the love-scenes of ""Monsieur de Camors"" in Mrs. Mingott's bedroom) to picture her blameless life led in the stage-setting of adultery; but he said to himself, with considerable admiration, that if a lover had been what she wanted, the intrepid woman would have had him too. To the general relief the Countess Olenska was not present in her grandmother's drawing-room during the visit of the betrothed couple. Mrs. Mingott said she had gone out; which, on a day of such glaring sunlight, and at the ""shopping hour,"" seemed in itself an indelicate thing for a compromised woman to do. But at any rate it spared them the embarrassment of her presence, and the faint shadow that her unhappy past might seem to shed on their radiant future. The visit went off successfully, as was to have been expected. Old Mrs. Mingott was delighted with the engagement, which, being long foreseen by watchful relatives, had been carefully passed upon in family council; and the engagement ring, a large thick sapphire set in invisible claws, met with her unqualified admiration. ""It's the new setting: of course it shows the stone beautifully, but it looks a little bare to old-fashioned eyes,"" Mrs. Welland had explained, with a conciliatory side-glance at her future son-in-law. ""Old-fashioned eyes? I hope you don't mean mine, my dear? I like all the novelties,"" said the ancestress, lifting the stone to her small bright orbs, which no glasses had ever disfigured. ""Very handsome,"" she added, returning the jewel; ""very liberal. In my time a cameo set in pearls was thought sufficient. But it's the hand that sets off the ring, isn't it, my dear Mr. Archer?"" and she waved one of her tiny hands, with small pointed nails and rolls of aged fat encircling the wrist like ivory bracelets. ""Mine was modelled in Rome by the great Ferrigiani. You should have May's done: no doubt he'll have it done, my child. Her hand is large--it's these modern sports that spread the joints--but the skin is white.--And when's the wedding to be?"" she broke off, fixing her eyes on Archer's face. ""Oh--"" Mrs. Welland murmured, while the young man, smiling at his betrothed, replied: ""As soon as ever it can, if only you'll back me up, Mrs. Mingott."" ""We must give them time to get to know each other a little better, mamma,"" Mrs. Welland interposed, with the proper affectation of reluctance; to which the ancestress rejoined: ""Know each other? Fiddlesticks! Everybody in New York has always known everybody. Let the young man have his way, my dear; don't wait till the bubble's off the wine. Marry them before Lent; I may catch pneumonia any winter now, and I want to give the wedding-breakfast."" These successive statements were received with the proper expressions of amusement, incredulity and gratitude; and the visit was breaking up in a vein of mild pleasantry when the door opened to admit the Countess Olenska, who entered in bonnet and mantle followed by the unexpected figure of Julius Beaufort. There was a cousinly murmur of pleasure between the ladies, and Mrs. Mingott held out Ferrigiani's model to the banker. ""Ha! Beaufort, this is a rare favour!"" (She had an odd foreign way of addressing men by their surnames.) ""Thanks. I wish it might happen oftener,"" said the visitor in his easy arrogant way. ""I'm generally so tied down; but I met the Countess Ellen in Madison Square, and she was good enough to let me walk home with her."" ""Ah--I hope the house will be gayer, now that Ellen's here!"" cried Mrs. Mingott with a glorious effrontery. ""Sit down--sit down, Beaufort: push up the yellow armchair; now I've got you I want a good gossip. I hear your ball was magnificent; and I understand you invited Mrs. Lemuel Struthers? Well--I've a curiosity to see the woman myself."" She had forgotten her relatives, who were drifting out into the hall under Ellen Olenska's guidance. Old Mrs. Mingott had always professed a great admiration for Julius Beaufort, and there was a kind of kinship in their cool domineering way and their short-cuts through the conventions. Now she was eagerly curious to know what had decided the Beauforts to invite (for the first time) Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, the widow of Struthers's Shoe-polish, who had returned the previous year from a long initiatory sojourn in Europe to lay siege to the tight little citadel of New York. ""Of course if you and Regina invite her the thing is settled. Well, we need new blood and new money--and I hear she's still very good-looking,"" the carnivorous old lady declared. In the hall, while Mrs. Welland and May drew on their furs, Archer saw that the Countess Olenska was looking at him with a faintly questioning smile. ""Of course you know already--about May and me,"" he said, answering her look with a shy laugh. ""She scolded me for not giving you the news last night at the Opera: I had her orders to tell you that we were engaged--but I couldn't, in that crowd."" The smile passed from Countess Olenska's eyes to her lips: she looked younger, more like the bold brown Ellen Mingott of his boyhood. ""Of course I know; yes. And I'm so glad. But one doesn't tell such things first in a crowd."" The ladies were on the threshold and she held out her hand. ""Good-bye; come and see me some day,"" she said, still looking at Archer. In the carriage, on the way down Fifth Avenue, they talked pointedly of Mrs. Mingott, of her age, her spirit, and all her wonderful attributes. No one alluded to Ellen Olenska; but Archer knew that Mrs. Welland was thinking: ""It's a mistake for Ellen to be seen, the very day after her arrival, parading up Fifth Avenue at the crowded hour with Julius Beaufort--"" and the young man himself mentally added: ""And she ought to know that a man who's just engaged doesn't spend his time calling on married women. But I daresay in the set she's lived in they do--they never do anything else."" And, in spite of the cosmopolitan views on which he prided himself, he thanked heaven that he was a New Yorker, and about to ally himself with one of his own kind.  V. The next evening old Mr. Sillerton Jackson came to dine with the Archers. Mrs. Archer was a shy woman and shrank from society; but she liked to be well-informed as to its doings. Her old friend Mr. Sillerton Jackson applied to the investigation of his friends' affairs the patience of a collector and the science of a naturalist; and his sister, Miss Sophy Jackson, who lived with him, and was entertained by all the people who could not secure her much-sought-after brother, brought home bits of minor gossip that filled out usefully the gaps in his picture. Therefore, whenever anything happened that Mrs. Archer wanted to know about, she asked Mr. Jackson to dine; and as she honoured few people with her invitations, and as she and her daughter Janey were an excellent audience, Mr. Jackson usually came himself instead of sending his sister. If he could have dictated all the conditions, he would have chosen the evenings when Newland was out; not because the young man was uncongenial to him (the two got on capitally at their club) but because the old anecdotist sometimes felt, on Newland's part, a tendency to weigh his evidence that the ladies of the family never showed. Mr. Jackson, if perfection had been attainable on earth, would also have asked that Mrs. Archer's food should be a little better. But then New York, as far back as the mind of man could travel, had been divided into the two great fundamental groups of the Mingotts and Mansons and all their clan, who cared about eating and clothes and money, and the Archer-Newland- van-der-Luyden tribe, who were devoted to travel, horticulture and the best fiction, and looked down on the grosser forms of pleasure. You couldn't have everything, after all. If you dined with the Lovell Mingotts you got canvas-back and terrapin and vintage wines; at Adeline Archer's you could talk about Alpine scenery and ""The Marble Faun""; and luckily the Archer Madeira had gone round the Cape. Therefore when a friendly summons came from Mrs. Archer, Mr. Jackson, who was a true eclectic, would usually say to his sister: ""I've been a little gouty since my last dinner at the Lovell Mingotts'--it will do me good to diet at Adeline's."" Mrs. Archer, who had long been a widow, lived with her son and daughter in West Twenty-eighth Street. An upper floor was dedicated to Newland, and the two women squeezed themselves into narrower quarters below. In an unclouded harmony of tastes and interests they cultivated ferns in Wardian cases, made macrame lace and wool embroidery on linen, collected American revolutionary glazed ware, subscribed to ""Good Words,"" and read Ouida's novels for the sake of the Italian atmosphere. (They preferred those about peasant life, because of the descriptions of scenery and the pleasanter sentiments, though in general they liked novels about people in society, whose motives and habits were more comprehensible, spoke severely of Dickens, who ""had never drawn a gentleman,"" and considered Thackeray less at home in the great world than Bulwer--who, however, was beginning to be thought old-fashioned.) Mrs. and Miss Archer were both great lovers of scenery. It was what they principally sought and admired on their occasional travels abroad; considering architecture and painting as subjects for men, and chiefly for learned persons who read Ruskin. Mrs. Archer had been born a Newland, and mother and daughter, who were as like as sisters, were both, as people said, ""true Newlands""; tall, pale, and slightly round-shouldered, with long noses, sweet smiles and a kind of drooping distinction like that in certain faded Reynolds portraits. Their physical resemblance would have been complete if an elderly embonpoint had not stretched Mrs. Archer's black brocade, while Miss Archer's brown and purple poplins hung, as the years went on, more and more slackly on her virgin frame. Mentally, the likeness between them, as Newland was aware, was less complete than their identical mannerisms often made it appear. The long habit of living together in mutually dependent intimacy had given them the same vocabulary, and the same habit of beginning their phrases ""Mother thinks"" or ""Janey thinks,"" according as one or the other wished to advance an opinion of her own; but in reality, while Mrs. Archer's serene unimaginativeness rested easily in the accepted and familiar, Janey was subject to starts and aberrations of fancy welling up from springs of suppressed romance. Mother and daughter adored each other and revered their son and brother; and Archer loved them with a tenderness made compunctious and uncritical by the sense of their exaggerated admiration, and by his secret satisfaction in it. After all, he thought it a good thing for a man to have his authority respected in his own house, even if his sense of humour sometimes made him question the force of his mandate. On this occasion the young man was very sure that Mr. Jackson would rather have had him dine out; but he had his own reasons for not doing so. Of course old Jackson wanted to talk about Ellen Olenska, and of course Mrs. Archer and Janey wanted to hear what he had to tell. All three would be slightly embarrassed by Newland's presence, now that his prospective relation to the Mingott clan had been made known; and the young man waited with an amused curiosity to see how they would turn the difficulty. They began, obliquely, by talking about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers. ""It's a pity the Beauforts asked her,"" Mrs. Archer said gently. ""But then Regina always does what he tells her; and BEAUFORT--"" ""Certain nuances escape Beaufort,"" said Mr. Jackson, cautiously inspecting the broiled shad, and wondering for the thousandth time why Mrs. Archer's cook always burnt the roe to a cinder. (Newland, who had long shared his wonder, could always detect it in the older man's expression of melancholy disapproval.) ""Oh, necessarily; Beaufort is a vulgar man,"" said Mrs. Archer. ""My grandfather Newland always used to say to my mother: `Whatever you do, don't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls.' But at least he's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen; in England too, they say. It's all very mysterious--"" She glanced at Janey and paused. She and Janey knew every fold of the Beaufort mystery, but in public Mrs. Archer continued to assume that the subject was not one for the unmarried. ""But this Mrs. Struthers,"" Mrs. Archer continued; ""what did you say SHE was, Sillerton?"" ""Out of a mine: or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit. Then with Living Wax-Works, touring New England. After the police broke THAT up, they say she lived--"" Mr. Jackson in his turn glanced at Janey, whose eyes began to bulge from under her prominent lids. There were still hiatuses for her in Mrs. Struthers's past. ""Then,"" Mr. Jackson continued (and Archer saw he was wondering why no one had told the butler never to slice cucumbers with a steel knife), ""then Lemuel Struthers came along. They say his advertiser used the girl's head for the shoe-polish posters; her hair's intensely black, you know--the Egyptian style. Anyhow, he-- eventually--married her."" There were volumes of innuendo in the way the ""eventually"" was spaced, and each syllable given its due stress. ""Oh, well--at the pass we've come to nowadays, it doesn't matter,"" said Mrs. Archer indifferently. The ladies were not really interested in Mrs. Struthers just then; the subject of Ellen Olenska was too fresh and too absorbing to them. Indeed, Mrs. Struthers's name had been introduced by Mrs. Archer only that she might presently be able to say: ""And Newland's new cousin--Countess Olenska? Was SHE at the ball too?"" There was a faint touch of sarcasm in the reference to her son, and Archer knew it and had expected it. Even Mrs. Archer, who was seldom unduly pleased with human events, had been altogether glad of her son's engagement. (""Especially after that silly business with Mrs. Rushworth,"" as she had remarked to Janey, alluding to what had once seemed to Newland a tragedy of which his soul would always bear the scar.) There was no better match in New York than May Welland, look at the question from whatever point you chose. Of course such a marriage was only what Newland was entitled to; but young men are so foolish and incalculable--and some women so ensnaring and unscrupulous--that it was nothing short of a miracle to see one's only son safe past the Siren Isle and in the haven of a blameless domesticity. All this Mrs. Archer felt, and her son knew she felt; but he knew also that she had been perturbed by the premature announcement of his engagement, or rather by its cause; and it was for that reason--because on the whole he was a tender and indulgent master--that he had stayed at home that evening. ""It's not that I don't approve of the Mingotts' esprit de corps; but why Newland's engagement should be mixed up with that Olenska woman's comings and goings I don't see,"" Mrs. Archer grumbled to Janey, the only witness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness. She had behaved beautifully--and in beautiful behaviour she was unsurpassed--during the call on Mrs. Welland; but Newland knew (and his betrothed doubtless guessed) that all through the visit she and Janey were nervously on the watch for Madame Olenska's possible intrusion; and when they left the house together she had permitted herself to say to her son: ""I'm thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone."" These indications of inward disturbance moved Archer the more that he too felt that the Mingotts had gone a little too far. But, as it was against all the rules of their code that the mother and son should ever allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts, he simply replied: ""Oh, well, there's always a phase of family parties to be gone through when one gets engaged, and the sooner it's over the better."" At which his mother merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that hung down from her grey velvet bonnet trimmed with frosted grapes. Her revenge, he felt--her lawful revenge--would be to ""draw"" Mr. Jackson that evening on the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly done his duty as a future member of the Mingott clan, the young man had no objection to hearing the lady discussed in private--except that the subject was already beginning to bore him. Mr. Jackson had helped himself to a slice of the tepid filet which the mournful butler had handed him with a look as sceptical as his own, and had rejected the mushroom sauce after a scarcely perceptible sniff. He looked baffled and hungry, and Archer reflected that he would probably finish his meal on Ellen Olenska. Mr. Jackson leaned back in his chair, and glanced up at the candlelit Archers, Newlands and van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on the dark walls. ""Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a good dinner, my dear Newland!"" he said, his eyes on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man in a stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-columned country-house behind him. ""Well--well--well . . . I wonder what he would have said to all these foreign marriages!"" Mrs. Archer ignored the allusion to the ancestral cuisine and Mr. Jackson continued with deliberation: ""No, she was NOT at the ball."" ""Ah--"" Mrs. Archer murmured, in a tone that implied: ""She had that decency."" ""Perhaps the Beauforts don't know her,"" Janey suggested, with her artless malice. Mr. Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had been tasting invisible Madeira. ""Mrs. Beaufort may not--but Beaufort certainly does, for she was seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the whole of New York."" ""Mercy--"" moaned Mrs. Archer, evidently perceiving the uselessness of trying to ascribe the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy. ""I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon,"" Janey speculated. ""At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet, perfectly plain and flat-- like a night-gown."" ""Janey!"" said her mother; and Miss Archer blushed and tried to look audacious. ""It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go to the ball,"" Mrs. Archer continued. A spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin: ""I don't think it was a question of taste with her. May said she meant to go, and then decided that the dress in question wasn't smart enough."" Mrs. Archer smiled at this confirmation of her inference. ""Poor Ellen,"" she simply remarked; adding compassionately: ""We must always bear in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora Manson gave her. What can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming-out ball?"" ""Ah--don't I remember her in it!"" said Mr. Jackson; adding: ""Poor girl!"" in the tone of one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully understood at the time what the sight portended. ""It's odd,"" Janey remarked, ""that she should have kept such an ugly name as Ellen. I should have changed it to Elaine."" She glanced about the table to see the effect of this. Her brother laughed. ""Why Elaine?"" ""I don't know; it sounds more--more Polish,"" said Janey, blushing. ""It sounds more conspicuous; and that can hardly be what she wishes,"" said Mrs. Archer distantly. ""Why not?"" broke in her son, growing suddenly argumentative. ""Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses? Why should she slink about as if it were she who had disgraced herself? She's `poor Ellen' certainly, because she had the bad luck to make a wretched marriage; but I don't see that that's a reason for hiding her head as if she were the culprit."" ""That, I suppose,"" said Mr. Jackson, speculatively, ""is the line the Mingotts mean to take."" The young man reddened. ""I didn't have to wait for their cue, if that's what you mean, sir. Madame Olenska has had an unhappy life: that doesn't make her an outcast."" ""There are rumours,"" began Mr. Jackson, glancing at Janey. ""Oh, I know: the secretary,"" the young man took him up. ""Nonsense, mother; Janey's grown-up. They say, don't they,"" he went on, ""that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband, who kept her practically a prisoner? Well, what if he did? I hope there isn't a man among us who wouldn't have done the same in such a case."" Mr. Jackson glanced over his shoulder to say to the sad butler: ""Perhaps . . . that sauce . . . just a little, after all--""; then, having helped himself, he remarked: ""I'm told she's looking for a house. She means to live here."" ""I hear she means to get a divorce,"" said Janey boldly. ""I hope she will!"" Archer exclaimed. The word had fallen like a bombshell in the pure and tranquil atmosphere of the Archer dining-room. Mrs. Archer raised her delicate eye-brows in the particular curve that signified: ""The butler--"" and the young man, himself mindful of the bad taste of discussing such intimate matters in public, hastily branched off into an account of his visit to old Mrs. Mingott. After dinner, according to immemorial custom, Mrs. Archer and Janey trailed their long silk draperies up to the drawing-room, where, while the gentlemen smoked below stairs, they sat beside a Carcel lamp with an engraved globe, facing each other across a rosewood work-table with a green silk bag under it, and stitched at the two ends of a tapestry band of field-flowers destined to adorn an ""occasional"" chair in the drawing- room of young Mrs. Newland Archer. While this rite was in progress in the drawing-room, Archer settled Mr. Jackson in an armchair near the fire in the Gothic library and handed him a cigar. Mr. Jackson sank into the armchair with satisfaction, lit his cigar with perfect confidence (it was Newland who bought them), and stretching his thin old ankles to the coals, said: ""You say the secretary merely helped her to get away, my dear fellow? Well, he was still helping her a year later, then; for somebody met 'em living at Lausanne together."" Newland reddened. ""Living together? Well, why not? Who had the right to make her life over if she hadn't? I'm sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots."" He stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar. ""Women ought to be free--as free as we are,"" he declared, making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences. Mr. Sillerton Jackson stretched his ankles nearer the coals and emitted a sardonic whistle. ""Well,"" he said after a pause, ""apparently Count Olenski takes your view; for I never heard of his having lifted a finger to get his wife back.""  VI. That evening, after Mr. Jackson had taken himself away, and the ladies had retired to their chintz- curtained bedroom, Newland Archer mounted thoughtfully to his own study. A vigilant hand had, as usual, kept the fire alive and the lamp trimmed; and the room, with its rows and rows of books, its bronze and steel statuettes of ""The Fencers"" on the mantelpiece and its many photographs of famous pictures, looked singularly home-like and welcoming. As he dropped into his armchair near the fire his eyes rested on a large photograph of May Welland, which the young girl had given him in the first days of their romance, and which had now displaced all the other portraits on the table. With a new sense of awe he looked at the frank forehead, serious eyes and gay innocent mouth of the young creature whose soul's custodian he was to be. That terrifying product of the social system he belonged to and believed in, the young girl who knew nothing and expected everything, looked back at him like a stranger through May Welland's familiar features; and once more it was borne in on him that marriage was not the safe anchorage he had been taught to think, but a voyage on uncharted seas. The case of the Countess Olenska had stirred up old settled convictions and set them drifting dangerously through his mind. His own exclamation: ""Women should be free--as free as we are,"" struck to the root of a problem that it was agreed in his world to regard as non-existent. ""Nice"" women, however wronged, would never claim the kind of freedom he meant, and generous- minded men like himself were therefore--in the heat of argument--the more chivalrously ready to concede it to them. Such verbal generosities were in fact only a humbugging disguise of the inexorable conventions that tied things together and bound people down to the old pattern. But here he was pledged to defend, on the part of his betrothed's cousin, conduct that, on his own wife's part, would justify him in calling down on her all the thunders of Church and State. Of course the dilemma was purely hypothetical; since he wasn't a blackguard Polish nobleman, it was absurd to speculate what his wife's rights would be if he WERE. But Newland Archer was too imaginative not to feel that, in his case and May's, the tie might gall for reasons far less gross and palpable. What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a ""decent"" fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal? What if, for some one of the subtler reasons that would tell with both of them, they should tire of each other, misunderstand or irritate each other? He reviewed his friends' marriages-- the supposedly happy ones--and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other. Lawrence Lefferts occurred to him as the husband who had most completely realised this enviable ideal. As became the high-priest of form, he had formed a wife so completely to his own convenience that, in the most conspicuous moments of his frequent love-affairs with other men's wives, she went about in smiling unconsciousness, saying that ""Lawrence was so frightfully strict""; and had been known to blush indignantly, and avert her gaze, when some one alluded in her presence to the fact that Julius Beaufort (as became a ""foreigner"" of doubtful origin) had what was known in New York as ""another establishment."" Archer tried to console himself with the thought that he was not quite such an ass as Larry Lefferts, nor May such a simpleton as poor Gertrude; but the difference was after all one of intelligence and not of standards. In reality they all lived in a kind of hieroglyphic world, where the real thing was never said or done or even thought, but only represented by a set of arbitrary signs; as when Mrs. Welland, who knew exactly why Archer had pressed her to announce her daughter's engagement at the Beaufort ball (and had indeed expected him to do no less), yet felt obliged to simulate reluctance, and the air of having had her hand forced, quite as, in the books on Primitive Man that people of advanced culture were beginning to read, the savage bride is dragged with shrieks from her parents' tent. The result, of course, was that the young girl who was the centre of this elaborate system of mystification remained the more inscrutable for her very frankness and assurance. She was frank, poor darling, because she had nothing to conceal, assured because she knew of nothing to be on her guard against; and with no better preparation than this, she was to be plunged overnight into what people evasively called ""the facts of life."" The young man was sincerely but placidly in love. He delighted in the radiant good looks of his betrothed, in her health, her horsemanship, her grace and quickness at games, and the shy interest in books and ideas that she was beginning to develop under his guidance. (She had advanced far enough to join him in ridiculing the Idyls of the King, but not to feel the beauty of Ulysses and the Lotus Eaters.) She was straightforward, loyal and brave; she had a sense of humour (chiefly proved by her laughing at HIS jokes); and he suspected, in the depths of her innocently-gazing soul, a glow of feeling that it would be a joy to waken. But when he had gone the brief round of her he returned discouraged by the thought that all this frankness and innocence were only an artificial product. Untrained human nature was not frank and innocent; it was full of the twists and defences of an instinctive guile. And he felt himself oppressed by this creation of factitious purity, so cunningly manufactured by a conspiracy of mothers and aunts and grandmothers and long-dead ancestresses, because it was supposed to be what he wanted, what he had a right to, in order that he might exercise his lordly pleasure in smashing it like an image made of snow. There was a certain triteness in these reflections: they were those habitual to young men on the approach of their wedding day. But they were generally accompanied by a sense of compunction and self-abasement of which Newland Archer felt no trace. He could not deplore (as Thackeray's heroes so often exasperated him by doing) that he had not a blank page to offer his bride in exchange for the unblemished one she was to give to him. He could not get away from the fact that if he had been brought up as she had they would have been no more fit to find their way about than the Babes in the Wood; nor could he, for all his anxious cogitations, see any honest reason (any, that is, unconnected with his own momentary pleasure, and the passion of masculine vanity) why his bride should not have been allowed the same freedom of experience as himself. Such questions, at such an hour, were bound to drift through his mind; but he was conscious that their uncomfortable persistence and precision were due to the inopportune arrival of the Countess Olenska. Here he was, at the very moment of his betrothal--a moment for pure thoughts and cloudless hopes--pitchforked into a coil of scandal which raised all the special problems he would have preferred to let lie. ""Hang Ellen Olenska!"" he grumbled, as he covered his fire and began to undress. He could not really see why her fate should have the least bearing on his; yet he dimly felt that he had only just begun to measure the risks of the championship which his engagement had forced upon him.  A few days later the bolt fell. The Lovell Mingotts had sent out cards for what was known as ""a formal dinner"" (that is, three extra footmen, two dishes for each course, and a Roman punch in the middle), and had headed their invitations with the words ""To meet the Countess Olenska,"" in accordance with the hospitable American fashion, which treats strangers as if they were royalties, or at least as their ambassadors. The guests had been selected with a boldness and discrimination in which the initiated recognised the firm hand of Catherine the Great. Associated with such immemorial standbys as the Selfridge Merrys, who were asked everywhere because they always had been, the Beauforts, on whom there was a claim of relationship, and Mr. Sillerton Jackson and his sister Sophy (who went wherever her brother told her to), were some of the most fashionable and yet most irreproachable of the dominant ""young married"" set; the Lawrence Leffertses, Mrs. Lefferts Rushworth (the lovely widow), the Harry Thorleys, the Reggie Chiverses and young Morris Dagonet and his wife (who was a van der Luyden). The company indeed was perfectly assorted, since all the members belonged to the little inner group of people who, during the long New York season, disported themselves together daily and nightly with apparently undiminished zest. Forty-eight hours later the unbelievable had happened; every one had refused the Mingotts' invitation except the Beauforts and old Mr. Jackson and his sister. The intended slight was emphasised by the fact that even the Reggie Chiverses, who were of the Mingott clan, were among those inflicting it; and by the uniform wording of the notes, in all of which the writers ""regretted that they were unable to accept,"" without the mitigating plea of a ""previous engagement"" that ordinary courtesy prescribed. New York society was, in those days, far too small, and too scant in its resources, for every one in it (including livery-stable-keepers, butlers and cooks) not to know exactly on which evenings people were free; and it was thus possible for the recipients of Mrs. Lovell Mingott's invitations to make cruelly clear their determination not to meet the Countess Olenska. The blow was unexpected; but the Mingotts, as their way was, met it gallantly. Mrs. Lovell Mingott confided the case to Mrs. Welland, who confided it to Newland Archer; who, aflame at the outrage, appealed passionately and authoritatively to his mother; who, after a painful period of inward resistance and outward temporising, succumbed to his instances (as she always did), and immediately embracing his cause with an energy redoubled by her previous hesitations, put on her grey velvet bonnet and said: ""I'll go and see Louisa van der Luyden."" The New York of Newland Archer's day was a small and slippery pyramid, in which, as yet, hardly a fissure had been made or a foothold gained. At its base was a firm foundation of what Mrs. Archer called ""plain people""; an honourable but obscure majority of respectable families who (as in the case of the Spicers or the Leffertses or the Jacksons) had been raised above their level by marriage with one of the ruling clans. People, Mrs. Archer always said, were not as particular as they used to be; and with old Catherine Spicer ruling one end of Fifth Avenue, and Julius Beaufort the other, you couldn't expect the old traditions to last much longer. Firmly narrowing upward from this wealthy but inconspicuous substratum was the compact and dominant group which the Mingotts, Newlands, Chiverses and Mansons so actively represented. Most people imagined them to be the very apex of the pyramid; but they themselves (at least those of Mrs. Archer's generation) were aware that, in the eyes of the professional genealogist, only a still smaller number of families could lay claim to that eminence. ""Don't tell me,"" Mrs. Archer would say to her children, ""all this modern newspaper rubbish about a New York aristocracy. If there is one, neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it; no, nor the Newlands or the Chiverses either. Our grandfathers and great- grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants, who came to the colonies to make their fortune, and stayed here because they did so well. One of your great-grandfathers signed the Declaration, and another was a general on Washington's staff, and received General Burgoyne's sword after the battle of Saratoga. These are things to be proud of, but they have nothing to do with rank or class. New York has always been a commercial community, and there are not more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word."" Mrs. Archer and her son and daughter, like every one else in New York, knew who these privileged beings were: the Dagonets of Washington Square, who came of an old English county family allied with the Pitts and Foxes; the Lannings, who had intermarried with the descendants of Count de Grasse, and the van der Luydens, direct descendants of the first Dutch governor of Manhattan, and related by pre-revolutionary marriages to several members of the French and British aristocracy. The Lannings survived only in the person of two very old but lively Miss Lannings, who lived cheerfully and reminiscently among family portraits and Chippendale; the Dagonets were a considerable clan, allied to the best names in Baltimore and Philadelphia; but the van der Luydens, who stood above all of them, had faded into a kind of super-terrestrial twilight, from which only two figures impressively emerged; those of Mr. and Mrs. Henry van der Luyden. Mrs. Henry van der Luyden had been Louisa Dagonet, and her mother had been the granddaughter of Colonel du Lac, of an old Channel Island family, who had fought under Cornwallis and had settled in Maryland, after the war, with his bride, Lady Angelica Trevenna, fifth daughter of the Earl of St. Austrey. The tie between the Dagonets, the du Lacs of Maryland, and their aristocratic Cornish kinsfolk, the Trevennas, had always remained close and cordial. Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had more than once paid long visits to the present head of the house of Trevenna, the Duke of St. Austrey, at his country-seat in Cornwall and at St. Austrey in Gloucestershire; and his Grace had frequently announced his intention of some day returning their visit (without the Duchess, who feared the Atlantic). Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden divided their time between Trevenna, their place in Maryland, and Skuytercliff, the great estate on the Hudson which had been one of the colonial grants of the Dutch government to the famous first Governor, and of which Mr. van der Luyden was still ""Patroon."" Their large solemn house in Madison Avenue was seldom opened, and when they came to town they received in it only their most intimate friends. ""I wish you would go with me, Newland,"" his mother said, suddenly pausing at the door of the Brown coupe. ""Louisa is fond of you; and of course it's on account of dear May that I'm taking this step--and also because, if we don't all stand together, there'll be no such thing as Society left.""  VII. Mrs. Henry van der Luyden listened in silence to her cousin Mrs. Archer's narrative. It was all very well to tell yourself in advance that Mrs. van der Luyden was always silent, and that, though non-committal by nature and training, she was very kind to the people she really liked. Even personal experience of these facts was not always a protection from the chill that descended on one in the high-ceilinged white-walled Madison Avenue drawing-room, with the pale brocaded armchairs so obviously uncovered for the occasion, and the gauze still veiling the ormolu mantel ornaments and the beautiful old carved frame of Gainsborough's ""Lady Angelica du Lac."" Mrs. van der Luyden's portrait by Huntington (in black velvet and Venetian point) faced that of her lovely ancestress. It was generally considered ""as fine as a Cabanel,"" and, though twenty years had elapsed since its execution, was still ""a perfect likeness."" Indeed the Mrs. van der Luyden who sat beneath it listening to Mrs. Archer might have been the twin-sister of the fair and still youngish woman drooping against a gilt armchair before a green rep curtain. Mrs. van der Luyden still wore black velvet and Venetian point when she went into society--or rather (since she never dined out) when she threw open her own doors to receive it. Her fair hair, which had faded without turning grey, was still parted in flat overlapping points on her forehead, and the straight nose that divided her pale blue eyes was only a little more pinched about the nostrils than when the portrait had been painted. She always, indeed, struck Newland Archer as having been rather gruesomely preserved in the airless atmosphere of a perfectly irreproachable existence, as bodies caught in glaciers keep for years a rosy life-in-death. Like all his family, he esteemed and admired Mrs. van der Luyden; but he found her gentle bending sweetness less approachable than the grimness of some of his mother's old aunts, fierce spinsters who said ""No"" on principle before they knew what they were going to be asked. Mrs. van der Luyden's attitude said neither yes nor no, but always appeared to incline to clemency till her thin lips, wavering into the shadow of a smile, made the almost invariable reply: ""I shall first have to talk this over with my husband."" She and Mr. van der Luyden were so exactly alike that Archer often wondered how, after forty years of the closest conjugality, two such merged identities ever separated themselves enough for anything as controversial as a talking-over. But as neither had ever reached a decision without prefacing it by this mysterious conclave, Mrs. Archer and her son, having set forth their case, waited resignedly for the familiar phrase. Mrs. van der Luyden, however, who had seldom surprised any one, now surprised them by reaching her long hand toward the bell-rope. ""I think,"" she said, ""I should like Henry to hear what you have told me."" A footman appeared, to whom she gravely added: ""If Mr. van der Luyden has finished reading the newspaper, please ask him to be kind enough to come."" She said ""reading the newspaper"" in the tone in which a Minister's wife might have said: ""Presiding at a Cabinet meeting""--not from any arrogance of mind, but because the habit of a life-time, and the attitude of her friends and relations, had led her to consider Mr. van der Luyden's least gesture as having an almost sacerdotal importance. Her promptness of action showed that she considered the case as pressing as Mrs. Archer; but, lest she should be thought to have committed herself in advance, she added, with the sweetest look: ""Henry always enjoys seeing you, dear Adeline; and he will wish to congratulate Newland."" The double doors had solemnly reopened and between them appeared Mr. Henry van der Luyden, tall, spare and frock-coated, with faded fair hair, a straight nose like his wife's and the same look of frozen gentleness in eyes that were merely pale grey instead of pale blue. Mr. van der Luyden greeted Mrs. Archer with cousinly affability, proffered to Newland low-voiced congratulations couched in the same language as his wife's, and seated himself in one of the brocade armchairs with the simplicity of a reigning sovereign. ""I had just finished reading the Times,"" he said, laying his long finger-tips together. ""In town my mornings are so much occupied that I find it more convenient to read the newspapers after luncheon."" ""Ah, there's a great deal to be said for that plan-- indeed I think my uncle Egmont used to say he found it less agitating not to read the morning papers till after dinner,"" said Mrs. Archer responsively. ""Yes: my good father abhorred hurry. But now we live in a constant rush,"" said Mr. van der Luyden in measured tones, looking with pleasant deliberation about the large shrouded room which to Archer was so complete an image of its owners. ""But I hope you HAD finished your reading, Henry?"" his wife interposed. ""Quite--quite,"" he reassured her. ""Then I should like Adeline to tell you--"" ""Oh, it's really Newland's story,"" said his mother smiling; and proceeded to rehearse once more the monstrous tale of the affront inflicted on Mrs. Lovell Mingott. ""Of course,"" she ended, ""Augusta Welland and Mary Mingott both felt that, especially in view of Newland's engagement, you and Henry OUGHT TO KNOW."" ""Ah--"" said Mr. van der Luyden, drawing a deep breath. There was a silence during which the tick of the monumental ormolu clock on the white marble mantelpiece grew as loud as the boom of a minute-gun. Archer contemplated with awe the two slender faded figures, seated side by side in a kind of viceregal rigidity, mouthpieces of some remote ancestral authority which fate compelled them to wield, when they would so much rather have lived in simplicity and seclusion, digging invisible weeds out of the perfect lawns of Skuytercliff, and playing Patience together in the evenings. Mr. van der Luyden was the first to speak. ""You really think this is due to some--some intentional interference of Lawrence Lefferts's?"" he enquired, turning to Archer. ""I'm certain of it, sir. Larry has been going it rather harder than usual lately--if cousin Louisa won't mind my mentioning it--having rather a stiff affair with the postmaster's wife in their village, or some one of that sort; and whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins to suspect anything, and he's afraid of trouble, he gets up a fuss of this kind, to show how awfully moral he is, and talks at the top of his voice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he doesn't wish her to know. He's simply using Madame Olenska as a lightning-rod; I've seen him try the same thing often before."" ""The LEFFERTSES!--"" said Mrs. van der Luyden. ""The LEFFERTSES!--"" echoed Mrs. Archer. ""What would uncle Egmont have said of Lawrence Lefferts's pronouncing on anybody's social position? It shows what Society has come to."" ""We'll hope it has not quite come to that,"" said Mr. van der Luyden firmly. ""Ah, if only you and Louisa went out more!"" sighed Mrs. Archer. But instantly she became aware of her mistake. The van der Luydens were morbidly sensitive to any criticism of their secluded existence. They were the arbiters of fashion, the Court of last Appeal, and they knew it, and bowed to their fate. But being shy and retiring persons, with no natural inclination for their part, they lived as much as possible in the sylvan solitude of Skuytercliff, and when they came to town, declined all invitations on the plea of Mrs. van der Luyden's health. Newland Archer came to his mother's rescue. ""Everybody in New York knows what you and cousin Louisa represent. That's why Mrs. Mingott felt she ought not to allow this slight on Countess Olenska to Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton pass without consulting you."" Mrs. van der Luyden glanced at her husband, who glanced back at her. ""It is the principle that I dislike,"" said Mr. van der Luyden. ""As long as a member of a well-known family is backed up by that family it should be considered-- final."" ""It seems so to me,"" said his wife, as if she were producing a new thought. ""I had no idea,"" Mr. van der Luyden continued, ""that things had come to such a pass."" He paused, and looked at his wife again. ""It occurs to me, my dear, that the Countess Olenska is already a sort of relation-- through Medora Manson's first husband. At any rate, she will be when Newland marries."" He turned toward the young man. ""Have you read this morning's Times, Newland?"" ""Why, yes, sir,"" said Archer, who usually tossed off half a dozen papers with his morning coffee. Husband and wife looked at each other again. Their pale eyes clung together in prolonged and serious consultation; then a faint smile fluttered over Mrs. van der Luyden's face. She had evidently guessed and approved. Mr. van der Luyden turned to Mrs. Archer. ""If Louisa's health allowed her to dine out--I wish you would say to Mrs. Lovell Mingott--she and I would have been happy to--er--fill the places of the Lawrence Leffertses at her dinner."" He paused to let the irony of this sink in. ""As you know, this is impossible."" Mrs. Archer sounded a sympathetic assent. ""But Newland tells me he has read this morning's Times; therefore he has probably seen that Louisa's relative, the Duke of St. Austrey, arrives next week on the Russia. He is coming to enter his new sloop, the Guinevere, in next summer's International Cup Race; and also to have a little canvasback shooting at Trevenna."" Mr. van der Luyden paused again, and continued with increasing benevolence: ""Before taking him down to Maryland we are inviting a few friends to meet him here--only a little dinner--with a reception afterward. I am sure Louisa will be as glad as I am if Countess Olenska will let us include her among our guests."" He got up, bent his long body with a stiff friendliness toward his cousin, and added: ""I think I have Louisa's authority for saying that she will herself leave the invitation to dine when she drives out presently: with our cards--of course with our cards."" Mrs. Archer, who knew this to be a hint that the seventeen-hand chestnuts which were never kept waiting were at the door, rose with a hurried murmur of thanks. Mrs. van der Luyden beamed on her with the smile of Esther interceding with Ahasuerus; but her husband raised a protesting hand. ""There is nothing to thank me for, dear Adeline; nothing whatever. This kind of thing must not happen in New York; it shall not, as long as I can help it,"" he pronounced with sovereign gentleness as he steered his cousins to the door. Two hours later, every one knew that the great C-spring barouche in which Mrs. van der Luyden took the air at all seasons had been seen at old Mrs. Mingott's door, where a large square envelope was handed in; and that evening at the Opera Mr. Sillerton Jackson was able to state that the envelope contained a card inviting the Countess Olenska to the dinner which the van der Luydens were giving the following week for their cousin, the Duke of St. Austrey. Some of the younger men in the club box exchanged a smile at this announcement, and glanced sideways at Lawrence Lefferts, who sat carelessly in the front of the box, pulling his long fair moustache, and who remarked with authority, as the soprano paused: ""No one but Patti ought to attempt the Sonnambula.""  VIII. It was generally agreed in New York that the Countess Olenska had ""lost her looks."" She had appeared there first, in Newland Archer's boyhood, as a brilliantly pretty little girl of nine or ten, of whom people said that she ""ought to be painted."" Her parents had been continental wanderers, and after a roaming babyhood she had lost them both, and been taken in charge by her aunt, Medora Manson, also a wanderer, who was herself returning to New York to ""settle down."" Poor Medora, repeatedly widowed, was always coming home to settle down (each time in a less expensive house), and bringing with her a new husband or an adopted child; but after a few months she invariably parted from her husband or quarrelled with her ward, and, having got rid of her house at a loss, set out again on her wanderings. As her mother had been a Rushworth, and her last unhappy marriage had linked her to one of the crazy Chiverses, New York looked indulgently on her eccentricities; but when she returned with her little orphaned niece, whose parents had been popular in spite of their regrettable taste for travel, people thought it a pity that the pretty child should be in such hands. Every one was disposed to be kind to little Ellen Mingott, though her dusky red cheeks and tight curls gave her an air of gaiety that seemed unsuitable in a child who should still have been in black for her parents. It was one of the misguided Medora's many peculiarities to flout the unalterable rules that regulated American mourning, and when she stepped from the steamer her family were scandalised to see that the crape veil she wore for her own brother was seven inches shorter than those of her sisters-in-law, while little Ellen was in crimson merino and amber beads, like a gipsy foundling. But New York had so long resigned itself to Medora that only a few old ladies shook their heads over Ellen's gaudy clothes, while her other relations fell under the charm of her high colour and high spirits. She was a fearless and familiar little thing, who asked disconcerting questions, made precocious comments, and possessed outlandish arts, such as dancing a Spanish shawl dance and singing Neapolitan love-songs to a guitar. Under the direction of her aunt (whose real name was Mrs. Thorley Chivers, but who, having received a Papal title, had resumed her first husband's patronymic, and called herself the Marchioness Manson, because in Italy she could turn it into Manzoni) the little girl received an expensive but incoherent education, which included ""drawing from the model,"" a thing never dreamed of before, and playing the piano in quintets with professional musicians. Of course no good could come of this; and when, a few years later, poor Chivers finally died in a mad- house, his widow (draped in strange weeds) again pulled up stakes and departed with Ellen, who had grown into a tall bony girl with conspicuous eyes. For some time no more was heard of them; then news came of Ellen's marriage to an immensely rich Polish nobleman of legendary fame, whom she had met at a ball at the Tuileries, and who was said to have princely establishments in Paris, Nice and Florence, a yacht at Cowes, and many square miles of shooting in Transylvania. She disappeared in a kind of sulphurous apotheosis, and when a few years later Medora again came back to New York, subdued, impoverished, mourning a third husband, and in quest of a still smaller house, people wondered that her rich niece had not been able to do something for her. Then came the news that Ellen's own marriage had ended in disaster, and that she was herself returning home to seek rest and oblivion among her kinsfolk. These things passed through Newland Archer's mind a week later as he watched the Countess Olenska enter the van der Luyden drawing-room on the evening of the momentous dinner. The occasion was a solemn one, and he wondered a little nervously how she would carry it off. She came rather late, one hand still ungloved, and fastening a bracelet about her wrist; yet she entered without any appearance of haste or embarrassment the drawing-room in which New York's most chosen company was somewhat awfully assembled. In the middle of the room she paused, looking about her with a grave mouth and smiling eyes; and in that instant Newland Archer rejected the general verdict on her looks. It was true that her early radiance was gone. The red cheeks had paled; she was thin, worn, a little older-looking than her age, which must have been nearly thirty. But there was about her the mysterious authority of beauty, a sureness in the carriage of the head, the movement of the eyes, which, without being in the least theatrical, struck his as highly trained and full of a conscious power. At the same time she was simpler in manner than most of the ladies present, and many people (as he heard afterward from Janey) were disappointed that her appearance was not more ""stylish"" --for stylishness was what New York most valued. It was, perhaps, Archer reflected, because her early vivacity had disappeared; because she was so quiet--quiet in her movements, her voice, and the tones of her low- pitched voice. New York had expected something a good deal more reasonant in a young woman with such a history. The dinner was a somewhat formidable business. Dining with the van der Luydens was at best no light matter, and dining there with a Duke who was their cousin was almost a religious solemnity. It pleased Archer to think that only an old New Yorker could perceive the shade of difference (to New York) between being merely a Duke and being the van der Luydens' Duke. New York took stray noblemen calmly, and even (except in the Struthers set) with a certain distrustful hauteur; but when they presented such credentials as these they were received with an old-fashioned cordiality that they would have been greatly mistaken in ascribing solely to their standing in Debrett. It was for just such distinctions that the young man cherished his old New York even while he smiled at it. The van der Luydens had done their best to emphasise the importance of the occasion. The du Lac Sevres and the Trevenna George II plate were out; so was the van der Luyden ""Lowestoft"" (East India Company) and the Dagonet Crown Derby. Mrs. van der Luyden looked more than ever like a Cabanel, and Mrs. Archer, in her grandmother's seed-pearls and emeralds, reminded her son of an Isabey miniature. All the ladies had on their handsomest jewels, but it was characteristic of the house and the occasion that these were mostly in rather heavy old-fashioned settings; and old Miss Lanning, who had been persuaded to come, actually wore her mother's cameos and a Spanish blonde shawl. The Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers. It frightened him to think what must have gone to the making of her eyes. The Duke of St. Austrey, who sat at his hostess's right, was naturally the chief figure of the evening. But if the Countess Olenska was less conspicuous than had been hoped, the Duke was almost invisible. Being a well-bred man he had not (like another recent ducal visitor) come to the dinner in a shooting-jacket; but his evening clothes were so shabby and baggy, and he wore them with such an air of their being homespun, that (with his stooping way of sitting, and the vast beard spreading over his shirt-front) he hardly gave the appearance of being in dinner attire. He was short, round-shouldered, sunburnt, with a thick nose, small eyes and a sociable smile; but he seldom spoke, and when he did it was in such low tones that, despite the frequent silences of expectation about the table, his remarks were lost to all but his neighbours. When the men joined the ladies after dinner the Duke went straight up to the Countess Olenska, and they sat down in a corner and plunged into animated talk. Neither seemed aware that the Duke should first have paid his respects to Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Headly Chivers, and the Countess have conversed with that amiable hypochondriac, Mr. Urban Dagonet of Washington Square, who, in order to have the pleasure of meeting her, had broken through his fixed rule of not dining out between January and April. The two chatted together for nearly twenty minutes; then the Countess rose and, walking alone across the wide drawing-room, sat down at Newland Archer's side. It was not the custom in New York drawing-rooms for a lady to get up and walk away from one gentleman in order to seek the company of another. Etiquette required that she should wait, immovable as an idol, while the men who wished to converse with her succeeded each other at her side. But the Countess was apparently unaware of having broken any rule; she sat at perfect ease in a corner of the sofa beside Archer, and looked at him with the kindest eyes. ""I want you to talk to me about May,"" she said. Instead of answering her he asked: ""You knew the Duke before?"" ""Oh, yes--we used to see him every winter at Nice. He's very fond of gambling--he used to come to the house a great deal."" She said it in the simplest manner, as if she had said: ""He's fond of wild-flowers""; and after a moment she added candidly: ""I think he's the dullest man I ever met."" This pleased her companion so much that he forgot the slight shock her previous remark had caused him. It was undeniably exciting to meet a lady who found the van der Luydens' Duke dull, and dared to utter the opinion. He longed to question her, to hear more about the life of which her careless words had given him so illuminating a glimpse; but he feared to touch on distressing memories, and before he could think of anything to say she had strayed back to her original subject. ""May is a darling; I've seen no young girl in New York so handsome and so intelligent. Are you very much in love with her?"" Newland Archer reddened and laughed. ""As much as a man can be."" She continued to consider him thoughtfully, as if not to miss any shade of meaning in what he said, ""Do you think, then, there is a limit?"" ""To being in love? If there is, I haven't found it!"" She glowed with sympathy. ""Ah--it's really and truly a romance?"" ""The most romantic of romances!"" ""How delightful! And you found it all out for yourselves--it was not in the least arranged for you?"" Archer looked at her incredulously. ""Have you forgotten,"" he asked with a smile, ""that in our country we don't allow our marriages to be arranged for us?"" A dusky blush rose to her cheek, and he instantly regretted his words. ""Yes,"" she answered, ""I'd forgotten. You must forgive me if I sometimes make these mistakes. I don't always remember that everything here is good that was--that was bad where I've come from."" She looked down at her Viennese fan of eagle feathers, and he saw that her lips trembled. ""I'm so sorry,"" he said impulsively; ""but you ARE among friends here, you know."" ""Yes--I know. Wherever I go I have that feeling. That's why I came home. I want to forget everything else, to become a complete American again, like the Mingotts and Wellands, and you and your delightful mother, and all the other good people here tonight. Ah, here's May arriving, and you will want to hurry away to her,"" she added, but without moving; and her eyes turned back from the door to rest on the young man's face. The drawing-rooms were beginning to fill up with after-dinner guests, and following Madame Olenska's glance Archer saw May Welland entering with her mother. In her dress of white and silver, with a wreath of silver blossoms in her hair, the tall girl looked like a Diana just alight from the chase. ""Oh,"" said Archer, ""I have so many rivals; you see she's already surrounded. There's the Duke being introduced."" ""Then stay with me a little longer,"" Madame Olenska said in a low tone, just touching his knee with her plumed fan. It was the lightest touch, but it thrilled him like a caress. ""Yes, let me stay,"" he answered in the same tone, hardly knowing what he said; but just then Mr. van der Luyden came up, followed by old Mr. Urban Dagonet. The Countess greeted them with her grave smile, and Archer, feeling his host's admonitory glance on him, rose and surrendered his seat. Madame Olenska held out her hand as if to bid him goodbye. ""Tomorrow, then, after five--I shall expect you,"" she said; and then turned back to make room for Mr. Dagonet. ""Tomorrow--"" Archer heard himself repeating, though there had been no engagement, and during their talk she had given him no hint that she wished to see him again. As he moved away he saw Lawrence Lefferts, tall and resplendent, leading his wife up to be introduced; and heard Gertrude Lefferts say, as she beamed on the Countess with her large unperceiving smile: ""But I think we used to go to dancing-school together when we were children--."" Behind her, waiting their turn to name themselves to the Countess, Archer noticed a number of the recalcitrant couples who had declined to meet her at Mrs. Lovell Mingott's. As Mrs. Archer remarked: when the van der Luydens chose, they knew how to give a lesson. The wonder was that they chose so seldom. The young man felt a touch on his arm and saw Mrs. van der Luyden looking down on him from the pure eminence of black velvet and the family diamonds. ""It was good of you, dear Newland, to devote yourself so unselfishly to Madame Olenska. I told your cousin Henry he must really come to the rescue."" He was aware of smiling at her vaguely, and she added, as if condescending to his natural shyness: ""I've never seen May looking lovelier. The Duke thinks her the handsomest girl in the room.""  IX. The Countess Olenska had said ""after five""; and at half after the hour Newland Archer rang the bell of the peeling stucco house with a giant wisteria throttling its feeble cast-iron balcony, which she had hired, far down West Twenty-third Street, from the vagabond Medora. It was certainly a strange quarter to have settled in. Small dress-makers, bird-stuffers and ""people who wrote"" were her nearest neighbours; and further down the dishevelled street Archer recognised a dilapidated wooden house, at the end of a paved path, in which a writer and journalist called Winsett, whom he used to come across now and then, had mentioned that he lived. Winsett did not invite people to his house; but he had once pointed it out to Archer in the course of a nocturnal stroll, and the latter had asked himself, with a little shiver, if the humanities were so meanly housed in other capitals. Madame Olenska's own dwelling was redeemed from the same appearance only by a little more paint about the window-frames; and as Archer mustered its modest front he said to himself that the Polish Count must have robbed her of her fortune as well as of her illusions. The young man had spent an unsatisfactory day. He had lunched with the Wellands, hoping afterward to carry off May for a walk in the Park. He wanted to have her to himself, to tell her how enchanting she had looked the night before, and how proud he was of her, and to press her to hasten their marriage. But Mrs. Welland had firmly reminded him that the round of family visits was not half over, and, when he hinted at advancing the date of the wedding, had raised reproachful eye-brows and sighed out: ""Twelve dozen of everything--hand-embroidered--"" Packed in the family landau they rolled from one tribal doorstep to another, and Archer, when the afternoon's round was over, parted from his betrothed with the feeling that he had been shown off like a wild animal cunningly trapped. He supposed that his readings in anthropology caused him to take such a coarse view of what was after all a simple and natural demonstration of family feeling; but when he remembered that the Wellands did not expect the wedding to take place till the following autumn, and pictured what his life would be till then, a dampness fell upon his spirit. ""Tomorrow,"" Mrs. Welland called after him, ""we'll do the Chiverses and the Dallases""; and he perceived that she was going through their two families alphabetically, and that they were only in the first quarter of the alphabet. He had meant to tell May of the Countess Olenska's request--her command, rather--that he should call on her that afternoon; but in the brief moments when they were alone he had had more pressing things to say. Besides, it struck him as a little absurd to allude to the matter. He knew that May most particularly wanted him to be kind to her cousin; was it not that wish which had hastened the announcement of their engagement? It gave him an odd sensation to reflect that, but for the Countess's arrival, he might have been, if not still a free man, at least a man less irrevocably pledged. But May had willed it so, and he felt himself somehow relieved of further responsibility--and therefore at liberty, if he chose, to call on her cousin without telling her. As he stood on Madame Olenska's threshold curiosity was his uppermost feeling. He was puzzled by the tone in which she had summoned him; he concluded that she was less simple than she seemed. The door was opened by a swarthy foreign-looking maid, with a prominent bosom under a gay neckerchief, whom he vaguely fancied to be Sicilian. She welcomed him with all her white teeth, and answering his enquiries by a head-shake of incomprehension led him through the narrow hall into a low firelit drawing- room. The room was empty, and she left him, for an appreciable time, to wonder whether she had gone to find her mistress, or whether she had not understood what he was there for, and thought it might be to wind the clock--of which he perceived that the only visible specimen had stopped. He knew that the southern races communicated with each other in the language of pantomime, and was mortified to find her shrugs and smiles so unintelligible. At length she returned with a lamp; and Archer, having meanwhile put together a phrase out of Dante and Petrarch, evoked the answer: ""La signora e fuori; ma verra subito""; which he took to mean: ""She's out--but you'll soon see."" What he saw, meanwhile, with the help of the lamp, was the faded shadowy charm of a room unlike any room he had known. He knew that the Countess Olenska had brought some of her possessions with her--bits of wreckage, she called them--and these, he supposed, were represented by some small slender tables of dark wood, a delicate little Greek bronze on the chimney- piece, and a stretch of red damask nailed on the discoloured wallpaper behind a couple of Italian-looking pictures in old frames. Newland Archer prided himself on his knowledge of Italian art. His boyhood had been saturated with Ruskin, and he had read all the latest books: John Addington Symonds, Vernon Lee's ""Euphorion,"" the essays of P. G. Hamerton, and a wonderful new volume called ""The Renaissance"" by Walter Pater. He talked easily of Botticelli, and spoke of Fra Angelico with a faint condescension. But these pictures bewildered him, for they were like nothing that he was accustomed to look at (and therefore able to see) when he travelled in Italy; and perhaps, also, his powers of observation were impaired by the oddness of finding himself in this strange empty house, where apparently no one expected him. He was sorry that he had not told May Welland of Countess Olenska's request, and a little disturbed by the thought that his betrothed might come in to see her cousin. What would she think if she found him sitting there with the air of intimacy implied by waiting alone in the dusk at a lady's fireside? But since he had come he meant to wait; and he sank into a chair and stretched his feet to the logs. It was odd to have summoned him in that way, and then forgotten him; but Archer felt more curious than mortified. The atmosphere of the room was so different from any he had ever breathed that self-consciousness vanished in the sense of adventure. He had been before in drawing-rooms hung with red damask, with pictures ""of the Italian school""; what struck him was the way in which Medora Manson's shabby hired house, with its blighted background of pampas grass and Rogers statuettes, had, by a turn of the hand, and the skilful use of a few properties, been transformed into something intimate, ""foreign,"" subtly suggestive of old romantic scenes and sentiments. He tried to analyse the trick, to find a clue to it in the way the chairs and tables were grouped, in the fact that only two Jacqueminot roses (of which nobody ever bought less than a dozen) had been placed in the slender vase at his elbow, and in the vague pervading perfume that was not what one put on handkerchiefs, but rather like the scent of some far-off bazaar, a smell made up of Turkish coffee and ambergris and dried roses. His mind wandered away to the question of what May's drawing-room would look like. He knew that Mr. Welland, who was behaving ""very handsomely,"" already had his eye on a newly built house in East Thirty-ninth Street. The neighbourhood was thought remote, and the house was built in a ghastly greenish- yellow stone that the younger architects were beginning to employ as a protest against the brownstone of which the uniform hue coated New York like a cold chocolate sauce; but the plumbing was perfect. Archer would have liked to travel, to put off the housing question; but, though the Wellands approved of an extended European honeymoon (perhaps even a winter in Egypt), they were firm as to the need of a house for the returning couple. The young man felt that his fate was sealed: for the rest of his life he would go up every evening between the cast-iron railings of that greenish- yellow doorstep, and pass through a Pompeian vestibule into a hall with a wainscoting of varnished yellow wood. But beyond that his imagination could not travel. He knew the drawing-room above had a bay window, but he could not fancy how May would deal with it. She submitted cheerfully to the purple satin and yellow tuftings of the Welland drawing-room, to its sham Buhl tables and gilt vitrines full of modern Saxe. He saw no reason to suppose that she would want anything different in her own house; and his only comfort was to reflect that she would probably let him arrange his library as he pleased--which would be, of course, with ""sincere"" Eastlake furniture, and the plain new bookcases without glass doors. The round-bosomed maid came in, drew the curtains, pushed back a log, and said consolingly: ""Verra--verra."" When she had gone Archer stood up and began to wander about. Should he wait any longer? His position was becoming rather foolish. Perhaps he had misunderstood Madame Olenska--perhaps she had not invited him after all. Down the cobblestones of the quiet street came the ring of a stepper's hoofs; they stopped before the house, and he caught the opening of a carriage door. Parting the curtains he looked out into the early dusk. A street- lamp faced him, and in its light he saw Julius Beaufort's compact English brougham, drawn by a big roan, and the banker descending from it, and helping out Madame Olenska. Beaufort stood, hat in hand, saying something which his companion seemed to negative; then they shook hands, and he jumped into his carriage while she mounted the steps. When she entered the room she showed no surprise at seeing Archer there; surprise seemed the emotion that she was least addicted to. ""How do you like my funny house?"" she asked. ""To me it's like heaven."" As she spoke she untied her little velvet bonnet and tossing it away with her long cloak stood looking at him with meditative eyes. ""You've arranged it delightfully,"" he rejoined, alive to the flatness of the words, but imprisoned in the conventional by his consuming desire to be simple and striking. ""Oh, it's a poor little place. My relations despise it. But at any rate it's less gloomy than the van der Luydens'."" The words gave him an electric shock, for few were the rebellious spirits who would have dared to call the stately home of the van der Luydens gloomy. Those privileged to enter it shivered there, and spoke of it as ""handsome."" But suddenly he was glad that she had given voice to the general shiver. ""It's delicious--what you've done here,"" he repeated. ""I like the little house,"" she admitted; ""but I suppose what I like is the blessedness of its being here, in my own country and my own town; and then, of being alone in it."" She spoke so low that he hardly heard the last phrase; but in his awkwardness he took it up. ""You like so much to be alone?"" ""Yes; as long as my friends keep me from feeling lonely."" She sat down near the fire, said: ""Nastasia will bring the tea presently,"" and signed to him to return to his armchair, adding: ""I see you've already chosen your corner."" Leaning back, she folded her arms behind her head, and looked at the fire under drooping lids. ""This is the hour I like best--don't you?"" A proper sense of his dignity caused him to answer: ""I was afraid you'd forgotten the hour. Beaufort must have been very engrossing."" She looked amused. ""Why--have you waited long? Mr. Beaufort took me to see a number of houses-- since it seems I'm not to be allowed to stay in this one."" She appeared to dismiss both Beaufort and himself from her mind, and went on: ""I've never been in a city where there seems to be such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques. What does it matter where one lives? I'm told this street is respectable."" ""It's not fashionable."" ""Fashionable! Do you all think so much of that? Why not make one's own fashions? But I suppose I've lived too independently; at any rate, I want to do what you all do--I want to feel cared for and safe."" He was touched, as he had been the evening before when she spoke of her need of guidance. ""That's what your friends want you to feel. New York's an awfully safe place,"" he added with a flash of sarcasm. ""Yes, isn't it? One feels that,"" she cried, missing the mockery. ""Being here is like--like--being taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all one's lessons."" The analogy was well meant, but did not altogether please him. He did not mind being flippant about New York, but disliked to hear any one else take the same tone. He wondered if she did not begin to see what a powerful engine it was, and how nearly it had crushed her. The Lovell Mingotts' dinner, patched up in extremis out of all sorts of social odds and ends, ought to have taught her the narrowness of her escape; but either she had been all along unaware of having skirted disaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van der Luyden evening. Archer inclined to the former theory; he fancied that her New York was still completely undifferentiated, and the conjecture nettled him. ""Last night,"" he said, ""New York laid itself out for you. The van der Luydens do nothing by halves."" ""No: how kind they are! It was such a nice party. Every one seems to have such an esteem for them."" The terms were hardly adequate; she might have spoken in that way of a tea-party at the dear old Miss Lannings'. ""The van der Luydens,"" said Archer, feeling himself pompous as he spoke, ""are the most powerful influence in New York society. Unfortunately--owing to her health--they receive very seldom."" She unclasped her hands from behind her head, and looked at him meditatively. ""Isn't that perhaps the reason?"" ""The reason--?"" ""For their great influence; that they make themselves so rare."" He coloured a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration of the remark. At a stroke she had pricked the van der Luydens and they collapsed. He laughed, and sacrificed them. Nastasia brought the tea, with handleless Japanese cups and little covered dishes, placing the tray on a low table. ""But you'll explain these things to me--you'll tell me all I ought to know,"" Madame Olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his cup. ""It's you who are telling me; opening my eyes to things I'd looked at so long that I'd ceased to see them."" She detached a small gold cigarette-case from one of her bracelets, held it out to him, and took a cigarette herself. On the chimney were long spills for lighting them. ""Ah, then we can both help each other. But I want help so much more. You must tell me just what to do."" It was on the tip of his tongue to reply: ""Don't be seen driving about the streets with Beaufort--"" but he was being too deeply drawn into the atmosphere of the room, which was her atmosphere, and to give advice of that sort would have been like telling some one who was bargaining for attar-of-roses in Samarkand that one should always be provided with arctics for a New York winter. New York seemed much farther off than Samarkand, and if they were indeed to help each other she was rendering what might prove the first of their mutual services by making him look at his native city objectively. Viewed thus, as through the wrong end of a telescope, it looked disconcertingly small and distant; but then from Samarkand it would. A flame darted from the logs and she bent over the fire, stretching her thin hands so close to it that a faint halo shone about the oval nails. The light touched to russet the rings of dark hair escaping from her braids, and made her pale face paler. ""There are plenty of people to tell you what to do,"" Archer rejoined, obscurely envious of them. ""Oh--all my aunts? And my dear old Granny?"" She considered the idea impartially. ""They're all a little vexed with me for setting up for myself--poor Granny especially. She wanted to keep me with her; but I had to be free--"" He was impressed by this light way of speaking of the formidable Catherine, and moved by the thought of what must have given Madame Olenska this thirst for even the loneliest kind of freedom. But the idea of Beaufort gnawed him. ""I think I understand how you feel,"" he said. ""Still, your family can advise you; explain differences; show you the way."" She lifted her thin black eyebrows. ""Is New York such a labyrinth? I thought it so straight up and down-- like Fifth Avenue. And with all the cross streets numbered!"" She seemed to guess his faint disapproval of this, and added, with the rare smile that enchanted her whole face: ""If you knew how I like it for just THAT-- the straight-up-and-downness, and the big honest labels on everything!"" He saw his chance. ""Everything may be labelled-- but everybody is not."" ""Perhaps. I may simplify too much--but you'll warn me if I do."" She turned from the fire to look at him. ""There are only two people here who make me feel as if they understood what I mean and could explain things to me: you and Mr. Beaufort."" Archer winced at the joining of the names, and then, with a quick readjustment, understood, sympathised and pitied. So close to the powers of evil she must have lived that she still breathed more freely in their air. But since she felt that he understood her also, his business would be to make her see Beaufort as he really was, with all he represented--and abhor it. He answered gently: ""I understand. But just at first don't let go of your old friends' hands: I mean the older women, your Granny Mingott, Mrs. Welland, Mrs. van der Luyden. They like and admire you--they want to help you."" She shook her head and sighed. ""Oh, I know--I know! But on condition that they don't hear anything unpleasant. Aunt Welland put it in those very words when I tried. . . . Does no one want to know the truth here, Mr. Archer? The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!"" She lifted her hands to her face, and he saw her thin shoulders shaken by a sob. ""Madame Olenska!--Oh, don't, Ellen,"" he cried, starting up and bending over her. He drew down one of her hands, clasping and chafing it like a child's while he murmured reassuring words; but in a moment she freed herself, and looked up at him with wet lashes. ""Does no one cry here, either? I suppose there's no need to, in heaven,"" she said, straightening her loosened braids with a laugh, and bending over the tea- kettle. It was burnt into his consciousness that he had called her ""Ellen""--called her so twice; and that she had not noticed it. Far down the inverted telescope he saw the faint white figure of May Welland--in New York. Suddenly Nastasia put her head in to say something in her rich Italian. Madame Olenska, again with a hand at her hair, uttered an exclamation of assent--a flashing ""Gia-- gia""--and the Duke of St. Austrey entered, piloting a tremendous blackwigged and red-plumed lady in overflowing furs. ""My dear Countess, I've brought an old friend of mine to see you--Mrs. Struthers. She wasn't asked to the party last night, and she wants to know you."" The Duke beamed on the group, and Madame Olenska advanced with a murmur of welcome toward the queer couple. She seemed to have no idea how oddly matched they were, nor what a liberty the Duke had taken in bringing his companion--and to do him justice, as Archer perceived, the Duke seemed as unaware of it himself. ""Of course I want to know you, my dear,"" cried Mrs. Struthers in a round rolling voice that matched her bold feathers and her brazen wig. ""I want to know everybody who's young and interesting and charming. And the Duke tells me you like music--didn't you, Duke? You're a pianist yourself, I believe? Well, do you want to hear Sarasate play tomorrow evening at my house? You know I've something going on every Sunday evening--it's the day when New York doesn't know what to do with itself, and so I say to it: `Come and be amused.' And the Duke thought you'd be tempted by Sarasate. You'll find a number of your friends."" Madame Olenska's face grew brilliant with pleasure. ""How kind! How good of the Duke to think of me!"" She pushed a chair up to the tea-table and Mrs. Struthers sank into it delectably. ""Of course I shall be too happy to come."" ""That's all right, my dear. And bring your young gentleman with you."" Mrs. Struthers extended a hail- fellow hand to Archer. ""I can't put a name to you--but I'm sure I've met you--I've met everybody, here, or in Paris or London. Aren't you in diplomacy? All the diplomatists come to me. You like music too? Duke, you must be sure to bring him."" The Duke said ""Rather"" from the depths of his beard, and Archer withdrew with a stiffly circular bow that made him feel as full of spine as a self-conscious school-boy among careless and unnoticing elders. He was not sorry for the denouement of his visit: he only wished it had come sooner, and spared him a certain waste of emotion. As he went out into the wintry night, New York again became vast and imminent, and May Welland the loveliest woman in it. He turned into his florist's to send her the daily box of lilies-of-the-valley which, to his confusion, he found he had forgotten that morning. As he wrote a word on his card and waited for an envelope he glanced about the embowered shop, and his eye lit on a cluster of yellow roses. He had never seen any as sun-golden before, and his first impulse was to send them to May instead of the lilies. But they did not look like her--there was something too rich, too strong, in their fiery beauty. In a sudden revulsion of mood, and almost without knowing what he did, he signed to the florist to lay the roses in another long box, and slipped his card into a second envelope, on which he wrote the name of the Countess Olenska; then, just as he was turning away, he drew the card out again, and left the empty envelope on the box. ""They'll go at once?"" he enquired, pointing to the roses. The florist assured him that they would.  X. The next day he persuaded May to escape for a walk in the Park after luncheon. As was the custom in old-fashioned Episcopalian New York, she usually accompanied her parents to church on Sunday afternoons; but Mrs. Welland condoned her truancy, having that very morning won her over to the necessity of a long engagement, with time to prepare a hand-embroidered trousseau containing the proper number of dozens. The day was delectable. The bare vaulting of trees along the Mall was ceiled with lapis lazuli, and arched above snow that shone like splintered crystals. It was the weather to call out May's radiance, and she burned like a young maple in the frost. Archer was proud of the glances turned on her, and the simple joy of possessorship cleared away his underlying perplexities. ""It's so delicious--waking every morning to smell lilies-of-the-valley in one's room!"" she said. ""Yesterday they came late. I hadn't time in the morning--"" ""But your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much more than if you'd given a standing order, and they came every morning on the minute, like one's music-teacher--as I know Gertrude Lefferts's did, for instance, when she and Lawrence were engaged."" ""Ah--they would!"" laughed Archer, amused at her keenness. He looked sideways at her fruit-like cheek and felt rich and secure enough to add: ""When I sent your lilies yesterday afternoon I saw some rather gorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to Madame Olenska. Was that right?"" ""How dear of you! Anything of that kind delights her. It's odd she didn't mention it: she lunched with us today, and spoke of Mr. Beaufort's having sent her wonderful orchids, and cousin Henry van der Luyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff. She seems so surprised to receive flowers. Don't people send them in Europe? She thinks it such a pretty custom."" ""Oh, well, no wonder mine were overshadowed by Beaufort's,"" said Archer irritably. Then he remembered that he had not put a card with the roses, and was vexed at having spoken of them. He wanted to say: ""I called on your cousin yesterday,"" but hesitated. If Madame Olenska had not spoken of his visit it might seem awkward that he should. Yet not to do so gave the affair an air of mystery that he disliked. To shake off the question he began to talk of their own plans, their future, and Mrs. Welland's insistence on a long engagement. ""If you call it long! Isabel Chivers and Reggie were engaged for two years: Grace and Thorley for nearly a year and a half. Why aren't we very well off as we are?"" It was the traditional maidenly interrogation, and he felt ashamed of himself for finding it singularly childish. No doubt she simply echoed what was said for her; but she was nearing her twenty-second birthday, and he wondered at what age ""nice"" women began to speak for themselves. ""Never, if we won't let them, I suppose,"" he mused, and recalled his mad outburst to Mr. Sillerton Jackson: ""Women ought to be as free as we are--"" It would presently be his task to take the bandage from this young woman's eyes, and bid her look forth on the world. But how many generations of the women who had gone to her making had descended bandaged to the family vault? He shivered a little, remembering some of the new ideas in his scientific books, and the much-cited instance of the Kentucky cave-fish, which had ceased to develop eyes because they had no use for them. What if, when he had bidden May Welland to open hers, they could only look out blankly at blankness? ""We might be much better off. We might be altogether together--we might travel."" Her face lit up. ""That would be lovely,"" she owned: she would love to travel. But her mother would not understand their wanting to do things so differently. ""As if the mere `differently' didn't account for it!"" the wooer insisted. ""Newland! You're so original!"" she exulted. His heart sank, for he saw that he was saying all the things that young men in the same situation were expected to say, and that she was making the answers that instinct and tradition taught her to make--even to the point of calling him original. ""Original! We're all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper. We're like patterns stencilled on a wall. Can't you and I strike out for ourselves, May?"" He had stopped and faced her in the excitement of their discussion, and her eyes rested on him with a bright unclouded admiration. ""Mercy--shall we elope?"" she laughed. ""If you would--"" ""You DO love me, Newland! I'm so happy."" ""But then--why not be happier?"" ""We can't behave like people in novels, though, can we?"" ""Why not--why not--why not?"" She looked a little bored by his insistence. She knew very well that they couldn't, but it was troublesome to have to produce a reason. ""I'm not clever enough to argue with you. But that kind of thing is rather--vulgar, isn't it?"" she suggested, relieved to have hit on a word that would assuredly extinguish the whole subject. ""Are you so much afraid, then, of being vulgar?"" She was evidently staggered by this. ""Of course I should hate it--so would you,"" she rejoined, a trifle irritably. He stood silent, beating his stick nervously against his boot-top; and feeling that she had indeed found the right way of closing the discussion, she went on light- heartedly: ""Oh, did I tell you that I showed Ellen my ring? She thinks it the most beautiful setting she ever saw. There's nothing like it in the rue de la Paix, she said. I do love you, Newland, for being so artistic!""  The next afternoon, as Archer, before dinner, sat smoking sullenly in his study, Janey wandered in on him. He had failed to stop at his club on the way up from the office where he exercised the profession of the law in the leisurely manner common to well-to-do New Yorkers of his class. He was out of spirits and slightly out of temper, and a haunting horror of doing the same thing every day at the same hour besieged his brain. ""Sameness--sameness!"" he muttered, the word running through his head like a persecuting tune as he saw the familiar tall-hatted figures lounging behind the plate- glass; and because he usually dropped in at the club at that hour he had gone home instead. He knew not only what they were likely to be talking about, but the part each one would take in the discussion. The Duke of course would be their principal theme; though the appearance in Fifth Avenue of a golden-haired lady in a small canary-coloured brougham with a pair of black cobs (for which Beaufort was generally thought responsible) would also doubtless be thoroughly gone into. Such ""women"" (as they were called) were few in New York, those driving their own carriages still fewer, and the appearance of Miss Fanny Ring in Fifth Avenue at the fashionable hour had profoundly agitated society. Only the day before, her carriage had passed Mrs. Lovell Mingott's, and the latter had instantly rung the little bell at her elbow and ordered the coachman to drive her home. ""What if it had happened to Mrs. van der Luyden?"" people asked each other with a shudder. Archer could hear Lawrence Lefferts, at that very hour, holding forth on the disintegration of society. He raised his head irritably when his sister Janey entered, and then quickly bent over his book (Swinburne's ""Chastelard""--just out) as if he had not seen her. She glanced at the writing-table heaped with books, opened a volume of the ""Contes Drolatiques,"" made a wry face over the archaic French, and sighed: ""What learned things you read!"" ""Well--?"" he asked, as she hovered Cassandra-like before him. ""Mother's very angry."" ""Angry? With whom? About what?"" ""Miss Sophy Jackson has just been here. She brought word that her brother would come in after dinner: she couldn't say very much, because he forbade her to: he wishes to give all the details himself. He's with cousin Louisa van der Luyden now."" ""For heaven's sake, my dear girl, try a fresh start. It would take an omniscient Deity to know what you're talking about."" ""It's not a time to be profane, Newland. . . . Mother feels badly enough about your not going to church . . ."" With a groan he plunged back into his book. ""NEWLAND! Do listen. Your friend Madame Olenska was at Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's party last night: she went there with the Duke and Mr. Beaufort."" At the last clause of this announcement a senseless anger swelled the young man's breast. To smother it he laughed. ""Well, what of it? I knew she meant to."" Janey paled and her eyes began to project. ""You knew she meant to--and you didn't try to stop her? To warn her?"" ""Stop her? Warn her?"" He laughed again. ""I'm not engaged to be married to the Countess Olenska!"" The words had a fantastic sound in his own ears. ""You're marrying into her family."" ""Oh, family--family!"" he jeered. ""Newland--don't you care about Family?"" ""Not a brass farthing."" ""Nor about what cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think?"" ""Not the half of one--if she thinks such old maid's rubbish."" ""Mother is not an old maid,"" said his virgin sister with pinched lips. He felt like shouting back: ""Yes, she is, and so are the van der Luydens, and so we all are, when it comes to being so much as brushed by the wing-tip of Reality."" But he saw her long gentle face puckering into tears, and felt ashamed of the useless pain he was inflicting. ""Hang Countess Olenska! Don't be a goose, Janey-- I'm not her keeper."" ""No; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so that we might all back her up; and if it hadn't been for that cousin Louisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke."" ""Well--what harm was there in inviting her? She was the best-looking woman in the room; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the usual van der Luyden banquet."" ""You know cousin Henry asked her to please you: he persuaded cousin Louisa. And now they're so upset that they're going back to Skuytercliff tomorrow. I think, Newland, you'd better come down. You don't seem to understand how mother feels."" In the drawing-room Newland found his mother. She raised a troubled brow from her needlework to ask: ""Has Janey told you?"" ""Yes."" He tried to keep his tone as measured as her own. ""But I can't take it very seriously."" ""Not the fact of having offended cousin Louisa and cousin Henry?"" ""The fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as Countess Olenska's going to the house of a woman they consider common."" ""Consider--!"" ""Well, who is; but who has good music, and amuses people on Sunday evenings, when the whole of New York is dying of inanition."" ""Good music? All I know is, there was a woman who got up on a table and sang the things they sing at the places you go to in Paris. There was smoking and champagne."" ""Well--that kind of thing happens in other places, and the world still goes on."" ""I don't suppose, dear, you're really defending the French Sunday?"" ""I've heard you often enough, mother, grumble at the English Sunday when we've been in London."" ""New York is neither Paris nor London."" ""Oh, no, it's not!"" her son groaned. ""You mean, I suppose, that society here is not as brilliant? You're right, I daresay; but we belong here, and people should respect our ways when they come among us. Ellen Olenska especially: she came back to get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies."" Newland made no answer, and after a moment his mother ventured: ""I was going to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin Louisa for a moment before dinner."" He frowned, and she continued: ""I thought you might explain to her what you've just said: that society abroad is different . . . that people are not as particular, and that Madame Olenska may not have realised how we feel about such things. It would be, you know, dear,"" she added with an innocent adroitness, ""in Madame Olenska's interest if you did."" ""Dearest mother, I really don't see how we're concerned in the matter. The Duke took Madame Olenska to Mrs. Struthers's--in fact he brought Mrs. Struthers to call on her. I was there when they came. If the van der Luydens want to quarrel with anybody, the real culprit is under their own roof."" ""Quarrel? Newland, did you ever know of cousin Henry's quarrelling? Besides, the Duke's his guest; and a stranger too. Strangers don't discriminate: how should they? Countess Olenska is a New Yorker, and should have respected the feelings of New York."" ""Well, then, if they must have a victim, you have my leave to throw Madame Olenska to them,"" cried her son, exasperated. ""I don't see myself--or you either-- offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes."" ""Oh, of course you see only the Mingott side,"" his mother answered, in the sensitive tone that was her nearest approach to anger. The sad butler drew back the drawing-room portieres and announced: ""Mr. Henry van der Luyden."" Mrs. Archer dropped her needle and pushed her chair back with an agitated hand. ""Another lamp,"" she cried to the retreating servant, while Janey bent over to straighten her mother's cap. Mr. van der Luyden's figure loomed on the threshold, and Newland Archer went forward to greet his cousin. ""We were just talking about you, sir,"" he said. Mr. van der Luyden seemed overwhelmed by the announcement. He drew off his glove to shake hands with the ladies, and smoothed his tall hat shyly, while Janey pushed an arm-chair forward, and Archer continued: ""And the Countess Olenska."" Mrs. Archer paled. ""Ah--a charming woman. I have just been to see her,"" said Mr. van der Luyden, complacency restored to his brow. He sank into the chair, laid his hat and gloves on the floor beside him in the old-fashioned way, and went on: ""She has a real gift for arranging flowers. I had sent her a few carnations from Skuytercliff, and I was astonished. Instead of massing them in big bunches as our head-gardener does, she had scattered them about loosely, here and there . . . I can't say how. The Duke had told me: he said: `Go and see how cleverly she's arranged her drawing-room.' And she has. I should really like to take Louisa to see her, if the neighbourhood were not so--unpleasant."" A dead silence greeted this unusual flow of words from Mr. van der Luyden. Mrs. Archer drew her embroidery out of the basket into which she had nervously tumbled it, and Newland, leaning against the chimney-place and twisting a humming-bird-feather screen in his hand, saw Janey's gaping countenance lit up by the coming of the second lamp. ""The fact is,"" Mr. van der Luyden continued, stroking his long grey leg with a bloodless hand weighed down by the Patroon's great signet-ring, ""the fact is, I dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she wrote me about my flowers; and also--but this is between ourselves, of course--to give her a friendly warning about allowing the Duke to carry her off to parties with him. I don't know if you've heard--"" Mrs. Archer produced an indulgent smile. ""Has the Duke been carrying her off to parties?"" ""You know what these English grandees are. They're all alike. Louisa and I are very fond of our cousin--but it's hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions. The Duke goes where he's amused."" Mr. van der Luyden paused, but no one spoke. ""Yes--it seems he took her with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's. Sillerton Jackson has just been to us with the foolish story, and Louisa was rather troubled. So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess Olenska and explain--by the merest hint, you know--how we feel in New York about certain things. I felt I might, without indelicacy, because the evening she dined with us she rather suggested . . . rather let me see that she would be grateful for guidance. And she WAS."" Mr. van der Luyden looked about the room with what would have been self-satisfaction on features less purged of the vulgar passions. On his face it became a mild benevolence which Mrs. Archer's countenance dutifully reflected. ""How kind you both are, dear Henry--always! Newland will particularly appreciate what you have done because of dear May and his new relations."" She shot an admonitory glance at her son, who said: ""Immensely, sir. But I was sure you'd like Madame Olenska."" Mr. van der Luyden looked at him with extreme gentleness. ""I never ask to my house, my dear Newland,"" he said, ""any one whom I do not like. And so I have just told Sillerton Jackson."" With a glance at the clock he rose and added: ""But Louisa will be waiting. We are dining early, to take the Duke to the Opera."" After the portieres had solemnly closed behind their visitor a silence fell upon the Archer family. ""Gracious--how romantic!"" at last broke explosively from Janey. No one knew exactly what inspired her elliptic comments, and her relations had long since given up trying to interpret them. Mrs. Archer shook her head with a sigh. ""Provided it all turns out for the best,"" she said, in the tone of one who knows how surely it will not. ""Newland, you must stay and see Sillerton Jackson when he comes this evening: I really shan't know what to say to him."" ""Poor mother! But he won't come--"" her son laughed, stooping to kiss away her frown.  XI. Some two weeks later, Newland Archer, sitting in abstracted idleness in his private compartment of the office of Letterblair, Lamson and Low, attorneys at law, was summoned by the head of the firm. Old Mr. Letterblair, the accredited legal adviser of three generations of New York gentility, throned behind his mahogany desk in evident perplexity. As he stroked his closeclipped white whiskers and ran his hand through the rumpled grey locks above his jutting brows, his disrespectful junior partner thought how much he looked like the Family Physician annoyed with a patient whose symptoms refuse to be classified. ""My dear sir--"" he always addressed Archer as ""sir""--""I have sent for you to go into a little matter; a matter which, for the moment, I prefer not to mention either to Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood."" The gentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm; for, as was always the case with legal associations of old standing in New York, all the partners named on the office letter-head were long since dead; and Mr. Letterblair, for example, was, professionally speaking, his own grandson. He leaned back in his chair with a furrowed brow. ""For family reasons--"" he continued. Archer looked up. ""The Mingott family,"" said Mr. Letterblair with an explanatory smile and bow. ""Mrs. Manson Mingott sent for me yesterday. Her grand-daughter the Countess Olenska wishes to sue her husband for divorce. Certain papers have been placed in my hands."" He paused and drummed on his desk. ""In view of your prospective alliance with the family I should like to consult you--to consider the case with you--before taking any farther steps."" Archer felt the blood in his temples. He had seen the Countess Olenska only once since his visit to her, and then at the Opera, in the Mingott box. During this interval she had become a less vivid and importunate image, receding from his foreground as May Welland resumed her rightful place in it. He had not heard her divorce spoken of since Janey's first random allusion to it, and had dismissed the tale as unfounded gossip. Theoretically, the idea of divorce was almost as distasteful to him as to his mother; and he was annoyed that Mr. Letterblair (no doubt prompted by old Catherine Mingott) should be so evidently planning to draw him into the affair. After all, there were plenty of Mingott men for such jobs, and as yet he was not even a Mingott by marriage. He waited for the senior partner to continue. Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and drew out a packet. ""If you will run your eye over these papers--"" Archer frowned. ""I beg your pardon, sir; but just because of the prospective relationship, I should prefer your consulting Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood."" Mr. Letterblair looked surprised and slightly offended. It was unusual for a junior to reject such an opening. He bowed. ""I respect your scruple, sir; but in this case I believe true delicacy requires you to do as I ask. Indeed, the suggestion is not mine but Mrs. Manson Mingott's and her son's. I have seen Lovell Mingott; and also Mr. Welland. They all named you."" Archer felt his temper rising. He had been somewhat languidly drifting with events for the last fortnight, and letting May's fair looks and radiant nature obliterate the rather importunate pressure of the Mingott claims. But this behest of old Mrs. Mingott's roused him to a sense of what the clan thought they had the right to exact from a prospective son-in-law; and he chafed at the role. ""Her uncles ought to deal with this,"" he said. ""They have. The matter has been gone into by the family. They are opposed to the Countess's idea; but she is firm, and insists on a legal opinion."" The young man was silent: he had not opened the packet in his hand. ""Does she want to marry again?"" ""I believe it is suggested; but she denies it."" ""Then--"" ""Will you oblige me, Mr. Archer, by first looking through these papers? Afterward, when we have talked the case over, I will give you my opinion."" Archer withdrew reluctantly with the unwelcome documents. Since their last meeting he had half-unconsciously collaborated with events in ridding himself of the burden of Madame Olenska. His hour alone with her by the firelight had drawn them into a momentary intimacy on which the Duke of St. Austrey's intrusion with Mrs. Lemuel Struthers, and the Countess's joyous greeting of them, had rather providentially broken. Two days later Archer had assisted at the comedy of her reinstatement in the van der Luydens' favour, and had said to himself, with a touch of tartness, that a lady who knew how to thank all-powerful elderly gentlemen to such good purpose for a bunch of flowers did not need either the private consolations or the public championship of a young man of his small compass. To look at the matter in this light simplified his own case and surprisingly furbished up all the dim domestic virtues. He could not picture May Welland, in whatever conceivable emergency, hawking about her private difficulties and lavishing her confidences on strange men; and she had never seemed to him finer or fairer than in the week that followed. He had even yielded to her wish for a long engagement, since she had found the one disarming answer to his plea for haste. ""You know, when it comes to the point, your parents have always let you have your way ever since you were a little girl,"" he argued; and she had answered, with her clearest look: ""Yes; and that's what makes it so hard to refuse the very last thing they'll ever ask of me as a little girl."" That was the old New York note; that was the kind of answer he would like always to be sure of his wife's making. If one had habitually breathed the New York air there were times when anything less crystalline seemed stifling.  The papers he had retired to read did not tell him much in fact; but they plunged him into an atmosphere in which he choked and spluttered. They consisted mainly of an exchange of letters between Count Olenski's solicitors and a French legal firm to whom the Countess had applied for the settlement of her financial situation. There was also a short letter from the Count to his wife: after reading it, Newland Archer rose, jammed the papers back into their envelope, and reentered Mr. Letterblair's office. ""Here are the letters, sir. If you wish, I'll see Madame Olenska,"" he said in a constrained voice. ""Thank you--thank you, Mr. Archer. Come and dine with me tonight if you're free, and we'll go into the matter afterward: in case you wish to call on our client tomorrow."" Newland Archer walked straight home again that afternoon. It was a winter evening of transparent clearness, with an innocent young moon above the house- tops; and he wanted to fill his soul's lungs with the pure radiance, and not exchange a word with any one till he and Mr. Letterblair were closeted together after dinner. It was impossible to decide otherwise than he had done: he must see Madame Olenska himself rather than let her secrets be bared to other eyes. A great wave of compassion had swept away his indifference and impatience: she stood before him as an exposed and pitiful figure, to be saved at all costs from farther wounding herself in her mad plunges against fate. He remembered what she had told him of Mrs. Welland's request to be spared whatever was ""unpleasant"" in her history, and winced at the thought that it was perhaps this attitude of mind which kept the New York air so pure. ""Are we only Pharisees after all?"" he wondered, puzzled by the effort to reconcile his instinctive disgust at human vileness with his equally instinctive pity for human frailty. For the first time he perceived how elementary his own principles had always been. He passed for a young man who had not been afraid of risks, and he knew that his secret love-affair with poor silly Mrs. Thorley Rushworth had not been too secret to invest him with a becoming air of adventure. But Mrs. Rushworth was ""that kind of woman""; foolish, vain, clandestine by nature, and far more attracted by the secrecy and peril of the affair than by such charms and qualities as he possessed. When the fact dawned on him it nearly broke his heart, but now it seemed the redeeming feature of the case. The affair, in short, had been of the kind that most of the young men of his age had been through, and emerged from with calm consciences and an undisturbed belief in the abysmal distinction between the women one loved and respected and those one enjoyed--and pitied. In this view they were sedulously abetted by their mothers, aunts and other elderly female relatives, who all shared Mrs. Archer's belief that when ""such things happened"" it was undoubtedly foolish of the man, but somehow always criminal of the woman. All the elderly ladies whom Archer knew regarded any woman who loved imprudently as necessarily unscrupulous and designing, and mere simple- minded man as powerless in her clutches. The only thing to do was to persuade him, as early as possible, to marry a nice girl, and then trust to her to look after him. In the complicated old European communities, Archer began to guess, love-problems might be less simple and less easily classified. Rich and idle and ornamental societies must produce many more such situations; and there might even be one in which a woman naturally sensitive and aloof would yet, from the force of circumstances, from sheer defencelessness and loneliness, be drawn into a tie inexcusable by conventional standards. On reaching home he wrote a line to the Countess Olenska, asking at what hour of the next day she could receive him, and despatched it by a messenger-boy, who returned presently with a word to the effect that she was going to Skuytercliff the next morning to stay over Sunday with the van der Luydens, but that he would find her alone that evening after dinner. The note was written on a rather untidy half-sheet, without date or address, but her hand was firm and free. He was amused at the idea of her week-ending in the stately solitude of Skuytercliff, but immediately afterward felt that there, of all places, she would most feel the chill of minds rigorously averted from the ""unpleasant.""  He was at Mr. Letterblair's punctually at seven, glad of the pretext for excusing himself soon after dinner. He had formed his own opinion from the papers entrusted to him, and did not especially want to go into the matter with his senior partner. Mr. Letterblair was a widower, and they dined alone, copiously and slowly, in a dark shabby room hung with yellowing prints of ""The Death of Chatham"" and ""The Coronation of Napoleon."" On the sideboard, between fluted Sheraton knife-cases, stood a decanter of Haut Brion, and another of the old Lanning port (the gift of a client), which the wastrel Tom Lanning had sold off a year or two before his mysterious and discreditable death in San Francisco--an incident less publicly humiliating to the family than the sale of the cellar. After a velvety oyster soup came shad and cucumbers, then a young broiled turkey with corn fritters, followed by a canvas-back with currant jelly and a celery mayonnaise. Mr. Letterblair, who lunched on a sandwich and tea, dined deliberately and deeply, and insisted on his guest's doing the same. Finally, when the closing rites had been accomplished, the cloth was removed, cigars were lit, and Mr. Letterblair, leaning back in his chair and pushing the port westward, said, spreading his back agreeably to the coal fire behind him: ""The whole family are against a divorce. And I think rightly."" Archer instantly felt himself on the other side of the argument. ""But why, sir? If there ever was a case--"" ""Well--what's the use? SHE'S here--he's there; the Atlantic's between them. She'll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he's voluntarily returned to her: their damned heathen marriage settlements take precious good care of that. As things go over there, Olenski's acted generously: he might have turned her out without a penny."" The young man knew this and was silent. ""I understand, though,"" Mr. Letterblair continued, ""that she attaches no importance to the money. Therefore, as the family say, why not let well enough alone?"" Archer had gone to the house an hour earlier in full agreement with Mr. Letterblair's view; but put into words by this selfish, well-fed and supremely indifferent old man it suddenly became the Pharisaic voice of a society wholly absorbed in barricading itself against the unpleasant. ""I think that's for her to decide."" ""H'm--have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce?"" ""You mean the threat in her husband's letter? What weight would that carry? It's no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard."" ""Yes; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the suit."" ""Unpleasant--!"" said Archer explosively. Mr. Letterblair looked at him from under enquiring eyebrows, and the young man, aware of the uselessness of trying to explain what was in his mind, bowed acquiescently while his senior continued: ""Divorce is always unpleasant."" ""You agree with me?"" Mr. Letterblair resumed, after a waiting silence. ""Naturally,"" said Archer. ""Well, then, I may count on you; the Mingotts may count on you; to use your influence against the idea?"" Archer hesitated. ""I can't pledge myself till I've seen the Countess Olenska,"" he said at length. ""Mr. Archer, I don't understand you. Do you want to marry into a family with a scandalous divorce-suit hanging over it?"" ""I don't think that has anything to do with the case."" Mr. Letterblair put down his glass of port and fixed on his young partner a cautious and apprehensive gaze. Archer understood that he ran the risk of having his mandate withdrawn, and for some obscure reason he disliked the prospect. Now that the job had been thrust on him he did not propose to relinquish it; and, to guard against the possibility, he saw that he must reassure the unimaginative old man who was the legal conscience of the Mingotts. ""You may be sure, sir, that I shan't commit myself till I've reported to you; what I meant was that I'd rather not give an opinion till I've heard what Madame Olenska has to say."" Mr. Letterblair nodded approvingly at an excess of caution worthy of the best New York tradition, and the young man, glancing at his watch, pleaded an engagement and took leave.  XII. Old-fashioned New York dined at seven, and the habit of after-dinner calls, though derided in Archer's set, still generally prevailed. As the young man strolled up Fifth Avenue from Waverley Place, the long thoroughfare was deserted but for a group of carriages standing before the Reggie Chiverses' (where there was a dinner for the Duke), and the occasional figure of an elderly gentleman in heavy overcoat and muffler ascending a brownstone doorstep and disappearing into a gas-lit hall. Thus, as Archer crossed Washington Square, he remarked that old Mr. du Lac was calling on his cousins the Dagonets, and turning down the corner of West Tenth Street he saw Mr. Skipworth, of his own firm, obviously bound on a visit to the Miss Lannings. A little farther up Fifth Avenue, Beaufort appeared on his doorstep, darkly projected against a blaze of light, descended to his private brougham, and rolled away to a mysterious and probably unmentionable destination. It was not an Opera night, and no one was giving a party, so that Beaufort's outing was undoubtedly of a clandestine nature. Archer connected it in his mind with a little house beyond Lexington Avenue in which beribboned window curtains and flower-boxes had recently appeared, and before whose newly painted door the canary-coloured brougham of Miss Fanny Ring was frequently seen to wait. Beyond the small and slippery pyramid which composed Mrs. Archer's world lay the almost unmapped quarter inhabited by artists, musicians and ""people who wrote."" These scattered fragments of humanity had never shown any desire to be amalgamated with the social structure. In spite of odd ways they were said to be, for the most part, quite respectable; but they preferred to keep to themselves. Medora Manson, in her prosperous days, had inaugurated a ""literary salon""; but it had soon died out owing to the reluctance of the literary to frequent it. Others had made the same attempt, and there was a household of Blenkers--an intense and voluble mother, and three blowsy daughters who imitated her--where one met Edwin Booth and Patti and William Winter, and the new Shakespearian actor George Rignold, and some of the magazine editors and musical and literary critics. Mrs. Archer and her group felt a certain timidity concerning these persons. They were odd, they were uncertain, they had things one didn't know about in the background of their lives and minds. Literature and art were deeply respected in the Archer set, and Mrs. Archer was always at pains to tell her children how much more agreeable and cultivated society had been when it included such figures as Washington Irving, Fitz-Greene Halleck and the poet of ""The Culprit Fay."" The most celebrated authors of that generation had been ""gentlemen""; perhaps the unknown persons who succeeded them had gentlemanly sentiments, but their origin, their appearance, their hair, their intimacy with the stage and the Opera, made any old New York criterion inapplicable to them. ""When I was a girl,"" Mrs. Archer used to say, ""we knew everybody between the Battery and Canal Street; and only the people one knew had carriages. It was perfectly easy to place any one then; now one can't tell, and I prefer not to try."" Only old Catherine Mingott, with her absence of moral prejudices and almost parvenu indifference to the subtler distinctions, might have bridged the abyss; but she had never opened a book or looked at a picture, and cared for music only because it reminded her of gala nights at the Italiens, in the days of her triumph at the Tuileries. Possibly Beaufort, who was her match in daring, would have succeeded in bringing about a fusion; but his grand house and silk-stockinged footmen were an obstacle to informal sociability. Moreover, he was as illiterate as old Mrs. Mingott, and considered ""fellows who wrote"" as the mere paid purveyors of rich men's pleasures; and no one rich enough to influence his opinion had ever questioned it. Newland Archer had been aware of these things ever since he could remember, and had accepted them as part of the structure of his universe. He knew that there were societies where painters and poets and novelists and men of science, and even great actors, were as sought after as Dukes; he had often pictured to himself what it would have been to live in the intimacy of drawing-rooms dominated by the talk of Merimee (whose ""Lettres a une Inconnue"" was one of his inseparables), of Thackeray, Browning or William Morris. But such things were inconceivable in New York, and unsettling to think of. Archer knew most of the ""fellows who wrote,"" the musicians and the painters: he met them at the Century, or at the little musical and theatrical clubs that were beginning to come into existence. He enjoyed them there, and was bored with them at the Blenkers', where they were mingled with fervid and dowdy women who passed them about like captured curiosities; and even after his most exciting talks with Ned Winsett he always came away with the feeling that if his world was small, so was theirs, and that the only way to enlarge either was to reach a stage of manners where they would naturally merge. He was reminded of this by trying to picture the society in which the Countess Olenska had lived and suffered, and also--perhaps--tasted mysterious joys. He remembered with what amusement she had told him that her grandmother Mingott and the Wellands objected to her living in a ""Bohemian"" quarter given over to ""people who wrote."" It was not the peril but the poverty that her family disliked; but that shade escaped her, and she supposed they considered literature compromising. She herself had no fears of it, and the books scattered about her drawing-room (a part of the house in which books were usually supposed to be ""out of place""), though chiefly works of fiction, had whetted Archer's interest with such new names as those of Paul Bourget, Huysmans, and the Goncourt brothers. Ruminating on these things as he approached her door, he was once more conscious of the curious way in which she reversed his values, and of the need of thinking himself into conditions incredibly different from any that he knew if he were to be of use in her present difficulty.  Nastasia opened the door, smiling mysteriously. On the bench in the hall lay a sable-lined overcoat, a folded opera hat of dull silk with a gold J. B. on the lining, and a white silk muffler: there was no mistaking the fact that these costly articles were the property of Julius Beaufort. Archer was angry: so angry that he came near scribbling a word on his card and going away; then he remembered that in writing to Madame Olenska he had been kept by excess of discretion from saying that he wished to see her privately. He had therefore no one but himself to blame if she had opened her doors to other visitors; and he entered the drawing-room with the dogged determination to make Beaufort feel himself in the way, and to outstay him. The banker stood leaning against the mantelshelf, which was draped with an old embroidery held in place by brass candelabra containing church candies of yellowish wax. He had thrust his chest out, supporting his shoulders against the mantel and resting his weight on one large patent-leather foot. As Archer entered he was smiling and looking down on his hostess, who sat on a sofa placed at right angles to the chimney. A table banked with flowers formed a screen behind it, and against the orchids and azaleas which the young man recognised as tributes from the Beaufort hot-houses, Madame Olenska sat half-reclined, her head propped on a hand and her wide sleeve leaving the arm bare to the elbow. It was usual for ladies who received in the evenings to wear what were called ""simple dinner dresses"": a close-fitting armour of whale-boned silk, slightly open in the neck, with lace ruffles filling in the crack, and tight sleeves with a flounce uncovering just enough wrist to show an Etruscan gold bracelet or a velvet band. But Madame Olenska, heedless of tradition, was attired in a long robe of red velvet bordered about the chin and down the front with glossy black fur. Archer remembered, on his last visit to Paris, seeing a portrait by the new painter, Carolus Duran, whose pictures were the sensation of the Salon, in which the lady wore one of these bold sheath-like robes with her chin nestling in fur. There was something perverse and provocative in the notion of fur worn in the evening in a heated drawing-room, and in the combination of a muffled throat and bare arms; but the effect was undeniably pleasing. ""Lord love us--three whole days at Skuytercliff!"" Beaufort was saying in his loud sneering voice as Archer entered. ""You'd better take all your furs, and a hot-water-bottle."" ""Why? Is the house so cold?"" she asked, holding out her left hand to Archer in a way mysteriously suggesting that she expected him to kiss it. ""No; but the missus is,"" said Beaufort, nodding carelessly to the young man. ""But I thought her so kind. She came herself to invite me. Granny says I must certainly go."" ""Granny would, of course. And I say it's a shame you're going to miss the little oyster supper I'd planned for you at Delmonico's next Sunday, with Campanini and Scalchi and a lot of jolly people."" She looked doubtfully from the banker to Archer. ""Ah--that does tempt me! Except the other evening at Mrs. Struthers's I've not met a single artist since I've been here."" ""What kind of artists? I know one or two painters, very good fellows, that I could bring to see you if you'd allow me,"" said Archer boldly. ""Painters? Are there painters in New York?"" asked Beaufort, in a tone implying that there could be none since he did not buy their pictures; and Madame Olenska said to Archer, with her grave smile: ""That would be charming. But I was really thinking of dramatic artists, singers, actors, musicians. My husband's house was always full of them."" She said the words ""my husband"" as if no sinister associations were connected with them, and in a tone that seemed almost to sigh over the lost delights of her married life. Archer looked at her perplexedly, wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that enabled her to touch so easily on the past at the very moment when she was risking her reputation in order to break with it. ""I do think,"" she went on, addressing both men, that the imprevu adds to one's enjoyment. It's perhaps a mistake to see the same people every day."" ""It's confoundedly dull, anyhow; New York is dying of dullness,"" Beaufort grumbled. ""And when I try to liven it up for you, you go back on me. Come--think better of it! Sunday is your last chance, for Campanini leaves next week for Baltimore and Philadelphia; and I've a private room, and a Steinway, and they'll sing all night for me."" ""How delicious! May I think it over, and write to you tomorrow morning?"" She spoke amiably, yet with the least hint of dismissal in her voice. Beaufort evidently felt it, and being Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton unused to dismissals, stood staring at her with an obstinate line between his eyes. ""Why not now?"" ""It's too serious a question to decide at this late hour."" ""Do you call it late?"" She returned his glance coolly. ""Yes; because I have still to talk business with Mr. Archer for a little while."" ""Ah,"" Beaufort snapped. There was no appeal from her tone, and with a slight shrug he recovered his composure, took her hand, which he kissed with a practised air, and calling out from the threshold: ""I say, Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town of course you're included in the supper,"" left the room with his heavy important step. For a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair must have told her of his coming; but the irrelevance of her next remark made him change his mind. ""You know painters, then? You live in their milieu?"" she asked, her eyes full of interest. ""Oh, not exactly. I don't know that the arts have a milieu here, any of them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt."" ""But you care for such things?"" ""Immensely. When I'm in Paris or London I never miss an exhibition. I try to keep up."" She looked down at the tip of the little satin boot that peeped from her long draperies. ""I used to care immensely too: my life was full of such things. But now I want to try not to."" ""You want to try not to?"" ""Yes: I want to cast off all my old life, to become just like everybody else here."" Archer reddened. ""You'll never be like everybody else,"" he said. She raised her straight eyebrows a little. ""Ah, don't say that. If you knew how I hate to be different!"" Her face had grown as sombre as a tragic mask. She leaned forward, clasping her knee in her thin hands, and looking away from him into remote dark distances. ""I want to get away from it all,"" she insisted. He waited a moment and cleared his throat. ""I know. Mr. Letterblair has told me."" ""Ah?"" ""That's the reason I've come. He asked me to--you see I'm in the firm."" She looked slightly surprised, and then her eyes brightened. ""You mean you can manage it for me? I can talk to you instead of Mr. Letterblair? Oh, that will be so much easier!"" Her tone touched him, and his confidence grew with his self-satisfaction. He perceived that she had spoken of business to Beaufort simply to get rid of him; and to have routed Beaufort was something of a triumph. ""I am here to talk about it,"" he repeated. She sat silent, her head still propped by the arm that rested on the back of the sofa. Her face looked pale and extinguished, as if dimmed by the rich red of her dress. She struck Archer, of a sudden, as a pathetic and even pitiful figure. ""Now we're coming to hard facts,"" he thought, conscious in himself of the same instinctive recoil that he had so often criticised in his mother and her contemporaries. How little practice he had had in dealing with unusual situations! Their very vocabulary was unfamiliar to him, and seemed to belong to fiction and the stage. In face of what was coming he felt as awkward and embarrassed as a boy. After a pause Madame Olenska broke out with unexpected vehemence: ""I want to be free; I want to wipe out all the past."" ""I understand that."" Her face warmed. ""Then you'll help me?"" ""First--"" he hesitated--""perhaps I ought to know a little more."" She seemed surprised. ""You know about my husband-- my life with him?"" He made a sign of assent. ""Well--then--what more is there? In this country are such things tolerated? I'm a Protestant--our church does not forbid divorce in such cases."" ""Certainly not."" They were both silent again, and Archer felt the spectre of Count Olenski's letter grimacing hideously between them. The letter filled only half a page, and was just what he had described it to be in speaking of it to Mr. Letterblair: the vague charge of an angry blackguard. But how much truth was behind it? Only Count Olenski's wife could tell. ""I've looked through the papers you gave to Mr. Letterblair,"" he said at length. ""Well--can there be anything more abominable?"" ""No."" She changed her position slightly, screening her eyes with her lifted hand. ""Of course you know,"" Archer continued, ""that if your husband chooses to fight the case--as he threatens to--"" ""Yes--?"" ""He can say things--things that might be unpl--might be disagreeable to you: say them publicly, so that they would get about, and harm you even if--"" ""If--?"" ""I mean: no matter how unfounded they were."" She paused for a long interval; so long that, not wishing to keep his eyes on her shaded face, he had time to imprint on his mind the exact shape of her other hand, the one on her knee, and every detail of the three rings on her fourth and fifth fingers; among which, he noticed, a wedding ring did not appear. ""What harm could such accusations, even if he made them publicly, do me here?"" It was on his lips to exclaim: ""My poor child--far more harm than anywhere else!"" Instead, he answered, in a voice that sounded in his ears like Mr. Letterblair's: ""New York society is a very small world compared with the one you've lived in. And it's ruled, in spite of appearances, by a few people with--well, rather old- fashioned ideas."" She said nothing, and he continued: ""Our ideas about marriage and divorce are particularly old-fashioned. Our legislation favours divorce--our social customs don't."" ""Never?"" ""Well--not if the woman, however injured, however irreproachable, has appearances in the least degree against her, has exposed herself by any unconventional action to--to offensive insinuations--"" She drooped her head a little lower, and he waited again, intensely hoping for a flash of indignation, or at least a brief cry of denial. None came. A little travelling clock ticked purringly at her elbow, and a log broke in two and sent up a shower of sparks. The whole hushed and brooding room seemed to be waiting silently with Archer. ""Yes,"" she murmured at length, ""that's what my family tell me."" He winced a little. ""It's not unnatural--"" ""OUR family,"" she corrected herself; and Archer coloured. ""For you'll be my cousin soon,"" she continued gently. ""I hope so."" ""And you take their view?"" He stood up at this, wandered across the room, stared with void eyes at one of the pictures against the old red damask, and came back irresolutely to her side. How could he say: ""Yes, if what your husband hints is true, or if you've no way of disproving it?"" ""Sincerely--"" she interjected, as he was about to speak. He looked down into the fire. ""Sincerely, then--what should you gain that would compensate for the possibility-- the certainty--of a lot of beastly talk?"" ""But my freedom--is that nothing?"" It flashed across him at that instant that the charge in the letter was true, and that she hoped to marry the partner of her guilt. How was he to tell her that, if she really cherished such a plan, the laws of the State were inexorably opposed to it? The mere suspicion that the thought was in her mind made him feel harshly and impatiently toward her. ""But aren't you as free as air as it is?"" he returned. ""Who can touch you? Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled--"" ""Oh, yes,"" she said indifferently. ""Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful? Think of the newspapers--their vileness! It's all stupid and narrow and unjust--but one can't make over society."" ""No,"" she acquiesced; and her tone was so faint and desolate that he felt a sudden remorse for his own hard thoughts. ""The individual, in such cases, is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest: people cling to any convention that keeps the family together--protects the children, if there are any,"" he rambled on, pouring out all the stock phrases that rose to his lips in his intense desire to cover over the ugly reality which her silence seemed to have laid bare. Since she would not or could not say the one word that would have cleared the air, his wish was not to let her feel that he was trying to probe into her secret. Better keep on the surface, in the prudent old New York way, than risk uncovering a wound he could not heal. ""It's my business, you know,"" he went on, ""to help you to see these things as the people who are fondest of you see them. The Mingotts, the Wellands, the van der Luydens, all your friends and relations: if I didn't show you honestly how they judge such questions, it wouldn't be fair of me, would it?"" He spoke insistently, almost pleading with her in his eagerness to cover up that yawning silence. She said slowly: ""No; it wouldn't be fair."" The fire had crumbled down to greyness, and one of the lamps made a gurgling appeal for attention. Madame Olenska rose, wound it up and returned to the fire, but without resuming her seat. Her remaining on her feet seemed to signify that there was nothing more for either of them to say, and Archer stood up also. ""Very well; I will do what you wish,"" she said abruptly. The blood rushed to his forehead; and, taken aback by the suddenness of her surrender, he caught her two hands awkwardly in his. ""I--I do want to help you,"" he said. ""You do help me. Good night, my cousin."" He bent and laid his lips on her hands, which were cold and lifeless. She drew them away, and he turned to the door, found his coat and hat under the faint gas-light of the hall, and plunged out into the winter night bursting with the belated eloquence of the inarticulate. XIII. It was a crowded night at Wallack's theatre. The play was ""The Shaughraun,"" with Dion Boucicault in the title role and Harry Montague and Ada Dyas as the lovers. The popularity of the admirable English company was at its height, and the Shaughraun always packed the house. In the galleries the enthusiasm was unreserved; in the stalls and boxes, people smiled a little at the hackneyed sentiments and clap- trap situations, and enjoyed the play as much as the galleries did. There was one episode, in particular, that held the house from floor to ceiling. It was that in which Harry Montague, after a sad, almost monosyllabic scene of parting with Miss Dyas, bade her good-bye, and turned to go. The actress, who was standing near the mantelpiece and looking down into the fire, wore a gray cashmere dress without fashionable loopings or trimmings, moulded to her tall figure and flowing in long lines about her feet. Around her neck was a narrow black velvet ribbon with the ends falling down her back. When her wooer turned from her she rested her arms against the mantel-shelf and bowed her face in her hands. On the threshold he paused to look at her; then he stole back, lifted one of the ends of velvet ribbon, kissed it, and left the room without her hearing him or changing her attitude. And on this silent parting the curtain fell. It was always for the sake of that particular scene that Newland Archer went to see ""The Shaughraun."" He thought the adieux of Montague and Ada Dyas as fine as anything he had ever seen Croisette and Bressant do in Paris, or Madge Robertson and Kendal in London; in its reticence, its dumb sorrow, it moved him more than the most famous histrionic outpourings. On the evening in question the little scene acquired an added poignancy by reminding him--he could not have said why--of his leave-taking from Madame Olenska after their confidential talk a week or ten days earlier. It would have been as difficult to discover any resemblance between the two situations as between the appearance of the persons concerned. Newland Archer could not pretend to anything approaching the young English actor's romantic good looks, and Miss Dyas was a tall red-haired woman of monumental build whose pale and pleasantly ugly face was utterly unlike Ellen Olenska's vivid countenance. Nor were Archer and Madame Olenska two lovers parting in heart-broken silence; they were client and lawyer separating after a talk which had given the lawyer the worst possible impression of the client's case. Wherein, then, lay the resemblance that made the young man's heart beat with a kind of retrospective excitement? It seemed to be in Madame Olenska's mysterious faculty of suggesting tragic and moving possibilities outside the daily run of experience. She had hardly ever said a word to him to produce this impression, but it was a part of her, either a projection of her mysterious and outlandish background or of something inherently dramatic, passionate and unusual in herself. Archer had always been inclined to think that chance and circumstance played a small part in shaping people's lots compared with their innate tendency to have things happen to them. This tendency he had felt from the first in Madame Olenska. The quiet, almost passive young woman struck him as exactly the kind of person to whom things were bound to happen, no matter how much she shrank from them and went out of her way to avoid them. The exciting fact was her having lived in an atmosphere so thick with drama that her own tendency to provoke it had apparently passed unperceived. It was precisely the odd absence of surprise in her that gave him the sense of her having been plucked out of a very maelstrom: the things she took for granted gave the measure of those she had rebelled against. Archer had left her with the conviction that Count Olenski's accusation was not unfounded. The mysterious person who figured in his wife's past as ""the secretary"" had probably not been unrewarded for his share in her escape. The conditions from which she had fled were intolerable, past speaking of, past believing: she was young, she was frightened, she was desperate-- what more natural than that she should be grateful to her rescuer? The pity was that her gratitude put her, in the law's eyes and the world's, on a par with her abominable husband. Archer had made her understand this, as he was bound to do; he had also made her understand that simplehearted kindly New York, on whose larger charity she had apparently counted, was precisely the place where she could least hope for indulgence. To have to make this fact plain to her--and to witness her resigned acceptance of it--had been intolerably painful to him. He felt himself drawn to her by obscure feelings of jealousy and pity, as if her dumbly- confessed error had put her at his mercy, humbling yet endearing her. He was glad it was to him she had revealed her secret, rather than to the cold scrutiny of Mr. Letterblair, or the embarrassed gaze of her family. He immediately took it upon himself to assure them both that she had given up her idea of seeking a divorce, basing her decision on the fact that she had understood the uselessness of the proceeding; and with infinite relief they had all turned their eyes from the ""unpleasantness"" she had spared them. ""I was sure Newland would manage it,"" Mrs. Welland had said proudly of her future son-in-law; and old Mrs. Mingott, who had summoned him for a confidential interview, had congratulated him on his cleverness, and added impatiently: ""Silly goose! I told her myself what nonsense it was. Wanting to pass herself off as Ellen Mingott and an old maid, when she has the luck to be a married woman and a Countess!"" These incidents had made the memory of his last talk with Madame Olenska so vivid to the young man that as the curtain fell on the parting of the two actors his eyes filled with tears, and he stood up to leave the theatre. In doing so, he turned to the side of the house behind him, and saw the lady of whom he was thinking seated in a box with the Beauforts, Lawrence Lefferts and one or two other men. He had not spoken with her alone since their evening together, and had tried to avoid being with her in company; but now their eyes met, and as Mrs. Beaufort recognised him at the same time, and made her languid little gesture of invitation, it was impossible not to go into the box. Beaufort and Lefferts made way for him, and after a few words with Mrs. Beaufort, who always preferred to look beautiful and not have to talk, Archer seated himself behind Madame Olenska. There was no one else in the box but Mr. Sillerton Jackson, who was telling Mrs. Beaufort in a confidential undertone about Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's last Sunday reception (where some people reported that there had been dancing). Under cover of this circumstantial narrative, to which Mrs. Beaufort listened with her perfect smile, and her head at just the right angle to be seen in profile from the stalls, Madame Olenska turned and spoke in a low voice. ""Do you think,"" she asked, glancing toward the stage, ""he will send her a bunch of yellow roses tomorrow morning?"" Archer reddened, and his heart gave a leap of surprise. He had called only twice on Madame Olenska, and each time he had sent her a box of yellow roses, and each time without a card. She had never before made any allusion to the flowers, and he supposed she had never thought of him as the sender. Now her sudden recognition of the gift, and her associating it with the tender leave-taking on the stage, filled him with an agitated pleasure. ""I was thinking of that too--I was going to leave the theatre in order to take the picture away with me,"" he said. To his surprise her colour rose, reluctantly and duskily. She looked down at the mother-of-pearl opera-glass in her smoothly gloved hands, and said, after a pause: ""What do you do while May is away?"" ""I stick to my work,"" he answered, faintly annoyed by the question. In obedience to a long-established habit, the Wellands had left the previous week for St. Augustine, where, out of regard for the supposed susceptibility of Mr. Welland's bronchial tubes, they always spent the latter part of the winter. Mr. Welland was a mild and silent man, with no opinions but with many habits. With these habits none might interfere; and one of them demanded that his wife and daughter should always go with him on his annual journey to the south. To preserve an unbroken domesticity was essential to his peace of mind; he would not have known where his hair-brushes were, or how to provide stamps for his letters, if Mrs. Welland had not been there to tell him. As all the members of the family adored each other, and as Mr. Welland was the central object of their idolatry, it never occurred to his wife and May to let him go to St. Augustine alone; and his sons, who were both in the law, and could not leave New York during the winter, always joined him for Easter and travelled back with him. It was impossible for Archer to discuss the necessity of May's accompanying her father. The reputation of the Mingotts' family physician was largely based on the attack of pneumonia which Mr. Welland had never had; and his insistence on St. Augustine was therefore inflexible. Originally, it had been intended that May's engagement should not be announced till her return from Florida, and the fact that it had been made known sooner could not be expected to alter Mr. Welland's plans. Archer would have liked to join the travellers and have a few weeks of sunshine and boating with his betrothed; but he too was bound by custom and conventions. Little arduous as his professional duties were, he would have been convicted of frivolity by the whole Mingott clan if he had suggested asking for a holiday in mid-winter; and he accepted May's departure with the resignation which he perceived would have to be one of the principal constituents of married life. He was conscious that Madame Olenska was looking at him under lowered lids. ""I have done what you wished--what you advised,"" she said abruptly. ""Ah--I'm glad,"" he returned, embarrassed by her broaching the subject at such a moment. ""I understand--that you were right,"" she went on a little breathlessly; ""but sometimes life is difficult . . . perplexing. . ."" ""I know."" ""And I wanted to tell you that I DO feel you were right; and that I'm grateful to you,"" she ended, lifting her opera-glass quickly to her eyes as the door of the box opened and Beaufort's resonant voice broke in on them. Archer stood up, and left the box and the theatre. Only the day before he had received a letter from May Welland in which, with characteristic candour, she had asked him to ""be kind to Ellen"" in their absence. ""She likes you and admires you so much--and you know, though she doesn't show it, she's still very lonely and unhappy. I don't think Granny understands her, or uncle Lovell Mingott either; they really think she's much worldlier and fonder of society than she is. And I can quite see that New York must seem dull to her, though the family won't admit it. I think she's been used to lots of things we haven't got; wonderful music, and picture shows, and celebrities--artists and authors and all the clever people you admire. Granny can't understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and clothes--but I can see that you're almost the only person in New York who can talk to her about what she really cares for."" His wise May--how he had loved her for that letter! But he had not meant to act on it; he was too busy, to begin with, and he did not care, as an engaged man, to play too conspicuously the part of Madame Olenska's champion. He had an idea that she knew how to take care of herself a good deal better than the ingenuous May imagined. She had Beaufort at her feet, Mr. van der Luyden hovering above her like a protecting deity, and any number of candidates (Lawrence Lefferts among them) waiting their opportunity in the middle distance. Yet he never saw her, or exchanged a word with her, without feeling that, after all, May's ingenuousness almost amounted to a gift of divination. Ellen Olenska was lonely and she was unhappy.  XIV. As he came out into the lobby Archer ran across his friend Ned Winsett, the only one among what Janey called his ""clever people"" with whom he cared to probe into things a little deeper than the average level of club and chop-house banter. He had caught sight, across the house, of Winsett's shabby round-shouldered back, and had once noticed his eyes turned toward the Beaufort box. The two men shook hands, and Winsett proposed a bock at a little German restaurant around the corner. Archer, who was not in the mood for the kind of talk they were likely to get there, declined on the plea that he had work to do at home; and Winsett said: ""Oh, well so have I for that matter, and I'll be the Industrious Apprentice too."" They strolled along together, and presently Winsett said: ""Look here, what I'm really after is the name of the dark lady in that swell box of yours--with the Beauforts, wasn't she? The one your friend Lefferts seems so smitten by."" Archer, he could not have said why, was slightly annoyed. What the devil did Ned Winsett want with Ellen Olenska's name? And above all, why did he couple it with Lefferts's? It was unlike Winsett to manifest such curiosity; but after all, Archer remembered, he was a journalist. ""It's not for an interview, I hope?"" he laughed. ""Well--not for the press; just for myself,"" Winsett rejoined. ""The fact is she's a neighbour of mine--queer quarter for such a beauty to settle in--and she's been awfully kind to my little boy, who fell down her area chasing his kitten, and gave himself a nasty cut. She rushed in bareheaded, carrying him in her arms, with his knee all beautifully bandaged, and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too dazzled to ask her name."" A pleasant glow dilated Archer's heart. There was nothing extraordinary in the tale: any woman would have done as much for a neighbour's child. But it was just like Ellen, he felt, to have rushed in bareheaded, carrying the boy in her arms, and to have dazzled poor Mrs. Winsett into forgetting to ask who she was. ""That is the Countess Olenska--a granddaughter of old Mrs. Mingott's."" ""Whew--a Countess!"" whistled Ned Winsett. ""Well, I didn't know Countesses were so neighbourly. Mingotts ain't."" ""They would be, if you'd let them."" ""Ah, well--"" It was their old interminable argument as to the obstinate unwillingness of the ""clever people"" to frequent the fashionable, and both men knew that there was no use in prolonging it. ""I wonder,"" Winsett broke off, ""how a Countess happens to live in our slum?"" ""Because she doesn't care a hang about where she lives--or about any of our little social sign-posts,"" said Archer, with a secret pride in his own picture of her. ""H'm--been in bigger places, I suppose,"" the other commented. ""Well, here's my corner."" He slouched off across Broadway, and Archer stood looking after him and musing on his last words. Ned Winsett had those flashes of penetration; they were the most interesting thing about him, and always made Archer wonder why they had allowed him to accept failure so stolidly at an age when most men are still struggling. Archer had known that Winsett had a wife and child, but he had never seen them. The two men always met at the Century, or at some haunt of journalists and theatrical people, such as the restaurant where Winsett had proposed to go for a bock. He had given Archer to understand that his wife was an invalid; which might be true of the poor lady, or might merely mean that she was lacking in social gifts or in evening clothes, or in both. Winsett himself had a savage abhorrence of social observances: Archer, who dressed in the evening because he thought it cleaner and more comfortable to do so, and who had never stopped to consider that cleanliness and comfort are two of the costliest items in a modest budget, regarded Winsett's attitude as part of the boring ""Bohemian"" pose that always made fashionable people, who changed their clothes without talking about it, and were not forever harping on the number of servants one kept, seem so much simpler and less self-conscious than the others. Nevertheless, he was always stimulated by Winsett, and whenever he caught sight of the journalist's lean bearded face and melancholy eyes he would rout him out of his corner and carry him off for a long talk. Winsett was not a journalist by choice. He was a pure man of letters, untimely born in a world that had no need of letters; but after publishing one volume of brief and exquisite literary appreciations, of which one hundred and twenty copies were sold, thirty given away, and the balance eventually destroyed by the publishers (as per contract) to make room for more marketable material, he had abandoned his real calling, and taken a sub-editorial job on a women's weekly, where fashion- plates and paper patterns alternated with New England love-stories and advertisements of temperance drinks. On the subject of ""Hearth-fires"" (as the paper was called) he was inexhaustibly entertaining; but beneath his fun lurked the sterile bitterness of the still young man who has tried and given up. His conversation always made Archer take the measure of his own life, and feel how little it contained; but Winsett's, after all, contained still less, and though their common fund of intellectual interests and curiosities made their talks exhilarating, their exchange of views usually remained within the limits of a pensive dilettantism. ""The fact is, life isn't much a fit for either of us,"" Winsett had once said. ""I'm down and out; nothing to be done about it. I've got only one ware to produce, and there's no market for it here, and won't be in my time. But you're free and you're well-off. Why don't you get into touch? There's only one way to do it: to go into politics."" Archer threw his head back and laughed. There one saw at a flash the unbridgeable difference between men like Winsett and the others--Archer's kind. Every one in polite circles knew that, in America, ""a gentleman couldn't go into politics."" But, since he could hardly put it in that way to Winsett, he answered evasively: ""Look at the career of the honest man in American politics! They don't want us."" ""Who's `they'? Why don't you all get together and be `they' yourselves?"" Archer's laugh lingered on his lips in a slightly condescending smile. It was useless to prolong the discussion: everybody knew the melancholy fate of the few gentlemen who had risked their clean linen in municipal or state politics in New York. The day was past when that sort of thing was possible: the country was in possession of the bosses and the emigrant, and decent people had to fall back on sport or culture. ""Culture! Yes--if we had it! But there are just a few little local patches, dying out here and there for lack of--well, hoeing and cross-fertilising: the last remnants of the old European tradition that your forebears brought with them. But you're in a pitiful little minority: you've got no centre, no competition, no audience. You're like the pictures on the walls of a deserted house: `The Portrait of a Gentleman.' You'll never amount to anything, any of you, till you roll up your sleeves and get right down into the muck. That, or emigrate . . . God! If I could emigrate . . ."" Archer mentally shrugged his shoulders and turned the conversation back to books, where Winsett, if uncertain, was always interesting. Emigrate! As if a gentleman could abandon his own country! One could no more do that than one could roll up one's sleeves and go down into the muck. A gentleman simply stayed at home and abstained. But you couldn't make a man like Winsett see that; and that was why the New York of literary clubs and exotic restaurants, though a first shake made it seem more of a kaleidoscope, turned out, in the end, to be a smaller box, with a more monotonous pattern, than the assembled atoms of Fifth Avenue.  The next morning Archer scoured the town in vain for more yellow roses. In consequence of this search he arrived late at the office, perceived that his doing so made no difference whatever to any one, and was filled with sudden exasperation at the elaborate futility of his life. Why should he not be, at that moment, on the sands of St. Augustine with May Welland? No one was deceived by his pretense of professional activity. In old-fashioned legal firms like that of which Mr. Letterblair was the head, and which were mainly engaged in the management of large estates and ""conservative"" investments, there were always two or three young men, fairly well-off, and without professional ambition, who, for a certain number of hours of each day, sat at their desks accomplishing trivial tasks, or simply reading the newspapers. Though it was supposed to be proper for them to have an occupation, the crude fact of money-making was still regarded as derogatory, and the law, being a profession, was accounted a more gentlemanly pursuit than business. But none of these young men had much hope of really advancing in his profession, or any earnest desire to do so; and over many of them the green mould of the perfunctory was already perceptibly spreading. It made Archer shiver to think that it might be spreading over him too. He had, to be sure, other tastes and interests; he spent his vacations in European travel, cultivated the ""clever people"" May spoke of, and generally tried to ""keep up,"" as he had somewhat wistfully put it to Madame Olenska. But once he was married, what would become of this narrow margin of life in which his real experiences were lived? He had seen enough of other young men who had dreamed his dream, though perhaps less ardently, and who had gradually sunk into the placid and luxurious routine of their elders. From the office he sent a note by messenger to Madame Olenska, asking if he might call that afternoon, and begging her to let him find a reply at his club; but at the club he found nothing, nor did he receive any letter the following day. This unexpected silence mortified him beyond reason, and though the next morning he saw a glorious cluster of yellow roses behind a florist's window-pane, he left it there. It was only on the third morning that he received a line by post from the Countess Olenska. To his surprise it was dated from Skuytercliff, whither the van der Luydens had promptly retreated after putting the Duke on board his steamer. ""I ran away,"" the writer began abruptly (without the usual preliminaries), ""the day after I saw you at the play, and these kind friends have taken me in. I wanted to be quiet, and think things over. You were right in telling me how kind they were; I feel myself so safe here. I wish that you were with us."" She ended with a conventional ""Yours sincerely,"" and without any allusion to the date of her return. The tone of the note surprised the young man. What was Madame Olenska running away from, and why did she feel the need to be safe? His first thought was of some dark menace from abroad; then he reflected that he did not know her epistolary style, and that it might run to picturesque exaggeration. Women always exaggerated; and moreover she was not wholly at her ease in English, which she often spoke as if she were translating from the French. ""Je me suis evadee--"" put in that way, the opening sentence immediately suggested that she might merely have wanted to escape from a boring round of engagements; which was very likely true, for he judged her to be capricious, and easily wearied of the pleasure of the moment. It amused him to think of the van der Luydens' having carried her off to Skuytercliff on a second visit, and this time for an indefinite period. The doors of Skuytercliff were rarely and grudgingly opened to visitors, and a chilly week-end was the most ever offered to the few thus privileged. But Archer had seen, on his last visit to Paris, the delicious play of Labiche, ""Le Voyage de M. Perrichon,"" and he remembered M. Perrichon's dogged and undiscouraged attachment to the young man whom he had pulled out of the glacier. The van der Luydens had rescued Madame Olenska from a doom almost as icy; and though there were many other reasons for being attracted to her, Archer knew that beneath them all lay the gentle and obstinate determination to go on rescuing her. He felt a distinct disappointment on learning that she was away; and almost immediately remembered that, only the day before, he had refused an invitation to spend the following Sunday with the Reggie Chiverses at their house on the Hudson, a few miles below Skuytercliff. He had had his fill long ago of the noisy friendly parties at Highbank, with coasting, ice-boating, sleighing, long tramps in the snow, and a general flavour of mild flirting and milder practical jokes. He had just received a box of new books from his London book- seller, and had preferred the prospect of a quiet Sunday at home with his spoils. But he now went into the club writing-room, wrote a hurried telegram, and told the servant to send it immediately. He knew that Mrs. Reggie didn't object to her visitors' suddenly changing their minds, and that there was always a room to spare in her elastic house.  XV. Newland Archer arrived at the Chiverses' on Friday evening, and on Saturday went conscientiously through all the rites appertaining to a week-end at Highbank. In the morning he had a spin in the ice-boat with his hostess and a few of the hardier guests; in the afternoon he ""went over the farm"" with Reggie, and listened, in the elaborately appointed stables, to long and impressive disquisitions on the horse; after tea he talked in a corner of the firelit hall with a young lady who had professed herself broken-hearted when his engagement was announced, but was now eager to tell him of her own matrimonial hopes; and finally, about midnight, he assisted in putting a gold-fish in one visitor's bed, dressed up a burglar in the bath-room of a nervous aunt, and saw in the small hours by joining in a pillow-fight that ranged from the nurseries to the basement. But on Sunday after luncheon he borrowed a cutter, and drove over to Skuytercliff. People had always been told that the house at Skuytercliff was an Italian villa. Those who had never been to Italy believed it; so did some who had. The house had been built by Mr. van der Luyden in his youth, on his return from the ""grand tour,"" and in anticipation of his approaching marriage with Miss Louisa Dagonet. It was a large square wooden structure, with tongued and grooved walls painted pale green and white, a Corinthian portico, and fluted pilasters between the windows. From the high ground on which it stood a series of terraces bordered by balustrades and urns descended in the steel-engraving style to a small irregular lake with an asphalt edge overhung by rare weeping conifers. To the right and left, the famous weedless lawns studded with ""specimen"" trees (each of a different variety) rolled away to long ranges of grass crested with elaborate cast-iron ornaments; and below, in a hollow, lay the four-roomed stone house which the first Patroon had built on the land granted him in 1612. Against the uniform sheet of snow and the greyish winter sky the Italian villa loomed up rather grimly; even in summer it kept its distance, and the boldest coleus bed had never ventured nearer than thirty feet from its awful front. Now, as Archer rang the bell, the long tinkle seemed to echo through a mausoleum; and the surprise of the butler who at length responded to the call was as great as though he had been summoned from his final sleep. Happily Archer was of the family, and therefore, irregular though his arrival was, entitled to be informed that the Countess Olenska was out, having driven to afternoon service with Mrs. van der Luyden exactly three quarters of an hour earlier. ""Mr. van der Luyden,"" the butler continued, ""is in, sir; but my impression is that he is either finishing his nap or else reading yesterday's Evening Post. I heard him say, sir, on his return from church this morning, that he intended to look through the Evening Post after luncheon; if you like, sir, I might go to the library door and listen--"" But Archer, thanking him, said that he would go and meet the ladies; and the butler, obviously relieved, closed the door on him majestically. A groom took the cutter to the stables, and Archer struck through the park to the high-road. The village of Skuytercliff was only a mile and a half away, but he knew that Mrs. van der Luyden never walked, and that he must keep to the road to meet the carriage. Presently, however, coming down a foot-path that crossed the highway, he caught sight of a slight figure in a red cloak, with a big dog running ahead. He hurried forward, and Madame Olenska stopped short with a smile of welcome. ""Ah, you've come!"" she said, and drew her hand from her muff. The red cloak made her look gay and vivid, like the Ellen Mingott of old days; and he laughed as he took her hand, and answered: ""I came to see what you were running away from."" Her face clouded over, but she answered: ""Ah, well-- you will see, presently."" The answer puzzled him. ""Why--do you mean that you've been overtaken?"" She shrugged her shoulders, with a little movement like Nastasia's, and rejoined in a lighter tone: ""Shall we walk on? I'm so cold after the sermon. And what does it matter, now you're here to protect me?"" The blood rose to his temples and he caught a fold of her cloak. ""Ellen--what is it? You must tell me."" ""Oh, presently--let's run a race first: my feet are freezing to the ground,"" she cried; and gathering up the cloak she fled away across the snow, the dog leaping about her with challenging barks. For a moment Archer stood watching, his gaze delighted by the flash of the red meteor against the snow; then he started after her, and they met, panting and laughing, at a wicket that led into the park. She looked up at him and smiled. ""I knew you'd come!"" ""That shows you wanted me to,"" he returned, with a disproportionate joy in their nonsense. The white glitter of the trees filled the air with its own mysterious brightness, and as they walked on over the snow the ground seemed to sing under their feet. ""Where did you come from?"" Madame Olenska asked. He told her, and added: ""It was because I got your note."" After a pause she said, with a just perceptible chill in her voice: ""May asked you to take care of me."" ""I didn't need any asking."" ""You mean--I'm so evidently helpless and defenceless? What a poor thing you must all think me! But women here seem not--seem never to feel the need: any more than the blessed in heaven."" He lowered his voice to ask: ""What sort of a need?"" ""Ah, don't ask me! I don't speak your language,"" she retorted petulantly. The answer smote him like a blow, and he stood still in the path, looking down at her. ""What did I come for, if I don't speak yours?"" ""Oh, my friend--!"" She laid her hand lightly on his arm, and he pleaded earnestly: ""Ellen--why won't you tell me what's happened?"" She shrugged again. ""Does anything ever happen in heaven?"" He was silent, and they walked on a few yards without exchanging a word. Finally she said: ""I will tell you--but where, where, where? One can't be alone for a minute in that great seminary of a house, with all the doors wide open, and always a servant bringing tea, or a log for the fire, or the newspaper! Is there nowhere in an American house where one may be by one's self? You're so shy, and yet you're so public. I always feel as if I were in the convent again--or on the stage, before a dreadfully polite audience that never applauds."" ""Ah, you don't like us!"" Archer exclaimed. They were walking past the house of the old Patroon, with its squat walls and small square windows compactly grouped about a central chimney. The shutters stood wide, and through one of the newly-washed windows Archer caught the light of a fire. ""Why--the house is open!"" he said. She stood still. ""No; only for today, at least. I wanted to see it, and Mr. van der Luyden had the fire lit and the windows opened, so that we might stop there on the way back from church this morning."" She ran up the steps and tried the door. ""It's still unlocked--what luck! Come in and we can have a quiet talk. Mrs. van der Luyden has driven over to see her old aunts at Rhinebeck and we shan't be missed at the house for another hour."" He followed her into the narrow passage. His spirits, which had dropped at her last words, rose with an irrational leap. The homely little house stood there, its panels and brasses shining in the firelight, as if magically created to receive them. A big bed of embers still gleamed in the kitchen chimney, under an iron pot hung from an ancient crane. Rush-bottomed arm-chairs faced each other across the tiled hearth, and rows of Delft plates stood on shelves against the walls. Archer stooped over and threw a log upon the embers. Madame Olenska, dropping her cloak, sat down in one of the chairs. Archer leaned against the chimney and looked at her. ""You're laughing now; but when you wrote me you were unhappy,"" he said. ""Yes."" She paused. ""But I can't feel unhappy when you're here."" ""I sha'n't be here long,"" he rejoined, his lips stiffening with the effort to say just so much and no more. ""No; I know. But I'm improvident: I live in the moment when I'm happy."" The words stole through him like a temptation, and to close his senses to it he moved away from the hearth and stood gazing out at the black tree-boles against the snow. But it was as if she too had shifted her place, and he still saw her, between himself and the trees, drooping over the fire with her indolent smile. Archer's heart was beating insubordinately. What if it were from him that she had been running away, and if she had waited to tell him so till they were here alone together in this secret room? ""Ellen, if I'm really a help to you--if you really wanted me to come--tell me what's wrong, tell me what it is you're running away from,"" he insisted. He spoke without shifting his position, without even turning to look at her: if the thing was to happen, it was to happen in this way, with the whole width of the room between them, and his eyes still fixed on the outer snow. For a long moment she was silent; and in that moment Archer imagined her, almost heard her, stealing up behind him to throw her light arms about his neck. While he waited, soul and body throbbing with the miracle to come, his eyes mechanically received the image of a heavily-coated man with his fur collar turned up who was advancing along the path to the house. The man was Julius Beaufort. ""Ah--!"" Archer cried, bursting into a laugh. Madame Olenska had sprung up and moved to his side, slipping her hand into his; but after a glance through the window her face paled and she shrank back. ""So that was it?"" Archer said derisively. ""I didn't know he was here,"" Madame Olenska murmured. Her hand still clung to Archer's; but he drew away from her, and walking out into the passage threw open the door of the house. ""Hallo, Beaufort--this way! Madame Olenska was expecting you,"" he said.  During his journey back to New York the next morning, Archer relived with a fatiguing vividness his last moments at Skuytercliff. Beaufort, though clearly annoyed at finding him with Madame Olenska, had, as usual, carried off the situation high-handedly. His way of ignoring people whose presence inconvenienced him actually gave them, if they were sensitive to it, a feeling of invisibility, of nonexistence. Archer, as the three strolled back through the park, was aware of this odd sense of disembodiment; and humbling as it was to his vanity it gave him the ghostly advantage of observing unobserved. Beaufort had entered the little house with his usual easy assurance; but he could not smile away the vertical line between his eyes. It was fairly clear that Madame Olenska had not known that he was coming, though her words to Archer had hinted at the possibility; at any rate, she had evidently not told him where she was going when she left New York, and her unexplained departure had exasperated him. The ostensible reason of his appearance was the discovery, the very night before, of a ""perfect little house,"" not in the market, which was really just the thing for her, but would be snapped up instantly if she didn't take it; and he was loud in mock-reproaches for the dance she had led him in running away just as he had found it. ""If only this new dodge for talking along a wire had been a little bit nearer perfection I might have told you all this from town, and been toasting my toes before the club fire at this minute, instead of tramping after you through the snow,"" he grumbled, disguising a real irritation under the pretence of it; and at this opening Madame Olenska twisted the talk away to the fantastic possibility that they might one day actually converse with each other from street to street, or even-- incredible dream!--from one town to another. This struck from all three allusions to Edgar Poe and Jules Verne, and such platitudes as naturally rise to the lips of the most intelligent when they are talking against time, and dealing with a new invention in which it would seem ingenuous to believe too soon; and the question of the telephone carried them safely back to the big house. Mrs. van der Luyden had not yet returned; and Archer took his leave and walked off to fetch the cutter, while Beaufort followed the Countess Olenska indoors. It was probable that, little as the van der Luydens encouraged unannounced visits, he could count on being asked to dine, and sent back to the station to catch the nine o'clock train; but more than that he would certainly not get, for it would be inconceivable to his hosts that a gentleman travelling without luggage should wish to spend the night, and distasteful to them to propose it to a person with whom they were on terms of such limited cordiality as Beaufort. Beaufort knew all this, and must have foreseen it; and his taking the long journey for so small a reward gave the measure of his impatience. He was undeniably in pursuit of the Countess Olenska; and Beaufort had only one object in view in his pursuit of pretty women. His dull and childless home had long since palled on him; and in addition to more permanent consolations he was always in quest of amorous adventures in his own set. This was the man from whom Madame Olenska was avowedly flying: the question was whether she had fled because his importunities displeased her, or because she did not wholly trust herself to resist them; unless, indeed, all her talk of flight had been a blind, and her departure no more than a manoeuvre. Archer did not really believe this. Little as he had actually seen of Madame Olenska, he was beginning to think that he could read her face, and if not her face, her voice; and both had betrayed annoyance, and even dismay, at Beaufort's sudden appearance. But, after all, if this were the case, was it not worse than if she had left New York for the express purpose of meeting him? If she had done that, she ceased to be an object of interest, she threw in her lot with the vulgarest of dissemblers: a woman engaged in a love affair with Beaufort ""classed"" herself irretrievably. No, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably despising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and two societies, his familiar association with artists and actors and people generally in the world's eye, and his careless contempt for local prejudices. Beaufort was vulgar, he was uneducated, he was purse-proud; but the circumstances of his life, and a certain native shrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and socially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the Central Park. How should any one coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it? Madame Olenska, in a burst of irritation, had said to Archer that he and she did not talk the same language; and the young man knew that in some respects this was true. But Beaufort understood every turn of her dialect, and spoke it fluently: his view of life, his tone, his attitude, were merely a coarser reflection of those revealed in Count Olenski's letter. This might seem to be to his disadvantage with Count Olenski's wife; but Archer was too intelligent to think that a young woman like Ellen Olenska would necessarily recoil from everything that reminded her of her past. She might believe herself wholly in revolt against it; but what had charmed her in it would still charm her, even though it were against her will. Thus, with a painful impartiality, did the young man make out the case for Beaufort, and for Beaufort's victim. A longing to enlighten her was strong in him; and there were moments when he imagined that all she asked was to be enlightened. That evening he unpacked his books from London. The box was full of things he had been waiting for impatiently; a new volume of Herbert Spencer, another collection of the prolific Alphonse Daudet's brilliant tales, and a novel called ""Middlemarch,"" as to which there had lately been interesting things said in the reviews. He had declined three dinner invitations in favour of this feast; but though he turned the pages with the sensuous joy of the book-lover, he did not know what he was reading, and one book after another dropped from his hand. Suddenly, among them, he lit on a small volume of verse which he had ordered because the name had attracted him: ""The House of Life."" He took it up, and found himself plunged in an atmosphere unlike any he had ever breathed in books; so warm, so rich, and yet so ineffably tender, that it gave a new and haunting beauty to the most elementary of human passions. All through the night he pursued through those enchanted pages the vision of a woman who had the face of Ellen Olenska; but when he woke the next morning, and looked out at the brownstone houses across the street, and thought of his desk in Mr. Letterblair's office, and the family pew in Grace Church, his hour in the park of Skuytercliff became as far outside the pale of probability as the visions of the night. ""Mercy, how pale you look, Newland!"" Janey commented over the coffee-cups at breakfast; and his mother added: ""Newland, dear, I've noticed lately that you've been coughing; I do hope you're not letting yourself be overworked?"" For it was the conviction of both ladies that, under the iron despotism of his senior partners, the young man's life was spent in the most exhausting professional labours--and he had never thought it necessary to undeceive them. The next two or three days dragged by heavily. The taste of the usual was like cinders in his mouth, and there were moments when he felt as if he were being buried alive under his future. He heard nothing of the Countess Olenska, or of the perfect little house, and though he met Beaufort at the club they merely nodded at each other across the whist-tables. It was not till the fourth evening that he found a note awaiting him on his return home. ""Come late tomorrow: I must explain to you. Ellen."" These were the only words it contained. The young man, who was dining out, thrust the note into his pocket, smiling a little at the Frenchness of the ""to you."" After dinner he went to a play; and it was not until his return home, after midnight, that he drew Madame Olenska's missive out again and re-read it slowly a number of times. There were several ways of answering it, and he gave considerable thought to each one during the watches of an agitated night. That on which, when morning came, he finally decided was to pitch some clothes into a portmanteau and jump on board a boat that was leaving that very afternoon for St. Augustine.  XVI. When Archer walked down the sandy main street of St. Augustine to the house which had been pointed out to him as Mr. Welland's, and saw May Welland standing under a magnolia with the sun in her hair, he wondered why he had waited so long to come. Here was the truth, here was reality, here was the life that belonged to him; and he, who fancied himself so scornful of arbitrary restraints, had been afraid to break away from his desk because of what people might think of his stealing a holiday! Her first exclamation was: ""Newland--has anything happened?"" and it occurred to him that it would have been more ""feminine"" if she had instantly read in his eyes why he had come. But when he answered: ""Yes--I found I had to see you,"" her happy blushes took the chill from her surprise, and he saw how easily he would be forgiven, and how soon even Mr. Letterblair's mild disapproval would be smiled away by a tolerant family. Early as it was, the main street was no place for any but formal greetings, and Archer longed to be alone with May, and to pour out all his tenderness and his impatience. It still lacked an hour to the late Welland breakfast-time, and instead of asking him to come in she proposed that they should walk out to an old orange-garden beyond the town. She had just been for a row on the river, and the sun that netted the little waves with gold seemed to have caught her in its meshes. Across the warm brown of her cheek her blown hair glittered like silver wire; and her eyes too looked lighter, almost pale in their youthful limpidity. As she walked beside Archer with her long swinging gait her face wore the vacant serenity of a young marble athlete. To Archer's strained nerves the vision was as soothing as the sight of the blue sky and the lazy river. They sat down on a bench under the orange-trees and he put his arm about her and kissed her. It was like drinking at a cold spring with the sun on it; but his pressure may have been more vehement than he had intended, for the blood rose to her face and she drew back as if he had startled her. ""What is it?"" he asked, smiling; and she looked at him with surprise, and answered: ""Nothing."" A slight embarrassment fell on them, and her hand slipped out of his. It was the only time that he had kissed her on the lips except for their fugitive embrace in the Beaufort conservatory, and he saw that she was disturbed, and shaken out of her cool boyish composure. ""Tell me what you do all day,"" he said, crossing his arms under his tilted-back head, and pushing his hat forward to screen the sun-dazzle. To let her talk about familiar and simple things was the easiest way of carrying on his own independent train of thought; and he sat listening to her simple chronicle of swimming, sailing and riding, varied by an occasional dance at the primitive inn when a man-of-war came in. A few pleasant people from Philadelphia and Baltimore were picknicking at the inn, and the Selfridge Merrys had come down for three weeks because Kate Merry had had bronchitis. They were planning to lay out a lawn tennis court on the sands; but no one but Kate and May had racquets, and most of the people had not even heard of the game. All this kept her very busy, and she had not had time to do more than look at the little vellum book that Archer had sent her the week before (the ""Sonnets from the Portuguese""); but she was learning by heart ""How they brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,"" because it was one of the first things he had ever read to her; and it amused her to be able to tell him that Kate Merry had never even heard of a poet called Robert Browning. Presently she started up, exclaiming that they would be late for breakfast; and they hurried back to the tumble-down house with its pointless porch and unpruned hedge of plumbago and pink geraniums where the Wellands were installed for the winter. Mr. Welland's sensitive domesticity shrank from the discomforts of the slovenly southern hotel, and at immense expense, and in face of almost insuperable difficulties, Mrs. Welland was obliged, year after year, to improvise an establishment partly made up of discontented New York servants and partly drawn from the local African supply. ""The doctors want my husband to feel that he is in his own home; otherwise he would be so wretched that the climate would not do him any good,"" she explained, winter after winter, to the sympathising Philadelphians and Baltimoreans; and Mr. Welland, beaming across a breakfast table miraculously supplied with the most varied delicacies, was presently saying to Archer: ""You see, my dear fellow, we camp--we literally camp. I tell my wife and May that I want to teach them how to rough it."" Mr. and Mrs. Welland had been as much surprised as their daughter by the young man's sudden arrival; but it had occurred to him to explain that he had felt himself on the verge of a nasty cold, and this seemed to Mr. Welland an all-sufficient reason for abandoning any duty. ""You can't be too careful, especially toward spring,"" he said, heaping his plate with straw-coloured griddle- cakes and drowning them in golden syrup. ""If I'd only been as prudent at your age May would have been dancing at the Assemblies now, instead of spending her winters in a wilderness with an old invalid."" ""Oh, but I love it here, Papa; you know I do. If only Newland could stay I should like it a thousand times better than New York."" ""Newland must stay till he has quite thrown off his cold,"" said Mrs. Welland indulgently; and the young man laughed, and said he supposed there was such a thing as one's profession. He managed, however, after an exchange of telegrams with the firm, to make his cold last a week; and it shed an ironic light on the situation to know that Mr. Letterblair's indulgence was partly due to the satisfactory way in which his brilliant young junior partner had settled the troublesome matter of the Olenski divorce. Mr. Letterblair had let Mrs. Welland know that Mr. Archer had ""rendered an invaluable service"" to the whole family, and that old Mrs. Manson Mingott had been particularly pleased; and one day when May had gone for a drive with her father in the only vehicle the place produced Mrs. Welland took occasion to touch on a topic which she always avoided in her daughter's presence. ""I'm afraid Ellen's ideas are not at all like ours. She was barely eighteen when Medora Manson took her back to Europe--you remember the excitement when she appeared in black at her coming-out ball? Another of Medora's fads--really this time it was almost prophetic! That must have been at least twelve years ago; and since then Ellen has never been to America. No wonder she is completely Europeanised."" ""But European society is not given to divorce: Countess Olenska thought she would be conforming to American ideas in asking for her freedom."" It was the first time that the young man had pronounced her name since he had left Skuytercliff, and he felt the colour rise to his cheek. Mrs. Welland smiled compassionately. ""That is just like the extraordinary things that foreigners invent about us. They think we dine at two o'clock and countenance divorce! That is why it seems to me so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York. They accept our hospitality, and then they go home and repeat the same stupid stories."" Archer made no comment on this, and Mrs. Welland continued: ""But we do most thoroughly appreciate your persuading Ellen to give up the idea. Her grandmother and her uncle Lovell could do nothing with her; both of them have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your influence--in fact she said so to her grandmother. She has an unbounded admiration for you. Poor Ellen--she was always a wayward child. I wonder what her fate will be?"" ""What we've all contrived to make it,"" he felt like answering. ""if you'd all of you rather she should be Beaufort's mistress than some decent fellow's wife you've certainly gone the right way about it."" He wondered what Mrs. Welland would have said if he had uttered the words instead of merely thinking them. He could picture the sudden decomposure of her firm placid features, to which a lifelong mastery over trifles had given an air of factitious authority. Traces still lingered on them of a fresh beauty like her daughter's; and he asked himself if May's face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged image of invincible innocence. Ah, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience! ""I verily believe,"" Mrs. Welland continued, ""that if the horrible business had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband's death-blow. I don't know any of the details; I only ask not to, as I told poor Ellen when she tried to talk to me about it. Having an invalid to care for, I have to keep my mind bright and happy. But Mr. Welland was terribly upset; he had a slight temperature every morning while we were waiting to hear what had been decided. It was the horror of his girl's learning that such things were possible--but of course, dear Newland, you felt that too. We all knew that you were thinking of May."" ""I'm always thinking of May,"" the young man rejoined, rising to cut short the conversation. He had meant to seize the opportunity of his private talk with Mrs. Welland to urge her to advance the date of his marriage. But he could think of no arguments that would move her, and with a sense of relief he saw Mr. Welland and May driving up to the door. His only hope was to plead again with May, and on the day before his departure he walked with her to the ruinous garden of the Spanish Mission. The background lent itself to allusions to European scenes; and May, who was looking her loveliest under a wide-brimmed hat that cast a shadow of mystery over her too-clear eyes, kindled into eagerness as he spoke of Granada and the Alhambra. ""We might be seeing it all this spring--even the Easter ceremonies at Seville,"" he urged, exaggerating his demands in the hope of a larger concession. ""Easter in Seville? And it will be Lent next week!"" she laughed. ""Why shouldn't we be married in Lent?"" he rejoined; but she looked so shocked that he saw his mistake. ""Of course I didn't mean that, dearest; but soon after Easter--so that we could sail at the end of April. I know I could arrange it at the office."" She smiled dreamily upon the possibility; but he perceived that to dream of it sufficed her. It was like hearing him read aloud out of his poetry books the beautiful things that could not possibly happen in real life. ""Oh, do go on, Newland; I do love your descriptions."" ""But why should they be only descriptions? Why shouldn't we make them real?"" ""We shall, dearest, of course; next year."" Her voice lingered over it. ""Don't you want them to be real sooner? Can't I persuade you to break away now?"" She bowed her head, vanishing from him under her conniving hat-brim. ""Why should we dream away another year? Look at me, dear! Don't you understand how I want you for my wife?"" For a moment she remained motionless; then she raised on him eyes of such despairing dearness that he half-released her waist from his hold. But suddenly her look changed and deepened inscrutably. ""I'm not sure if I DO understand,"" she said. ""Is it--is it because you're not certain of continuing to care for me?"" Archer sprang up from his seat. ""My God--perhaps--I don't know,"" he broke out angrily. May Welland rose also; as they faced each other she seemed to grow in womanly stature and dignity. Both were silent for a moment, as if dismayed by the unforeseen trend of their words: then she said in a low voice: ""If that is it--is there some one else?"" ""Some one else--between you and me?"" He echoed her words slowly, as though they were only half- intelligible and he wanted time to repeat the question to himself. She seemed to catch the uncertainty of his voice, for she went on in a deepening tone: ""Let us talk frankly, Newland. Sometimes I've felt a difference in you; especially since our engagement has been announced."" ""Dear--what madness!"" he recovered himself to exclaim. She met his protest with a faint smile. ""If it is, it won't hurt us to talk about it."" She paused, and added, lifting her head with one of her noble movements: ""Or even if it's true: why shouldn't we speak of it? You might so easily have made a mistake."" He lowered his head, staring at the black leaf-pattern on the sunny path at their feet. ""Mistakes are always easy to make; but if I had made one of the kind you suggest, is it likely that I should be imploring you to hasten our marriage?"" She looked downward too, disturbing the pattern with the point of her sunshade while she struggled for expression. ""Yes,"" she said at length. ""You might want-- once for all--to settle the question: it's one way."" Her quiet lucidity startled him, but did not mislead him into thinking her insensible. Under her hat-brim he saw the pallor of her profile, and a slight tremor of the nostril above her resolutely steadied lips. ""Well--?"" he questioned, sitting down on the bench, and looking up at her with a frown that he tried to make playful. She dropped back into her seat and went on: ""You mustn't think that a girl knows as little as her parents imagine. One hears and one notices--one has one's feelings and ideas. And of course, long before you told me that you cared for me, I'd known that there was some one else you were interested in; every one was talking about it two years ago at Newport. And once I saw you sitting together on the verandah at a dance-- and when she came back into the house her face was sad, and I felt sorry for her; I remembered it afterward, when we were engaged."" Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and she sat clasping and unclasping her hands about the handle of her sunshade. The young man laid his upon them with a gentle pressure; his heart dilated with an inexpressible relief. ""My dear child--was THAT it? If you only knew the truth!"" She raised her head quickly. ""Then there is a truth I don't know?"" He kept his hand over hers. ""I meant, the truth about the old story you speak of."" ""But that's what I want to know, Newland--what I ought to know. I couldn't have my happiness made out of a wrong--an unfairness--to somebody else. And I want to believe that it would be the same with you. What sort of a life could we build on such foundations?"" Her face had taken on a look of such tragic courage that he felt like bowing himself down at her feet. ""I've wanted to say this for a long time,"" she went on. ""I've wanted to tell you that, when two people really love each other, I understand that there may be situations which make it right that they should--should go against public opinion. And if you feel yourself in any way pledged . . . pledged to the person we've spoken of . . . and if there is any way . . . any way in which you can fulfill your pledge . . . even by her getting a divorce . . . Newland, don't give her up because of me!"" His surprise at discovering that her fears had fastened upon an episode so remote and so completely of the past as his love-affair with Mrs. Thorley Rushworth gave way to wonder at the generosity of her view. There was something superhuman in an attitude so recklessly unorthodox, and if other problems had not pressed on him he would have been lost in wonder at the prodigy of the Wellands' daughter urging him to marry his former mistress. But he was still dizzy with the glimpse of the precipice they had skirted, and full of a new awe at the mystery of young-girlhood. For a moment he could not speak; then he said: ""There is no pledge--no obligation whatever--of the kind you think. Such cases don't always--present themselves quite as simply as . . . But that's no matter . . . I love your generosity, because I feel as you do about those things . . . I feel that each case must be judged individually, on its own merits . . . irrespective of stupid conventionalities . . . I mean, each woman's right to her liberty--"" He pulled himself up, startled by the turn his thoughts had taken, and went on, looking at her with a smile: ""Since you understand so many things, dearest, can't you go a little farther, and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another form of the same foolish conventionalities? If there's no one and nothing between us, isn't that an argument for marrying quickly, rather than for more delay?"" She flushed with joy and lifted her face to his; as he bent to it he saw that her eyes were full of happy tears. But in another moment she seemed to have descended from her womanly eminence to helpless and timorous girlhood; and he understood that her courage and initiative were all for others, and that she had none for herself. It was evident that the effort of speaking had been much greater than her studied composure betrayed, and that at his first word of reassurance she had dropped back into the usual, as a too-adventurous child takes refuge in its mother's arms. Archer had no heart to go on pleading with her; he was too much disappointed at the vanishing of the new being who had cast that one deep look at him from her transparent eyes. May seemed to be aware of his disappointment, but without knowing how to alleviate it; and they stood up and walked silently home.  XVII. Your cousin the Countess called on mother while you were away,"" Janey Archer announced to her brother on the evening of his return. The young man, who was dining alone with his mother and sister, glanced up in surprise and saw Mrs. Archer's gaze demurely bent on her plate. Mrs. Archer did not regard her seclusion from the world as a reason for being forgotten by it; and Newland guessed that she was slightly annoyed that he should be surprised by Madame Olenska's visit. ""She had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons, and a tiny green monkey muff; I never saw her so stylishly dressed,"" Janey continued. ""She came alone, early on Sunday afternoon; luckily the fire was lit in the drawing-room. She had one of those new card- cases. She said she wanted to know us because you'd been so good to her."" Newland laughed. ""Madame Olenska always takes that tone about her friends. She's very happy at being among her own people again."" ""Yes, so she told us,"" said Mrs. Archer. ""I must say she seems thankful to be here."" ""I hope you liked her, mother."" Mrs. Archer drew her lips together. ""She certainly lays herself out to please, even when she is calling on an old lady."" ""Mother doesn't think her simple,"" Janey interjected, her eyes screwed upon her brother's face. ""It's just my old-fashioned feeling; dear May is my ideal,"" said Mrs. Archer. ""Ah,"" said her son, ""they're not alike.""  Archer had left St. Augustine charged with many messages for old Mrs. Mingott; and a day or two after his return to town he called on her. The old lady received him with unusual warmth; she was grateful to him for persuading the Countess Olenska to give up the idea of a divorce; and when he told her that he had deserted the office without leave, and rushed down to St. Augustine simply because he wanted to see May, she gave an adipose chuckle and patted his knee with her puff-ball hand. ""Ah, ah--so you kicked over the traces, did you? And I suppose Augusta and Welland pulled long faces, and behaved as if the end of the world had come? But little May--she knew better, I'll be bound?"" ""I hoped she did; but after all she wouldn't agree to what I'd gone down to ask for."" ""Wouldn't she indeed? And what was that?"" ""I wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in April. What's the use of our wasting another year?"" Mrs. Manson Mingott screwed up her little mouth into a grimace of mimic prudery and twinkled at him through malicious lids. ""`Ask Mamma,' I suppose-- the usual story. Ah, these Mingotts--all alike! Born in a rut, and you can't root 'em out of it. When I built this house you'd have thought I was moving to California! Nobody ever HAD built above Fortieth Street--no, says I, nor above the Battery either, before Christopher Columbus discovered America. No, no; not one of them wants to be different; they're as scared of it as the small-pox. Ah, my dear Mr. Archer, I thank my stars I'm nothing but a vulgar Spicer; but there's not one of my own children that takes after me but my little Ellen."" She broke off, still twinkling at him, and asked, with the casual irrelevance of old age: ""Now, why in the world didn't you marry my little Ellen?"" Archer laughed. ""For one thing, she wasn't there to be married."" ""No--to be sure; more's the pity. And now it's too late; her life is finished."" She spoke with the cold- blooded complacency of the aged throwing earth into the grave of young hopes. The young man's heart grew chill, and he said hurriedly: ""Can't I persuade you to use your influence with the Wellands, Mrs. Mingott? I wasn't made for long engagements."" Old Catherine beamed on him approvingly. ""No; I can see that. You've got a quick eye. When you were a little boy I've no doubt you liked to be helped first."" She threw back her head with a laugh that made her chins ripple like little waves. ""Ah, here's my Ellen now!"" she exclaimed, as the portieres parted behind her. Madame Olenska came forward with a smile. Her face looked vivid and happy, and she held out her hand gaily to Archer while she stooped to her grandmother's kiss. ""I was just saying to him, my dear: `Now, why didn't you marry my little Ellen?'"" Madame Olenska looked at Archer, still smiling. ""And what did he answer?"" ""Oh, my darling, I leave you to find that out! He's been down to Florida to see his sweetheart."" ""Yes, I know."" She still looked at him. ""I went to see your mother, to ask where you'd gone. I sent a note that you never answered, and I was afraid you were ill."" He muttered something about leaving unexpectedly, in a great hurry, and having intended to write to her from St. Augustine. ""And of course once you were there you never thought of me again!"" She continued to beam on him with a gaiety that might have been a studied assumption of indifference. ""If she still needs me, she's determined not to let me see it,"" he thought, stung by her manner. He wanted to thank her for having been to see his mother, but under the ancestress's malicious eye he felt himself tongue- tied and constrained. ""Look at him--in such hot haste to get married that he took French leave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees! That's something like a lover-- that's the way handsome Bob Spicer carried off my poor mother; and then got tired of her before I was weaned--though they only had to wait eight months for me! But there--you're not a Spicer, young man; luckily for you and for May. It's only my poor Ellen that has kept any of their wicked blood; the rest of them are all model Mingotts,"" cried the old lady scornfully. Archer was aware that Madame Olenska, who had seated herself at her grandmother's side, was still thoughtfully scrutinising him. The gaiety had faded from her eyes, and she said with great gentleness: ""Surely, Granny, we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes."" Archer rose to go, and as his hand met Madame Olenska's he felt that she was waiting for him to make some allusion to her unanswered letter. ""When can I see you?"" he asked, as she walked with him to the door of the room. ""Whenever you like; but it must be soon if you want to see the little house again. I am moving next week."" A pang shot through him at the memory of his lamplit hours in the low-studded drawing-room. Few as they had been, they were thick with memories. ""Tomorrow evening?"" She nodded. ""Tomorrow; yes; but early. I'm going out."" The next day was a Sunday, and if she were ""going out"" on a Sunday evening it could, of course, be only to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers's. He felt a slight movement of annoyance, not so much at her going there (for he rather liked her going where she pleased in spite of the van der Luydens), but because it was the kind of house at which she was sure to meet Beaufort, where she must have known beforehand that she would meet him--and where she was probably going for that purpose. ""Very well; tomorrow evening,"" he repeated, inwardly resolved that he would not go early, and that by reaching her door late he would either prevent her from going to Mrs. Struthers's, or else arrive after she had started--which, all things considered, would no doubt be the simplest solution.  It was only half-past eight, after all, when he rang the bell under the wisteria; not as late as he had intended by half an hour--but a singular restlessness had driven him to her door. He reflected, however, that Mrs. Struthers's Sunday evenings were not like a ball, and that her guests, as if to minimise their delinquency, usually went early. The one thing he had not counted on, in entering Madame Olenska's hall, was to find hats and overcoats there. Why had she bidden him to come early if she was having people to dine? On a closer inspection of the garments besides which Nastasia was laying his own, his resentment gave way to curiosity. The overcoats were in fact the very strangest he had ever seen under a polite roof; and it took but a glance to assure himself that neither of them belonged to Julius Beaufort. One was a shaggy yellow ulster of ""reach-me- down"" cut, the other a very old and rusty cloak with a cape--something like what the French called a ""Macfarlane."" This garment, which appeared to be made for a person of prodigious size, had evidently seen long and hard wear, and its greenish-black folds gave out a moist sawdusty smell suggestive of prolonged sessions against bar-room walls. On it lay a ragged grey scarf and an odd felt hat of semiclerical shape. Archer raised his eyebrows enquiringly at Nastasia, who raised hers in return with a fatalistic ""Gia!"" as she threw open the drawing-room door. The young man saw at once that his hostess was not in the room; then, with surprise, he discovered another lady standing by the fire. This lady, who was long, lean and loosely put together, was clad in raiment intricately looped and fringed, with plaids and stripes and bands of plain colour disposed in a design to which the clue seemed missing. Her hair, which had tried to turn white and only succeeded in fading, was surmounted by a Spanish comb and black lace scarf, and silk mittens, visibly darned, covered her rheumatic hands. Beside her, in a cloud of cigar-smoke, stood the owners of the two overcoats, both in morning clothes that they had evidently not taken off since morning. In one of the two, Archer, to his surprise, recognised Ned Winsett; the other and older, who was unknown to him, and whose gigantic frame declared him to be the wearer of the ""Macfarlane,"" had a feebly leonine head with crumpled grey hair, and moved his arms with large pawing gestures, as though he were distributing lay blessings to a kneeling multitude. These three persons stood together on the hearth- rug, their eyes fixed on an extraordinarily large bouquet of crimson roses, with a knot of purple pansies at their base, that lay on the sofa where Madame Olenska usually sat. ""What they must have cost at this season--though of course it's the sentiment one cares about!"" the lady was saying in a sighing staccato as Archer came in. The three turned with surprise at his appearance, and the lady, advancing, held out her hand. ""Dear Mr. Archer--almost my cousin Newland!"" she said. ""I am the Marchioness Manson."" Archer bowed, and she continued: ""My Ellen has taken me in for a few days. I came from Cuba, where I have been spending the winter with Spanish friends-- such delightful distinguished people: the highest nobility of old Castile--how I wish you could know them! Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton But I was called away by our dear great friend here, Dr. Carver. You don't know Dr. Agathon Carver, founder of the Valley of Love Community?"" Dr. Carver inclined his leonine head, and the Marchioness continued: ""Ah, New York--New York--how little the life of the spirit has reached it! But I see you do know Mr. Winsett."" ""Oh, yes--I reached him some time ago; but not by that route,"" Winsett said with his dry smile. The Marchioness shook her head reprovingly. ""How do you know, Mr. Winsett? The spirit bloweth where it listeth."" ""List--oh, list!"" interjected Dr. Carver in a stentorian murmur. ""But do sit down, Mr. Archer. We four have been having a delightful little dinner together, and my child has gone up to dress. She expects you; she will be down in a moment. We were just admiring these marvellous flowers, which will surprise her when she reappears."" Winsett remained on his feet. ""I'm afraid I must be off. Please tell Madame Olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our street. This house has been an oasis."" ""Ah, but she won't abandon YOU. Poetry and art are the breath of life to her. It IS poetry you write, Mr. Winsett?"" ""Well, no; but I sometimes read it,"" said Winsett, including the group in a general nod and slipping out of the room. ""A caustic spirit--un peu sauvage. But so witty; Dr. Carver, you DO think him witty?"" ""I never think of wit,"" said Dr. Carver severely. ""Ah--ah--you never think of wit! How merciless he is to us weak mortals, Mr. Archer! But he lives only in the life of the spirit; and tonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently at Mrs. Blenker's. Dr. Carver, would there be time, before you start for the Blenkers' to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery of the Direct Contact? But no; I see it is nearly nine o'clock, and we have no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message."" Dr. Carver looked slightly disappointed at this conclusion, but, having compared his ponderous gold time- piece with Madame Olenska's little travelling-clock, he reluctantly gathered up his mighty limbs for departure. ""I shall see you later, dear friend?"" he suggested to the Marchioness, who replied with a smile: ""As soon as Ellen's carriage comes I will join you; I do hope the lecture won't have begun."" Dr. Carver looked thoughtfully at Archer. ""Perhaps, if this young gentleman is interested in my experiences, Mrs. Blenker might allow you to bring him with you?"" ""Oh, dear friend, if it were possible--I am sure she would be too happy. But I fear my Ellen counts on Mr. Archer herself."" ""That,"" said Dr. Carver, ""is unfortunate--but here is my card."" He handed it to Archer, who read on it, in Gothic characters:  |---------------------------| | Agathon Carter  | |  The Valley of Love | |  Kittasquattamy, N. Y.  | |---------------------------|  Dr. Carver bowed himself out, and Mrs. Manson, with a sigh that might have been either of regret or relief, again waved Archer to a seat. ""Ellen will be down in a moment; and before she comes, I am so glad of this quiet moment with you."" Archer murmured his pleasure at their meeting, and the Marchioness continued, in her low sighing accents: ""I know everything, dear Mr. Archer--my child has told me all you have done for her. Your wise advice: your courageous firmness--thank heaven it was not too late!"" The young man listened with considerable embarrassment. Was there any one, he wondered, to whom Madame Olenska had not proclaimed his intervention in her private affairs? ""Madame Olenska exaggerates; I simply gave her a legal opinion, as she asked me to."" ""Ah, but in doing it--in doing it you were the unconscious instrument of--of--what word have we moderns for Providence, Mr. Archer?"" cried the lady, tilting her head on one side and drooping her lids mysteriously. ""Little did you know that at that very moment I was being appealed to: being approached, in fact--from the other side of the Atlantic!"" She glanced over her shoulder, as though fearful of being overheard, and then, drawing her chair nearer, and raising a tiny ivory fan to her lips, breathed behind it: ""By the Count himself--my poor, mad, foolish Olenski; who asks only to take her back on her own terms."" ""Good God!"" Archer exclaimed, springing up. ""You are horrified? Yes, of course; I understand. I don't defend poor Stanislas, though he has always called me his best friend. He does not defend himself--he casts himself at her feet: in my person."" She tapped her emaciated bosom. ""I have his letter here."" ""A letter?--Has Madame Olenska seen it?"" Archer stammered, his brain whirling with the shock of the announcement. The Marchioness Manson shook her head softly. ""Time--time; I must have time. I know my Ellen-- haughty, intractable; shall I say, just a shade unforgiving?"" ""But, good heavens, to forgive is one thing; to go back into that hell--"" ""Ah, yes,"" the Marchioness acquiesced. ""So she describes it--my sensitive child! But on the material side, Mr. Archer, if one may stoop to consider such things; do you know what she is giving up? Those roses there on the sofa--acres like them, under glass and in the open, in his matchless terraced gardens at Nice! Jewels-- historic pearls: the Sobieski emeralds--sables,--but she cares nothing for all these! Art and beauty, those she does care for, she lives for, as I always have; and those also surrounded her. Pictures, priceless furniture, music, brilliant conversation--ah, that, my dear young man, if you'll excuse me, is what you've no conception of here! And she had it all; and the homage of the greatest. She tells me she is not thought handsome in New York--good heavens! Her portrait has been painted nine times; the greatest artists in Europe have begged for the privilege. Are these things nothing? And the remorse of an adoring husband?"" As the Marchioness Manson rose to her climax her face assumed an expression of ecstatic retrospection which would have moved Archer's mirth had he not been numb with amazement. He would have laughed if any one had foretold to him that his first sight of poor Medora Manson would have been in the guise of a messenger of Satan; but he was in no mood for laughing now, and she seemed to him to come straight out of the hell from which Ellen Olenska had just escaped. ""She knows nothing yet--of all this?"" he asked abruptly. Mrs. Manson laid a purple finger on her lips. ""Nothing directly--but does she suspect? Who can tell? The truth is, Mr. Archer, I have been waiting to see you. From the moment I heard of the firm stand you had taken, and of your influence over her, I hoped it might be possible to count on your support--to convince you . . ."" ""That she ought to go back? I would rather see her dead!"" cried the young man violently. ""Ah,"" the Marchioness murmured, without visible resentment. For a while she sat in her arm-chair, opening and shutting the absurd ivory fan between her mittened fingers; but suddenly she lifted her head and listened. ""Here she comes,"" she said in a rapid whisper; and then, pointing to the bouquet on the sofa: ""Am I to understand that you prefer THAT, Mr. Archer? After all, marriage is marriage . . . and my niece is still a wife. . .  XVIII. What are you two plotting together, aunt Medora?"" Madame Olenska cried as she came into the room. She was dressed as if for a ball. Everything about her shimmered and glimmered softly, as if her dress had been woven out of candle-beams; and she carried her head high, like a pretty woman challenging a roomful of rivals. ""We were saying, my dear, that here was something beautiful to surprise you with,"" Mrs. Manson rejoined, rising to her feet and pointing archly to the flowers. Madame Olenska stopped short and looked at the bouquet. Her colour did not change, but a sort of white radiance of anger ran over her like summer lightning. ""Ah,"" she exclaimed, in a shrill voice that the young man had never heard, ""who is ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet? Why a bouquet? And why tonight of all nights? I am not going to a ball; I am not a girl engaged to be married. But some people are always ridiculous."" She turned back to the door, opened it, and called out: ""Nastasia!"" The ubiquitous handmaiden promptly appeared, and Archer heard Madame Olenska say, in an Italian that she seemed to pronounce with intentional deliberateness in order that he might follow it: ""Here--throw this into the dustbin!"" and then, as Nastasia stared protestingly: ""But no--it's not the fault of the poor flowers. Tell the boy to carry them to the house three doors away, the house of Mr. Winsett, the dark gentleman who dined here. His wife is ill--they may give her pleasure . . . The boy is out, you say? Then, my dear one, run yourself; here, put my cloak over you and fly. I want the thing out of the house immediately! And, as you live, don't say they come from me!"" She flung her velvet opera cloak over the maid's shoulders and turned back into the drawing-room, shutting the door sharply. Her bosom was rising high under its lace, and for a moment Archer thought she was about to cry; but she burst into a laugh instead, and looking from the Marchioness to Archer, asked abruptly: ""And you two--have you made friends!"" ""It's for Mr. Archer to say, darling; he has waited patiently while you were dressing."" ""Yes--I gave you time enough: my hair wouldn't go,"" Madame Olenska said, raising her hand to the heaped-up curls of her chignon. ""But that reminds me: I see Dr. Carver is gone, and you'll be late at the Blenkers'. Mr. Archer, will you put my aunt in the carriage?"" She followed the Marchioness into the hall, saw her fitted into a miscellaneous heap of overshoes, shawls and tippets, and called from the doorstep: ""Mind, the carriage is to be back for me at ten!"" Then she returned to the drawing-room, where Archer, on re-entering it, found her standing by the mantelpiece, examining herself in the mirror. It was not usual, in New York society, for a lady to address her parlour-maid as ""my dear one,"" and send her out on an errand wrapped in her own opera-cloak; and Archer, through all his deeper feelings, tasted the pleasurable excitement of being in a world where action followed on emotion with such Olympian speed. Madame Olenska did not move when he came up behind her, and for a second their eyes met in the mirror; then she turned, threw herself into her sofa- corner, and sighed out: ""There's time for a cigarette."" He handed her the box and lit a spill for her; and as the flame flashed up into her face she glanced at him with laughing eyes and said: ""What do you think of me in a temper?"" Archer paused a moment; then he answered with sudden resolution: ""It makes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you."" ""I knew she'd been talking about me. Well?"" ""She said you were used to all kinds of things-- splendours and amusements and excitements--that we could never hope to give you here."" Madame Olenska smiled faintly into the circle of smoke about her lips. ""Medora is incorrigibly romantic. It has made up to her for so many things!"" Archer hesitated again, and again took his risk. ""Is your aunt's romanticism always consistent with accuracy?"" ""You mean: does she speak the truth?"" Her niece considered. ""Well, I'll tell you: in almost everything she says, there's something true and something untrue. But why do you ask? What has she been telling you?"" He looked away into the fire, and then back at her shining presence. His heart tightened with the thought that this was their last evening by that fireside, and that in a moment the carriage would come to carry her away. ""She says--she pretends that Count Olenski has asked her to persuade you to go back to him."" Madame Olenska made no answer. She sat motionless, holding her cigarette in her half-lifted hand. The expression of her face had not changed; and Archer remembered that he had before noticed her apparent incapacity for surprise. ""You knew, then?"" he broke out. She was silent for so long that the ash dropped from her cigarette. She brushed it to the floor. ""She has hinted about a letter: poor darling! Medora's hints--"" ""Is it at your husband's request that she has arrived here suddenly?"" Madame Olenska seemed to consider this question also. ""There again: one can't tell. She told me she had had a `spiritual summons,' whatever that is, from Dr. Carver. I'm afraid she's going to marry Dr. Carver . . . poor Medora, there's always some one she wants to marry. But perhaps the people in Cuba just got tired of her! I think she was with them as a sort of paid companion. Really, I don't know why she came."" ""But you do believe she has a letter from your husband?"" Again Madame Olenska brooded silently; then she said: ""After all, it was to be expected."" The young man rose and went to lean against the fireplace. A sudden restlessness possessed him, and he was tongue-tied by the sense that their minutes were numbered, and that at any moment he might hear the wheels of the returning carriage. ""You know that your aunt believes you will go back?"" Madame Olenska raised her head quickly. A deep blush rose to her face and spread over her neck and shoulders. She blushed seldom and painfully, as if it hurt her like a burn. ""Many cruel things have been believed of me,"" she said. ""Oh, Ellen--forgive me; I'm a fool and a brute!"" She smiled a little. ""You are horribly nervous; you have your own troubles. I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your marriage, and of course I agree with you. In Europe people don't understand our long American engagements; I suppose they are not as calm as we are."" She pronounced the ""we"" with a faint emphasis that gave it an ironic sound. Archer felt the irony but did not dare to take it up. After all, she had perhaps purposely deflected the conversation from her own affairs, and after the pain his last words had evidently caused her he felt that all he could do was to follow her lead. But the sense of the waning hour made him desperate: he could not bear the thought that a barrier of words should drop between them again. ""Yes,"" he said abruptly; ""I went south to ask May to marry me after Easter. There's no reason why we shouldn't be married then."" ""And May adores you--and yet you couldn't convince her? I thought her too intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions."" ""She IS too intelligent--she's not their slave."" Madame Olenska looked at him. ""Well, then--I don't understand."" Archer reddened, and hurried on with a rush. ""We had a frank talk--almost the first. She thinks my impatience a bad sign."" ""Merciful heavens--a bad sign?"" ""She thinks it means that I can't trust myself to go on caring for her. She thinks, in short, I want to marry her at once to get away from some one that I--care for more."" Madame Olenska examined this curiously. ""But if she thinks that--why isn't she in a hurry too?"" ""Because she's not like that: she's so much nobler. She insists all the more on the long engagement, to give me time--"" ""Time to give her up for the other woman?"" ""If I want to."" Madame Olenska leaned toward the fire and gazed into it with fixed eyes. Down the quiet street Archer heard the approaching trot of her horses. ""That IS noble,"" she said, with a slight break in her voice. ""Yes. But it's ridiculous."" ""Ridiculous? Because you don't care for any one else?"" ""Because I don't mean to marry any one else."" ""Ah."" There was another long interval. At length she looked up at him and asked: ""This other woman-- does she love you?"" ""Oh, there's no other woman; I mean, the person that May was thinking of is--was never--"" ""Then, why, after all, are you in such haste?"" ""There's your carriage,"" said Archer. She half-rose and looked about her with absent eyes. Her fan and gloves lay on the sofa beside her and she picked them up mechanically. ""Yes; I suppose I must be going."" ""You're going to Mrs. Struthers's?"" ""Yes."" She smiled and added: ""I must go where I am invited, or I should be too lonely. Why not come with me?"" Archer felt that at any cost he must keep her beside him, must make her give him the rest of her evening. Ignoring her question, he continued to lean against the chimney-piece, his eyes fixed on the hand in which she held her gloves and fan, as if watching to see if he had the power to make her drop them. ""May guessed the truth,"" he said. ""There is another woman--but not the one she thinks."" Ellen Olenska made no answer, and did not move. After a moment he sat down beside her, and, taking her hand, softly unclasped it, so that the gloves and fan fell on the sofa between them. She started up, and freeing herself from him moved away to the other side of the hearth. ""Ah, don't make love to me! Too many people have done that,"" she said, frowning. Archer, changing colour, stood up also: it was the bitterest rebuke she could have given him. ""I have never made love to you,"" he said, ""and I never shall. But you are the woman I would have married if it had been possible for either of us."" ""Possible for either of us?"" She looked at him with unfeigned astonishment. ""And you say that--when it's you who've made it impossible?"" He stared at her, groping in a blackness through which a single arrow of light tore its blinding way. ""I'VE made it impossible--?"" ""You, you, YOU!"" she cried, her lip trembling like a child's on the verge of tears. ""Isn't it you who made me give up divorcing--give it up because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was, how one must sacrifice one's self to preserve the dignity of marriage . . . and to spare one's family the publicity, the scandal? And because my family was going to be your family--for May's sake and for yours--I did what you told me, what you proved to me that I ought to do. Ah,"" she broke out with a sudden laugh, ""I've made no secret of having done it for you!"" She sank down on the sofa again, crouching among the festive ripples of her dress like a stricken masquerader; and the young man stood by the fireplace and continued to gaze at her without moving. ""Good God,"" he groaned. ""When I thought--"" ""You thought?"" ""Ah, don't ask me what I thought!"" Still looking at her, he saw the same burning flush creep up her neck to her face. She sat upright, facing him with a rigid dignity. ""I do ask you."" ""Well, then: there were things in that letter you asked me to read--"" ""My husband's letter?"" ""Yes."" ""I had nothing to fear from that letter: absolutely nothing! All I feared was to bring notoriety, scandal, on the family--on you and May."" ""Good God,"" he groaned again, bowing his face in his hands. The silence that followed lay on them with the weight of things final and irrevocable. It seemed to Archer to be crushing him down like his own grave-stone; in all the wide future he saw nothing that would ever lift that load from his heart. He did not move from his place, or raise his head from his hands; his hidden eyeballs went on staring into utter darkness. ""At least I loved you--"" he brought out. On the other side of the hearth, from the sofa-corner where he supposed that she still crouched, he heard a faint stifled crying like a child's. He started up and came to her side. ""Ellen! What madness! Why are you crying? Nothing's done that can't be undone. I'm still free, and you're going to be."" He had her in his arms, her face like a wet flower at his lips, and all their vain terrors shrivelling up like ghosts at sunrise. The one thing that astonished him now was that he should have stood for five minutes arguing with her across the width of the room, when just touching her made everything so simple. She gave him back all his kiss, but after a moment he felt her stiffening in his arms, and she put him aside and stood up. ""Ah, my poor Newland--I suppose this had to be. But it doesn't in the least alter things,"" she said, looking down at him in her turn from the hearth. ""It alters the whole of life for me."" ""No, no--it mustn't, it can't. You're engaged to May Welland; and I'm married."" He stood up too, flushed and resolute. ""Nonsense! It's too late for that sort of thing. We've no right to lie to other people or to ourselves. We won't talk of your marriage; but do you see me marrying May after this?"" She stood silent, resting her thin elbows on the mantelpiece, her profile reflected in the glass behind her. One of the locks of her chignon had become loosened and hung on her neck; she looked haggard and almost old. ""I don't see you,"" she said at length, ""putting that question to May. Do you?"" He gave a reckless shrug. ""It's too late to do anything else."" ""You say that because it's the easiest thing to say at this moment--not because it's true. In reality it's too late to do anything but what we'd both decided on."" ""Ah, I don't understand you!"" She forced a pitiful smile that pinched her face instead of smoothing it. ""You don't understand because you haven't yet guessed how you've changed things for me: oh, from the first--long before I knew all you'd done."" ""All I'd done?"" ""Yes. I was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy of me--that they thought I was a dreadful sort of person. It seems they had even refused to meet me at dinner. I found that out afterward; and how you'd made your mother go with you to the van der Luydens'; and how you'd insisted on announcing your engagement at the Beaufort ball, so that I might have two families to stand by me instead of one--"" At that he broke into a laugh. ""Just imagine,"" she said, ""how stupid and unobservant I was! I knew nothing of all this till Granny blurted it out one day. New York simply meant peace and freedom to me: it was coming home. And I was so happy at being among my own people that every one I met seemed kind and good, and glad to see me. But from the very beginning,"" she continued, ""I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons that I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard and--unnecessary. The very good people didn't convince me; I felt they'd never been tempted. But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands--and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I'd never known before--and it's better than anything I've known."" She spoke in a low even voice, without tears or visible agitation; and each word, as it dropped from her, fell into his breast like burning lead. He sat bowed over, his head between his hands, staring at the hearthrug, and at the tip of the satin shoe that showed under her dress. Suddenly he knelt down and kissed the shoe. She bent over him, laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking at him with eyes so deep that he remained motionless under her gaze. ""Ah, don't let us undo what you've done!"" she cried. ""I can't go back now to that other way of thinking. I can't love you unless I give you up."" His arms were yearning up to her; but she drew away, and they remained facing each other, divided by the distance that her words had created. Then, abruptly, his anger overflowed. ""And Beaufort? Is he to replace me?"" As the words sprang out he was prepared for an answering flare of anger; and he would have welcomed it as fuel for his own. But Madame Olenska only grew a shade paler, and stood with her arms hanging down before her, and her head slightly bent, as her way was when she pondered a question. ""He's waiting for you now at Mrs. Struthers's; why don't you go to him?"" Archer sneered. She turned to ring the bell. ""I shall not go out this evening; tell the carriage to go and fetch the Signora Marchesa,"" she said when the maid came. After the door had closed again Archer continued to look at her with bitter eyes. ""Why this sacrifice? Since you tell me that you're lonely I've no right to keep you from your friends."" She smiled a little under her wet lashes. ""I shan't be lonely now. I WAS lonely; I WAS afraid. But the emptiness and the darkness are gone; when I turn back into myself now I'm like a child going at night into a room where there's always a light."" Her tone and her look still enveloped her in a soft inaccessibility, and Archer groaned out again: ""I don't understand you!"" ""Yet you understand May!"" He reddened under the retort, but kept his eyes on her. ""May is ready to give me up."" ""What! Three days after you've entreated her on your knees to hasten your marriage?"" ""She's refused; that gives me the right--"" ""Ah, you've taught me what an ugly word that is,"" she said. He turned away with a sense of utter weariness. He felt as though he had been struggling for hours up the face of a steep precipice, and now, just as he had fought his way to the top, his hold had given way and he was pitching down headlong into darkness. If he could have got her in his arms again he might have swept away her arguments; but she still held him at a distance by something inscrutably aloof in her look and attitude, and by his own awed sense of her sincerity. At length he began to plead again. ""If we do this now it will be worse afterward--worse for every one--"" ""No--no--no!"" she almost screamed, as if he frightened her. At that moment the bell sent a long tinkle through the house. They had heard no carriage stopping at the door, and they stood motionless, looking at each other with startled eyes. Outside, Nastasia's step crossed the hall, the outer door opened, and a moment later she came in carrying a telegram which she handed to the Countess Olenska. ""The lady was very happy at the flowers,"" Nastasia said, smoothing her apron. ""She thought it was her signor marito who had sent them, and she cried a little and said it was a folly."" Her mistress smiled and took the yellow envelope. She tore it open and carried it to the lamp; then, when the door had closed again, she handed the telegram to Archer. It was dated from St. Augustine, and addressed to the Countess Olenska. In it he read: ""Granny's telegram successful. Papa and Mamma agree marriage after Easter. Am telegraphing Newland. Am too happy for words and love you dearly. Your grateful May.""  Half an hour later, when Archer unlocked his own front-door, he found a similar envelope on the hall-table on top of his pile of notes and letters. The message inside the envelope was also from May Welland, and ran as follows: ""Parents consent wedding Tuesday after Easter at twelve Grace Church eight bridesmaids please see Rector so happy love May."" Archer crumpled up the yellow sheet as if the gesture could annihilate the news it contained. Then he pulled out a small pocket-diary and turned over the pages with trembling fingers; but he did not find what he wanted, and cramming the telegram into his pocket he mounted the stairs. A light was shining through the door of the little hall-room which served Janey as a dressing-room and boudoir, and her brother rapped impatiently on the panel. The door opened, and his sister stood before him in her immemorial purple flannel dressing-gown, with her hair ""on pins."" Her face looked pale and apprehensive. ""Newland! I hope there's no bad news in that telegram? I waited on purpose, in case--"" (No item of his correspondence was safe from Janey.) He took no notice of her question. ""Look here-- what day is Easter this year?"" She looked shocked at such unchristian ignorance. ""Easter? Newland! Why, of course, the first week in April. Why?"" ""The first week?"" He turned again to the pages of his diary, calculating rapidly under his breath. ""The first week, did you say?"" He threw back his head with a long laugh. ""For mercy's sake what's the matter?"" ""Nothing's the matter, except that I'm going to be married in a month."" Janey fell upon his neck and pressed him to her purple flannel breast. ""Oh Newland, how wonderful! I'm so glad! But, dearest, why do you keep on laughing? Do hush, or you'll wake Mamma."" Book II  XIX. The day was fresh, with a lively spring wind full of dust. All the old ladies in both families had got out their faded sables and yellowing ermines, and the smell of camphor from the front pews almost smothered the faint spring scent of the lilies banking the altar. Newland Archer, at a signal from the sexton, had come out of the vestry and placed himself with his best man on the chancel step of Grace Church. The signal meant that the brougham bearing the bride and her father was in sight; but there was sure to be a considerable interval of adjustment and consultation in the lobby, where the bridesmaids were already hovering like a cluster of Easter blossoms. During this unavoidable lapse of time the bridegroom, in proof of his eagerness, was expected to expose himself alone to the gaze of the assembled company; and Archer had gone through this formality as resignedly as through all the others which made of a nineteenth century New York wedding a rite that seemed to belong to the dawn of history. Everything was equally easy--or equally painful, as one chose to put it--in the path he was committed to tread, and he had obeyed the flurried injunctions of his best man as piously as other bridegrooms had obeyed his own, in the days when he had guided them through the same labyrinth. So far he was reasonably sure of having fulfilled all his obligations. The bridesmaids' eight bouquets of white lilac and lilies-of-the-valley had been sent in due time, as well as the gold and sapphire sleeve-links of the eight ushers and the best man's cat's-eye scarf-pin; Archer had sat up half the night trying to vary the wording of his thanks for the last batch of presents from men friends and ex-lady-loves; the fees for the Bishop and the Rector were safely in the pocket of his best man; his own luggage was already at Mrs. Manson Mingott's, where the wedding-breakfast was to take place, and so were the travelling clothes into which he was to change; and a private compartment had been engaged in the train that was to carry the young couple to their unknown destination--concealment of the spot in which the bridal night was to be spent being one of the most sacred taboos of the prehistoric ritual. ""Got the ring all right?"" whispered young van der Luyden Newland, who was inexperienced in the duties of a best man, and awed by the weight of his responsibility. Archer made the gesture which he had seen so many bridegrooms make: with his ungloved right hand he felt in the pocket of his dark grey waistcoat, and assured himself that the little gold circlet (engraved inside: Newland to May, April ---, 187-) was in its place; then, resuming his former attitude, his tall hat and pearl-grey gloves with black stitchings grasped in his left hand, he stood looking at the door of the church. Overhead, Handel's March swelled pompously through the imitation stone vaulting, carrying on its waves the faded drift of the many weddings at which, with cheerful indifference, he had stood on the same chancel step watching other brides float up the nave toward other bridegrooms. ""How like a first night at the Opera!"" he thought, recognising all the same faces in the same boxes (no, pews), and wondering if, when the Last Trump sounded, Mrs. Selfridge Merry would be there with the same towering ostrich feathers in her bonnet, and Mrs. Beaufort with the same diamond earrings and the same smile--and whether suitable proscenium seats were already prepared for them in another world. After that there was still time to review, one by one, the familiar countenances in the first rows; the women's sharp with curiosity and excitement, the men's sulky with the obligation of having to put on their frock-coats before luncheon, and fight for food at the wedding-breakfast. ""Too bad the breakfast is at old Catherine's,"" the bridegroom could fancy Reggie Chivers saying. ""But I'm told that Lovell Mingott insisted on its being cooked by his own chef, so it ought to be good if one can only get at it."" And he could imagine Sillerton Jackson adding with authority: ""My dear fellow, haven't you heard? It's to be served at small tables, in the new English fashion."" Archer's eyes lingered a moment on the left-hand pew, where his mother, who had entered the church on Mr. Henry van der Luyden's arm, sat weeping softly under her Chantilly veil, her hands in her grandmother's ermine muff. ""Poor Janey!"" he thought, looking at his sister, ""even by screwing her head around she can see only the people in the few front pews; and they're mostly dowdy Newlands and Dagonets."" On the hither side of the white ribbon dividing off the seats reserved for the families he saw Beaufort, tall and redfaced, scrutinising the women with his arrogant stare. Beside him sat his wife, all silvery chinchilla and violets; and on the far side of the ribbon, Lawrence Lefferts's sleekly brushed head seemed to mount guard over the invisible deity of ""Good Form"" who presided at the ceremony. Archer wondered how many flaws Lefferts's keen eyes would discover in the ritual of his divinity; then he suddenly recalled that he too had once thought such questions important. The things that had filled his days seemed now like a nursery parody of life, or like the wrangles of mediaeval schoolmen over metaphysical terms that nobody had ever understood. A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be ""shown"" had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and it seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles, and that the matter should have been decided (in the negative) by Mrs. Welland's saying, with indignant tears: ""I should as soon turn the reporters loose in my house."" Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with world-wide significance. ""And all the while, I suppose,"" he thought, ""real people were living somewhere, and real things happening to them . . ."" ""THERE THEY COME!"" breathed the best man excitedly; but the bridegroom knew better. The cautious opening of the door of the church meant only that Mr. Brown the livery-stable keeper (gowned in black in his intermittent character of sexton) was taking a preliminary survey of the scene before marshalling his forces. The door was softly shut again; then after another interval it swung majestically open, and a murmur ran through the church: ""The family!"" Mrs. Welland came first, on the arm of her eldest son. Her large pink face was appropriately solemn, and her plum-coloured satin with pale blue side-panels, and blue ostrich plumes in a small satin bonnet, met with general approval; but before she had settled herself with a stately rustle in the pew opposite Mrs. Archer's the spectators were craning their necks to see who was coming after her. Wild rumours had been abroad the day before to the effect that Mrs. Manson Mingott, in spite of her physical disabilities, had resolved on being present at the ceremony; and the idea was so much in keeping with her sporting character that bets ran high at the clubs as to her being able to walk up the nave and squeeze into a seat. It was known that she had insisted on sending her own carpenter to look into the possibility of taking down the end panel of the front pew, and to measure the space between the seat and the front; but the result had been discouraging, and for one anxious day her family had watched her dallying with the plan of being wheeled up the nave in her enormous Bath chair and sitting enthroned in it at the foot of the chancel. The idea of this monstrous exposure of her person was so painful to her relations that they could have covered with gold the ingenious person who suddenly discovered that the chair was too wide to pass between the iron uprights of the awning which extended from the church door to the curbstone. The idea of doing away with this awning, and revealing the bride to the mob of dressmakers and newspaper reporters who stood outside fighting to get near the joints of the canvas, exceeded even old Catherine's courage, though for a moment she had weighed the possibility. ""Why, they might take a photograph of my child AND PUT IT IN THE PAPERS!"" Mrs. Welland exclaimed when her mother's last plan was hinted to her; and from this unthinkable indecency the clan recoiled with a collective shudder. The ancestress had had to give in; but her concession was bought only by the promise that the wedding- breakfast should take place under her roof, though (as the Washington Square connection said) with the Wellands' house in easy reach it was hard to have to make a special price with Brown to drive one to the other end of nowhere. Though all these transactions had been widely reported by the Jacksons a sporting minority still clung to the belief that old Catherine would appear in church, and there was a distinct lowering of the temperature when she was found to have been replaced by her daughter-in-law. Mrs. Lovell Mingott had the high colour and glassy stare induced in ladies of her age and habit by the effort of getting into a new dress; but once the disappointment occasioned by her mother-in-law's non-appearance had subsided, it was agreed that her black Chantilly over lilac satin, with a bonnet of Parma violets, formed the happiest contrast to Mrs. Welland's blue and plum-colour. Far different was the impression produced by the gaunt and mincing lady who followed on Mr. Mingott's arm, in a wild dishevelment of stripes and fringes and floating scarves; and as this last apparition glided into view Archer's heart contracted and stopped beating. He had taken it for granted that the Marchioness Manson was still in Washington, where she had gone some four weeks previously with her niece, Madame Olenska. It was generally understood that their abrupt departure was due to Madame Olenska's desire to remove her aunt from the baleful eloquence of Dr. Agathon Carver, who had nearly succeeded in enlisting her as a recruit for the Valley of Love; and in the circumstances no one had expected either of the ladies to return for the wedding. For a moment Archer stood with his eyes fixed on Medora's fantastic figure, straining to see who came behind her; but the little procession was at an end, for all the lesser members of the family had taken their seats, and the eight tall ushers, gathering themselves together like birds or insects preparing for some migratory manoeuvre, were already slipping through the side doors into the lobby. ""Newland--I say: SHE'S HERE!"" the best man whispered. Archer roused himself with a start. A long time had apparently passed since his heart had stopped beating, for the white and rosy procession was in fact half way up the nave, the Bishop, the Rector and two white-winged assistants were hovering about the flower-banked altar, and the first chords of the Spohr symphony were strewing their flower-like notes before the bride. Archer opened his eyes (but could they really have been shut, as he imagined?), and felt his heart beginning to resume its usual task. The music, the scent of the lilies on the altar, the vision of the cloud of tulle and orange-blossoms floating nearer and nearer, the sight of Mrs. Archer's face suddenly convulsed with happy sobs, the low benedictory murmur of the Rector's voice, the ordered evolutions of the eight pink bridesmaids and the eight black ushers: all these sights, sounds and sensations, so familiar in themselves, so unutterably strange and meaningless in his new relation to them, were confusedly mingled in his brain. ""My God,"" he thought, ""HAVE I got the ring?""--and once more he went through the bridegroom's convulsive gesture. Then, in a moment, May was beside him, such radiance streaming from her that it sent a faint warmth through his numbness, and he straightened himself and smiled into her eyes. ""Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here,"" the Rector began . . . The ring was on her hand, the Bishop's benediction had been given, the bridesmaids were a-poise to resume their place in the procession, and the organ was showing preliminary symptoms of breaking out into the Mendelssohn March, without which no newly-wedded couple had ever emerged upon New York. ""Your arm--I SAY, GIVE HER YOUR ARM!"" young Newland nervously hissed; and once more Archer became aware of having been adrift far off in the unknown. What was it that had sent him there, he wondered? Perhaps the glimpse, among the anonymous spectators in the transept, of a dark coil of hair under a hat which, a moment later, revealed itself as belonging to an unknown lady with a long nose, so laughably unlike the person whose image she had evoked that he asked himself if he were becoming subject to hallucinations. And now he and his wife were pacing slowly down the nave, carried forward on the light Mendelssohn ripples, the spring day beckoning to them through widely opened doors, and Mrs. Welland's chestnuts, with big white favours on their frontlets, curvetting and showing off at the far end of the canvas tunnel. The footman, who had a still bigger white favour on his lapel, wrapped May's white cloak about her, and Archer jumped into the brougham at her side. She turned to him with a triumphant smile and their hands clasped under her veil. ""Darling!"" Archer said--and suddenly the same black abyss yawned before him and he felt himself sinking into it, deeper and deeper, while his voice rambled on smoothly and cheerfully: ""Yes, of course I thought I'd lost the ring; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a bridegroom didn't go through that. But you DID keep me waiting, you know! I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen."" She surprised him by turning, in full Fifth Avenue, and flinging her arms about his neck. ""But none ever CAN happen now, can it, Newland, as long as we two are together?""  Every detail of the day had been so carefully thought out that the young couple, after the wedding-breakfast, had ample time to put on their travelling-clothes, descend the wide Mingott stairs between laughing bridesmaids and weeping parents, and get into the brougham under the traditional shower of rice and satin slippers; and there was still half an hour left in which to drive to the station, buy the last weeklies at the bookstall with the air of seasoned travellers, and settle themselves in the reserved compartment in which May's maid had already placed her dove-coloured travelling cloak and glaringly new dressing-bag from London. The old du Lac aunts at Rhinebeck had put their house at the disposal of the bridal couple, with a readiness inspired by the prospect of spending a week in New York with Mrs. Archer; and Archer, glad to escape the usual ""bridal suite"" in a Philadelphia or Baltimore hotel, had accepted with an equal alacrity. May was enchanted at the idea of going to the country, and childishly amused at the vain efforts of the eight bridesmaids to discover where their mysterious retreat was situated. It was thought ""very English"" to have a country-house lent to one, and the fact gave a last touch of distinction to what was generally conceded to be the most brilliant wedding of the year; but where the house was no one was permitted to know, except the parents of bride and groom, who, when taxed with the knowledge, pursed their lips and said mysteriously: ""Ah, they didn't tell us--"" which was manifestly true, since there was no need to. Once they were settled in their compartment, and the train, shaking off the endless wooden suburbs, had pushed out into the pale landscape of spring, talk became easier than Archer had expected. May was still, in look and tone, the simple girl of yesterday, eager to compare notes with him as to the incidents of the wedding, and discussing them as impartially as a bridesmaid talking it all over with an usher. At first Archer had fancied that this detachment was the disguise of an inward tremor; but her clear eyes revealed only the most tranquil unawareness. She was alone for the first time with her husband; but her husband was only the charming comrade of yesterday. There was no one whom she liked as much, no one whom she trusted as completely, and the culminating ""lark"" of the whole delightful adventure of engagement and marriage was to be off with him alone on a journey, like a grownup person, like a ""married woman,"" in fact. It was wonderful that--as he had learned in the Mission garden at St. Augustine--such depths of feeling could coexist with such absence of imagination. But he remembered how, even then, she had surprised him by dropping back to inexpressive girlishness as soon as her conscience had been eased of its burden; and he saw that she would probably go through life dealing to the best of her ability with each experience as it came, but never anticipating any by so much as a stolen glance. Perhaps that faculty of unawareness was what gave her eyes their transparency, and her face the look of representing a type rather than a person; as if she might have been chosen to pose for a Civic Virtue or a Greek goddess. The blood that ran so close to her fair skin might have been a preserving fluid rather than a ravaging element; yet her look of indestructible youthfulness made her seem neither hard nor dull, but only primitive and pure. In the thick of this meditation Archer suddenly felt himself looking at her with the startled gaze of a stranger, and plunged into a reminiscence of the wedding-breakfast and of Granny Mingott's immense and triumphant pervasion of it. May settled down to frank enjoyment of the subject. ""I was surprised, though--weren't you?--that aunt Medora came after all. Ellen wrote that they were neither of them well enough to take the journey; I do wish it had been she who had recovered! Did you see the exquisite old lace she sent me?"" He had known that the moment must come sooner or later, but he had somewhat imagined that by force of willing he might hold it at bay. ""Yes--I--no: yes, it was beautiful,"" he said, looking at her blindly, and wondering if, whenever he heard those two syllables, all his carefully built-up world would tumble about him like a house of cards. ""Aren't you tired? It will be good to have some tea when we arrive--I'm sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready,"" he rattled on, taking her hand in his; and her mind rushed away instantly to the magnificent tea and coffee service of Baltimore silver which the Beauforts had sent, and which ""went"" so perfectly with uncle Lovell Mingott's trays and sidedishes. In the spring twilight the train stopped at the Rhinebeck station, and they walked along the platform to the waiting carriage. ""Ah, how awfully kind of the van der Luydens-- they've sent their man over from Skuytercliff to meet us,"" Archer exclaimed, as a sedate person out of livery approached them and relieved the maid of her bags. ""I'm extremely sorry, sir,"" said this emissary, ""that a little accident has occurred at the Miss du Lacs': a leak in the water-tank. It happened yesterday, and Mr. van der Luyden, who heard of it this morning, sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the Patroon's house ready. It will be quite comfortable, I think you'll find, sir; and the Miss du Lacs have sent their cook over, so that it will be exactly the same as if you'd been at Rhinebeck."" Archer stared at the speaker so blankly that he repeated in still more apologetic accents: ""It'll be exactly the same, sir, I do assure you--"" and May's eager voice broke out, covering the embarrassed silence: ""The same as Rhinebeck? The Patroon's house? But it will be a hundred thousand times better--won't it, Newland? It's too dear and kind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it."" And as they drove off, with the maid beside the coachman, and their shining bridal bags on the seat before them, she went on excitedly: ""Only fancy, I've never been inside it--have you? The van der Luydens show it to so few people. But they opened it for Ellen, it seems, and she told me what a darling little place it was: she says it's the only house she's seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly happy in."" ""Well--that's what we're going to be, isn't it?"" cried her husband gaily; and she answered with her boyish smile: ""Ah, it's just our luck beginning--the wonderful luck we're always going to have together!""  XX. Of course we must dine with Mrs. Carfry, dearest,"" Archer said; and his wife looked at him with an anxious frown across the monumental Britannia ware of their lodging house breakfast-table. In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not ""dignified"" to force one's self on the notice of one's acquaintances in foreign countries. Mrs. Archer and Janey, in the course of their visits to Europe, had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle, and met the friendly advances of their fellow-travellers with an air of such impenetrable reserve, that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a ""foreigner"" other than those employed in hotels and railway-stations. Their own compatriots-- save those previously known or properly accredited-- they treated with an even more pronounced disdain; so that, unless they ran across a Chivers, a Dagonet or a Mingott, their months abroad were spent in an unbroken tete-a-tete. But the utmost precautions are sometimes unavailing; and one night at Botzen one of the two English ladies in the room across the passage (whose names, dress and social situation were already intimately known to Janey) had knocked on the door and asked if Mrs. Archer had a bottle of liniment. The other lady--the intruder's sister, Mrs. Carfry--had been seized with a sudden attack of bronchitis; and Mrs. Archer, who never travelled without a complete family pharmacy, was fortunately able to produce the required remedy. Mrs. Carfry was very ill, and as she and her sister Miss Harle were travelling alone they were profoundly grateful to the Archer ladies, who supplied them with ingenious comforts and whose efficient maid helped to nurse the invalid back to health. When the Archers left Botzen they had no idea of ever seeing Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle again. Nothing, to Mrs. Archer's mind, would have been more ""undignified"" than to force one's self on the notice of a ""foreigner"" to whom one had happened to render an accidental service. But Mrs. Carfry and her sister, to whom this point of view was unknown, and who would have found it utterly incomprehensible, felt themselves linked by an eternal gratitude to the ""delightful Americans"" who had been so kind at Botzen. With touching fidelity they seized every chance of meeting Mrs. Archer and Janey in the course of their continental travels, and displayed a supernatural acuteness in finding out when they were to pass through London on their way to or from the States. The intimacy became indissoluble, and Mrs. Archer and Janey, whenever they alighted at Brown's Hotel, found themselves awaited by two affectionate friends who, like themselves, cultivated ferns in Wardian cases, made macrame lace, read the memoirs of the Baroness Bunsen and had views about the occupants of the leading London pulpits. As Mrs. Archer said, it made ""another thing of London"" to know Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle; and by the time that Newland became engaged the tie between the families was so firmly established that it was thought ""only right"" to send a wedding invitation to the two English ladies, who sent, in return, a pretty bouquet of pressed Alpine flowers under glass. And on the dock, when Newland and his wife sailed for England, Mrs. Archer's last word had been: ""You must take May to see Mrs. Carfry."" Newland and his wife had had no idea of obeying this injunction; but Mrs. Carfry, with her usual acuteness, had run them down and sent them an invitation to dine; and it was over this invitation that May Archer was wrinkling her brows across the tea and muffins. ""It's all very well for you, Newland; you KNOW them. But I shall feel so shy among a lot of people I've never met. And what shall I wear?"" Newland leaned back in his chair and smiled at her. She looked handsomer and more Diana-like than ever. The moist English air seemed to have deepened the bloom of her cheeks and softened the slight hardness of her virginal features; or else it was simply the inner glow of happiness, shining through like a light under ice. ""Wear, dearest? I thought a trunkful of things had come from Paris last week."" ""Yes, of course. I meant to say that I shan't know WHICH to wear."" She pouted a little. ""I've never dined out in London; and I don't want to be ridiculous."" He tried to enter into her perplexity. ""But don't Englishwomen dress just like everybody else in the evening?"" ""Newland! How can you ask such funny questions? When they go to the theatre in old ball-dresses and bare heads."" ""Well, perhaps they wear new ball-dresses at home; but at any rate Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle won't. They'll wear caps like my mother's--and shawls; very soft shawls."" ""Yes; but how will the other women be dressed?"" ""Not as well as you, dear,"" he rejoined, wondering what had suddenly developed in her Janey's morbid interest in clothes. She pushed back her chair with a sigh. ""That's dear of you, Newland; but it doesn't help me much."" He had an inspiration. ""Why not wear your wedding- dress? That can't be wrong, can it?"" ""Oh, dearest! If I only had it here! But it's gone to Paris to be made over for next winter, and Worth hasn't sent it back."" ""Oh, well--"" said Archer, getting up. ""Look here-- the fog's lifting. If we made a dash for the National Gallery we might manage to catch a glimpse of the pictures.""  The Newland Archers were on their way home, after a three months' wedding-tour which May, in writing to her girl friends, vaguely summarised as ""blissful."" They had not gone to the Italian Lakes: on reflection, Archer had not been able to picture his wife in that particular setting. Her own inclination (after a month with the Paris dressmakers) was for mountaineering in July and swimming in August. This plan they punctually fulfilled, spending July at Interlaken and Grindelwald, and August at a little place called Etretat, on the Normandy coast, which some one had recommended as quaint and quiet. Once or twice, in the mountains, Archer had pointed southward and said: ""There's Italy""; and May, her feet in a gentian-bed, had smiled cheerfully, and replied: ""It would be lovely to go there next winter, if only you didn't have to be in New York."" But in reality travelling interested her even less than he had expected. She regarded it (once her clothes were ordered) as merely an enlarged opportunity for walking, riding, swimming, and trying her hand at the fascinating new game of lawn tennis; and when they finally got back to London (where they were to spend a fortnight while he ordered HIS clothes) she no longer concealed the eagerness with which she looked forward to sailing. In London nothing interested her but the theatres and the shops; and she found the theatres less exciting than the Paris cafes chantants where, under the blossoming horse-chestnuts of the Champs Elysees, she had had the novel experience of looking down from the restaurant terrace on an audience of ""cocottes,"" and having her husband interpret to her as much of the songs as he thought suitable for bridal ears. Archer had reverted to all his old inherited ideas about marriage. It was less trouble to conform with the tradition and treat May exactly as all his friends treated their wives than to try to put into practice the theories with which his untrammelled bachelorhood had dallied. There was no use in trying to emancipate a wife who had not the dimmest notion that she was not free; and he had long since discovered that May's only use of the liberty she supposed herself to possess would be to lay it on the altar of her wifely adoration. Her innate dignity would always keep her from making the gift abjectly; and a day might even come (as it once had) when she would find strength to take it altogether back if she thought she were doing it for his own good. But with a conception of marriage so uncomplicated and incurious as hers such a crisis could be brought about only by something visibly outrageous in his own conduct; and the fineness of her feeling for him made that unthinkable. Whatever happened, he knew, she would always be loyal, gallant and unresentful; and that pledged him to the practice of the same virtues. All this tended to draw him back into his old habits of mind. If her simplicity had been the simplicity of pettiness he would have chafed and rebelled; but since the lines of her character, though so few, were on the same fine mould as her face, she became the tutelary divinity of all his old traditions and reverences. Such qualities were scarcely of the kind to enliven foreign travel, though they made her so easy and pleasant a companion; but he saw at once how they would fall into place in their proper setting. He had no fear of being oppressed by them, for his artistic and intellectual life would go on, as it always had, outside the domestic circle; and within it there would be nothing small and stifling--coming back to his wife would never be like entering a stuffy room after a tramp in the open. And when they had children the vacant corners in both their lives would be filled. All these things went through his mind during their long slow drive from Mayfair to South Kensington, where Mrs. Carfry and her sister lived. Archer too would have preferred to escape their friends' hospitality: in conformity with the family tradition he had always travelled as a sight-seer and looker-on, affecting a haughty unconsciousness of the presence of his fellow- beings. Once only, just after Harvard, he had spent a few gay weeks at Florence with a band of queer Europeanised Americans, dancing all night with titled ladies in palaces, and gambling half the day with the rakes and dandies of the fashionable club; but it had all seemed to him, though the greatest fun in the world, as unreal as a carnival. These queer cosmopolitan women, deep in complicated love-affairs which they appeared to feel the need of retailing to every one they met, and the magnificent young officers and elderly dyed wits who were the subjects or the recipients of their confidences, were too different from the people Archer had grown up among, too much like expensive and rather malodorous hot-house exotics, to detain his imagination long. To introduce his wife into such a society was out of the question; and in the course of his travels no other had shown any marked eagerness for his company. Not long after their arrival in London he had run across the Duke of St. Austrey, and the Duke, instantly and cordially recognising him, had said: ""Look me up, won't you?""--but no proper-spirited American would have considered that a suggestion to be acted on, and the meeting was without a sequel. They had even managed to avoid May's English aunt, the banker's wife, who was still in Yorkshire; in fact, they had purposely postponed going to London till the autumn in order that their arrival during the season might not appear pushing and snobbish to these unknown relatives. ""Probably there'll be nobody at Mrs. Carfry's--London's a desert at this season, and you've made yourself much too beautiful,"" Archer said to May, who sat at his side in the hansom so spotlessly splendid in her sky-blue cloak edged with swansdown that it seemed wicked to expose her to the London grime. ""I don't want them to think that we dress like savages,"" she replied, with a scorn that Pocahontas might have resented; and he was struck again by the religious reverence of even the most unworldly American women for the social advantages of dress. ""It's their armour,"" he thought, ""their defence against the unknown, and their defiance of it."" And he understood for the first time the earnestness with which May, who was incapable of tying a ribbon in her hair to charm him, had gone through the solemn rite of selecting and ordering her extensive wardrobe. He had been right in expecting the party at Mrs. Carfry's to be a small one. Besides their hostess and her sister, they found, in the long chilly drawing-room, only another shawled lady, a genial Vicar who was her husband, a silent lad whom Mrs. Carfry named as her nephew, and a small dark gentleman with lively eyes whom she introduced as his tutor, pronouncing a French name as she did so. Into this dimly-lit and dim-featured group May Archer floated like a swan with the sunset on her: she seemed larger, fairer, more voluminously rustling than her husband had ever seen her; and he perceived that the rosiness and rustlingness were the tokens of an extreme and infantile shyness. ""What on earth will they expect me to talk about?"" her helpless eyes implored him, at the very moment that her dazzling apparition was calling forth the same anxiety in their own bosoms. But beauty, even when distrustful of itself, awakens confidence in the manly heart; and the Vicar and the French-named tutor were soon manifesting to May their desire to put her at her ease. In spite of their best efforts, however, the dinner was a languishing affair. Archer noticed that his wife's way of showing herself at her ease with foreigners was to become more uncompromisingly local in her references, so that, though her loveliness was an encouragement to admiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee. The Vicar soon abandoned the struggle; but the tutor, who spoke the most fluent and accomplished English, gallantly continued to pour it out to her until the ladies, to the manifest relief of all concerned, went up to the drawing-room. The Vicar, after a glass of port, was obliged to hurry away to a meeting, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was packed off to bed. But Archer and the tutor continued to sit over their wine, and suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his last symposium with Ned Winsett. The Carfry nephew, it turned out, had been threatened with consumption, and had had to leave Harrow for Switzerland, where he had spent two years in the milder air of Lake Leman. Being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to M. Riviere, who had brought him back to England, and was to remain with him till he went up to Oxford the following spring; and M. Riviere added with simplicity that he should then have to look out for another job. It seemed impossible, Archer thought, that he should be long without one, so varied were his interests and so many his gifts. He was a man of about thirty, with a thin ugly face (May would certainly have called him common-looking) to which the play of his ideas gave an intense expressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his animation. His father, who had died young, had filled a small diplomatic post, and it had been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an insatiable taste for letters had thrown the young man into journalism, then into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and at length--after other experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into tutoring English youths in Switzerland. Before that, however, he had lived much in Paris, frequented the Goncourt grenier, been advised by Maupassant not to attempt to write (even that seemed to Archer a dazzling honour!), and had often talked with Merimee in his mother's house. He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious (having a mother and an unmarried sister to provide for), and it was apparent that his literary ambitions had failed. His situation, in fact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than Ned Winsett's; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, no one who loved ideas need hunger mentally. As it was precisely of that love that poor Winsett was starving to death, Archer looked with a sort of vicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so richly in his poverty. ""You see, Monsieur, it's worth everything, isn't it, to keep one's intellectual liberty, not to enslave one's powers of appreciation, one's critical independence? It was because of that that I abandoned journalism, and took to so much duller work: tutoring and private secretaryship. There is a good deal of drudgery, of course; but one preserves one's moral freedom, what we call in French one's quant a soi. And when one hears good talk one can join in it without compromising any opinions but one's own; or one can listen, and answer it inwardly. Ah, good conversation--there's nothing like it, is there? The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing. And so I have never regretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism--two different forms of the same self-abdication."" He fixed his vivid eyes on Archer as he lit another cigarette. ""Voyez-vous, Monsieur, to be able to look life in the face: that's worth living in a garret for, isn't it? But, after all, one must earn enough to pay for the garret; and I confess that to grow old as a private tutor--or a `private' anything--is almost as chilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at Bucharest. Sometimes I feel I must make a plunge: an immense plunge. Do you suppose, for instance, there would be any opening for me in America-- in New York?"" Archer looked at him with startled eyes. New York, for a young man who had frequented the Goncourts and Flaubert, and who thought the life of ideas the only one worth living! He continued to stare at M. Riviere perplexedly, wondering how to tell him that his very superiorities and advantages would be the surest hindrance to success. ""New York--New York--but must it be especially New York?"" he stammered, utterly unable to imagine what lucrative opening his native city could offer to a young man to whom good conversation appeared to be the only necessity. A sudden flush rose under M. Riviere's sallow skin. ""I--I thought it your metropolis: is not the intellectual life more active there?"" he rejoined; then, as if fearing to give his hearer the impression of having asked a favour, he went on hastily: ""One throws out random suggestions--more to one's self than to others. In reality, I see no immediate prospect--"" and rising from his seat he added, without a trace of constraint: ""But Mrs. Carfry will think that I ought to be taking you upstairs."" During the homeward drive Archer pondered deeply on this episode. His hour with M. Riviere had put new air into his lungs, and his first impulse had been to invite him to dine the next day; but he was beginning to understand why married men did not always immediately yield to their first impulses. ""That young tutor is an interesting fellow: we had some awfully good talk after dinner about books and things,"" he threw out tentatively in the hansom. May roused herself from one of the dreamy silences into which he had read so many meanings before six months of marriage had given him the key to them. ""The little Frenchman? Wasn't he dreadfully common?"" she questioned coldly; and he guessed that she nursed a secret disappointment at having been invited out in London to meet a clergyman and a French tutor. The disappointment was not occasioned by the sentiment ordinarily defined as snobbishness, but by old New York's sense of what was due to it when it risked its dignity in foreign lands. If May's parents had entertained the Carfrys in Fifth Avenue they would have offered them something more substantial than a parson and a schoolmaster. But Archer was on edge, and took her up. ""Common--common WHERE?"" he queried; and she returned with unusual readiness: ""Why, I should say anywhere but in his school-room. Those people are always awkward in society. But then,"" she added disarmingly, ""I suppose I shouldn't have known if he was clever."" Archer disliked her use of the word ""clever"" almost as much as her use of the word ""common""; but he was beginning to fear his tendency to dwell on the things he disliked in her. After all, her point of view had always been the same. It was that of all the people he had grown up among, and he had always regarded it as necessary but negligible. Until a few months ago he had never known a ""nice"" woman who looked at life differently; and if a man married it must necessarily be among the nice. ""Ah--then I won't ask him to dine!"" he concluded with a laugh; and May echoed, bewildered: ""Goodness-- ask the Carfrys' tutor?"" ""Well, not on the same day with the Carfrys, if you prefer I shouldn't. But I did rather want another talk with him. He's looking for a job in New York."" Her surprise increased with her indifference: he almost fancied that she suspected him of being tainted with ""foreignness."" ""A job in New York? What sort of a job? People don't have French tutors: what does he want to do?"" ""Chiefly to enjoy good conversation, I understand,"" her husband retorted perversely; and she broke into an appreciative laugh. ""Oh, Newland, how funny! Isn't that FRENCH?"" On the whole, he was glad to have the matter settled for him by her refusing to take seriously his wish to invite M. Riviere. Another after-dinner talk would have made it difficult to avoid the question of New York; and the more Archer considered it the less he was able to fit M. Riviere into any conceivable picture of New York as he knew it. He perceived with a flash of chilling insight that in future many problems would be thus negatively solved for him; but as he paid the hansom and followed his wife's long train into the house he took refuge in the comforting platitude that the first six months were always the most difficult in marriage. ""After that I suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each other's angles,"" he reflected; but the worst of it was that May's pressure was already bearing on the very angles whose sharpness he most wanted to keep.  XXI. The small bright lawn stretched away smoothly to the big bright sea. The turf was hemmed with an edge of scarlet geranium and coleus, and cast-iron vases painted in chocolate colour, standing at intervals along the winding path that led to the sea, looped their garlands of petunia and ivy geranium above the neatly raked gravel. Half way between the edge of the cliff and the square wooden house (which was also chocolate-coloured, but with the tin roof of the verandah striped in yellow and brown to represent an awning) two large targets had been placed against a background of shrubbery. On the other side of the lawn, facing the targets, was pitched a real tent, with benches and garden-seats about it. A number of ladies in summer dresses and gentlemen in grey frock-coats and tall hats stood on the lawn or sat upon the benches; and every now and then a slender girl in starched muslin would step from the tent, bow in hand, and speed her shaft at one of the targets, while the spectators interrupted their talk to watch the result. Newland Archer, standing on the verandah of the house, looked curiously down upon this scene. On each side of the shiny painted steps was a large blue china flower-pot on a bright yellow china stand. A spiky green plant filled each pot, and below the verandah ran a wide border of blue hydrangeas edged with more red geraniums. Behind him, the French windows of the drawing-rooms through which he had passed gave glimpses, between swaying lace curtains, of glassy parquet floors islanded with chintz poufs, dwarf armchairs, and velvet tables covered with trifles in silver. The Newport Archery Club always held its August meeting at the Beauforts'. The sport, which had hitherto known no rival but croquet, was beginning to be discarded in favour of lawn-tennis; but the latter game was still considered too rough and inelegant for social occasions, and as an opportunity to show off pretty dresses and graceful attitudes the bow and arrow held their own. Archer looked down with wonder at the familiar spectacle. It surprised him that life should be going on in the old way when his own reactions to it had so completely changed. It was Newport that had first brought home to him the extent of the change. In New York, during the previous winter, after he and May had settled down in the new greenish-yellow house with the bow-window and the Pompeian vestibule, he had dropped back with relief into the old routine of the office, and the renewal of this daily activity had served as a link with his former self. Then there had been the pleasurable excitement of choosing a showy grey stepper for May's brougham (the Wellands had given the carriage), and the abiding occupation and interest of arranging his new library, which, in spite of family doubts and disapprovals, had been carried out as he had dreamed, with a dark embossed paper, Eastlake book-cases and ""sincere"" arm-chairs and tables. At the Century he had found Winsett again, and at the Knickerbocker the fashionable young men of his own set; and what with the hours dedicated to the law and those given to dining out or entertaining friends at home, with an occasional evening at the Opera or the play, the life he was living had still seemed a fairly real and inevitable sort of business. But Newport represented the escape from duty into an atmosphere of unmitigated holiday-making. Archer had tried to persuade May to spend the summer on a remote island off the coast of Maine (called, appropriately enough, Mount Desert), where a few hardy Bostonians and Philadelphians were camping in ""native"" cottages, and whence came reports of enchanting scenery and a wild, almost trapper-like existence amid woods and waters. But the Wellands always went to Newport, where they owned one of the square boxes on the cliffs, and their son-in-law could adduce no good reason why he and May should not join them there. As Mrs. Welland rather tartly pointed out, it was hardly worth while for May to have worn herself out trying on summer clothes in Paris if she was not to be allowed to wear them; and this argument was of a kind to which Archer had as yet found no answer. May herself could not understand his obscure reluctance to fall in with so reasonable and pleasant a way of spending the summer. She reminded him that he had always liked Newport in his bachelor days, and as this was indisputable he could only profess that he was sure he was going to like it better than ever now that they were to be there together. But as he stood on the Beaufort verandah and looked out on the brightly peopled lawn it came home to him with a shiver that he was not going to like it at all. It was not May's fault, poor dear. If, now and then, during their travels, they had fallen slightly out of step, harmony had been restored by their return to the conditions she was used to. He had always foreseen that she would not disappoint him; and he had been right. He had married (as most young men did) because he had met a perfectly charming girl at the moment when a series of rather aimless sentimental adventures were ending in premature disgust; and she had represented peace, stability, comradeship, and the steadying sense of an unescapable duty. He could not say that he had been mistaken in his choice, for she had fulfilled all that he had expected. It was undoubtedly gratifying to be the husband of one of the handsomest and most popular young married women in New York, especially when she was also one of the sweetest-tempered and most reasonable of wives; and Archer had never been insensible to such advantages. As for the momentary madness which had fallen upon him on the eve of his marriage, he had trained himself to regard it as the last of his discarded experiments. The idea that he could ever, in his senses, have dreamed of marrying the Countess Olenska had become almost unthinkable, and she remained in his memory simply as the most plaintive and poignant of a line of ghosts. But all these abstractions and eliminations made of his mind a rather empty and echoing place, and he supposed that was one of the reasons why the busy animated people on the Beaufort lawn shocked him as if they had been children playing in a grave-yard. He heard a murmur of skirts beside him, and the Marchioness Manson fluttered out of the drawing-room window. As usual, she was extraordinarily festooned and bedizened, with a limp Leghorn hat anchored to her head by many windings of faded gauze, and a little black velvet parasol on a carved ivory handle absurdly balanced over her much larger hatbrim. ""My dear Newland, I had no idea that you and May had arrived! You yourself came only yesterday, you say? Ah, business--business--professional duties . . . I understand. Many husbands, I know, find it impossible to join their wives here except for the week-end."" She cocked her head on one side and languished at him through screwed-up eyes. ""But marriage is one long sacrifice, as I used often to remind my Ellen--"" Archer's heart stopped with the queer jerk which it had given once before, and which seemed suddenly to slam a door between himself and the outer world; but this break of continuity must have been of the briefest, for he presently heard Medora answering a question he had apparently found voice to put. ""No, I am not staying here, but with the Blenkers, in their delicious solitude at Portsmouth. Beaufort was kind enough to send his famous trotters for me this morning, so that I might have at least a glimpse of one of Regina's garden-parties; but this evening I go back to rural life. The Blenkers, dear original beings, have hired a primitive old farm-house at Portsmouth where they gather about them representative people . . ."" She drooped slightly beneath her protecting brim, and added with a faint blush: ""This week Dr. Agathon Carver is holding a series of Inner Thought meetings there. A contrast indeed to this gay scene of worldly pleasure-- but then I have always lived on contrasts! To me the only death is monotony. I always say to Ellen: Beware of monotony; it's the mother of all the deadly sins. But my poor child is going through a phase of exaltation, of abhorrence of the world. You know, I suppose, that she has declined all invitations to stay at Newport, even with her grandmother Mingott? I could hardly persuade her to come with me to the Blenkers', if you will believe it! The life she leads is morbid, unnatural. Ah, if she had only listened to me when it was still possible . . . When the door was still open . . . But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match? I hear your May is one of the competitors."" Strolling toward them from the tent Beaufort advanced over the lawn, tall, heavy, too tightly buttoned into a London frock-coat, with one of his own orchids in its buttonhole. Archer, who had not seen him for two or three months, was struck by the change in his appearance. In the hot summer light his floridness seemed heavy and bloated, and but for his erect square- shouldered walk he would have looked like an over-fed and over-dressed old man. There were all sorts of rumours afloat about Beaufort. In the spring he had gone off on a long cruise to the West Indies in his new steam-yacht, and it was reported that, at various points where he had touched, a lady resembling Miss Fanny Ring had been seen in his company. The steam-yacht, built in the Clyde, and fitted with tiled bath-rooms and other unheard-of luxuries, was said to have cost him half a million; and the pearl necklace which he had presented to his wife on his return was as magnificent as such expiatory offerings are apt to be. Beaufort's fortune was substantial enough to stand the strain; and yet the disquieting rumours persisted, not only in Fifth Avenue but in Wall Street. Some people said he had speculated unfortunately in railways, others that he was being bled by one of the most insatiable members of her profession; and to every report of threatened insolvency Beaufort replied by a fresh extravagance: the building of a new row of orchid-houses, the purchase of a new string of race-horses, or the addition of a new Meissonnier or Cabanel to his picture-gallery. He advanced toward the Marchioness and Newland with his usual half-sneering smile. ""Hullo, Medora! Did the trotters do their business? Forty minutes, eh? . . . Well, that's not so bad, considering your nerves had to be spared."" He shook hands with Archer, and then, turning back with them, placed himself on Mrs. Manson's other side, and said, in a low voice, a few words which their companion did not catch. The Marchioness replied by one of her queer foreign jerks, and a ""Que voulez-vous?"" which deepened Beaufort's frown; but he produced a good semblance of a congratulatory smile as he glanced at Archer to say: ""You know May's going to carry off the first prize."" ""Ah, then it remains in the family,"" Medora rippled; and at that moment they reached the tent and Mrs. Beaufort met them in a girlish cloud of mauve muslin and floating veils. May Welland was just coming out of the tent. In her white dress, with a pale green ribbon about the waist and a wreath of ivy on her hat, she had the same Diana-like aloofness as when she had entered the Beaufort ball-room on the night of her engagement. In the interval not a thought seemed to have passed behind her eyes or a feeling through her heart; and though her husband knew that she had the capacity for both he marvelled afresh at the way in which experience dropped away from her. She had her bow and arrow in her hand, and placing herself on the chalk-mark traced on the turf she lifted the bow to her shoulder and took aim. The attitude was so full of a classic grace that a murmur of appreciation followed her appearance, and Archer felt the glow of proprietorship that so often cheated him into Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton momentary well-being. Her rivals--Mrs. Reggie Chivers, the Merry girls, and divers rosy Thorleys, Dagonets and Mingotts, stood behind her in a lovely anxious group, brown heads and golden bent above the scores, and pale muslins and flower-wreathed hats mingled in a tender rainbow. All were young and pretty, and bathed in summer bloom; but not one had the nymph- like ease of his wife, when, with tense muscles and happy frown, she bent her soul upon some feat of strength. ""Gad,"" Archer heard Lawrence Lefferts say, ""not one of the lot holds the bow as she does""; and Beaufort retorted: ""Yes; but that's the only kind of target she'll ever hit."" Archer felt irrationally angry. His host's contemptuous tribute to May's ""niceness"" was just what a husband should have wished to hear said of his wife. The fact that a coarseminded man found her lacking in attraction was simply another proof of her quality; yet the words sent a faint shiver through his heart. What if ""niceness"" carried to that supreme degree were only a negation, the curtain dropped before an emptiness? As he looked at May, returning flushed and calm from her final bull's-eye, he had the feeling that he had never yet lifted that curtain. She took the congratulations of her rivals and of the rest of the company with the simplicity that was her crowning grace. No one could ever be jealous of her triumphs because she managed to give the feeling that she would have been just as serene if she had missed them. But when her eyes met her husband's her face glowed with the pleasure she saw in his. Mrs. Welland's basket-work pony-carriage was waiting for them, and they drove off among the dispersing carriages, May handling the reins and Archer sitting at her side. The afternoon sunlight still lingered upon the bright lawns and shrubberies, and up and down Bellevue Avenue rolled a double line of victorias, dog-carts, landaus and ""vis-a-vis,"" carrying well-dressed ladies and gentlemen away from the Beaufort garden-party, or homeward from their daily afternoon turn along the Ocean Drive. ""Shall we go to see Granny?"" May suddenly proposed. ""I should like to tell her myself that I've won the prize. There's lots of time before dinner."" Archer acquiesced, and she turned the ponies down Narragansett Avenue, crossed Spring Street and drove out toward the rocky moorland beyond. In this unfashionable region Catherine the Great, always indifferent to precedent and thrifty of purse, had built herself in her youth a many-peaked and cross-beamed cottage- orne on a bit of cheap land overlooking the bay. Here, in a thicket of stunted oaks, her verandahs spread themselves above the island-dotted waters. A winding drive led up between iron stags and blue glass balls embedded in mounds of geraniums to a front door of highly-varnished walnut under a striped verandah-roof; and behind it ran a narrow hall with a black and yellow star-patterned parquet floor, upon which opened four small square rooms with heavy flock-papers under ceilings on which an Italian house-painter had lavished all the divinities of Olympus. One of these rooms had been turned into a bedroom by Mrs. Mingott when the burden of flesh descended on her, and in the adjoining one she spent her days, enthroned in a large armchair between the open door and window, and perpetually waving a palm-leaf fan which the prodigious projection of her bosom kept so far from the rest of her person that the air it set in motion stirred only the fringe of the anti-macassars on the chair-arms. Since she had been the means of hastening his marriage old Catherine had shown to Archer the cordiality which a service rendered excites toward the person served. She was persuaded that irrepressible passion was the cause of his impatience; and being an ardent admirer of impulsiveness (when it did not lead to the spending of money) she always received him with a genial twinkle of complicity and a play of allusion to which May seemed fortunately impervious. She examined and appraised with much interest the diamond-tipped arrow which had been pinned on May's bosom at the conclusion of the match, remarking that in her day a filigree brooch would have been thought enough, but that there was no denying that Beaufort did things handsomely. ""Quite an heirloom, in fact, my dear,"" the old lady chuckled. ""You must leave it in fee to your eldest girl."" She pinched May's white arm and watched the colour flood her face. ""Well, well, what have I said to make you shake out the red flag? Ain't there going to be any daughters--only boys, eh? Good gracious, look at her blushing again all over her blushes! What--can't I say that either? Mercy me--when my children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out overhead I always say I'm too thankful to have somebody about me that NOTHING can shock!"" Archer burst into a laugh, and May echoed it, crimson to the eyes. ""Well, now tell me all about the party, please, my dears, for I shall never get a straight word about it out of that silly Medora,"" the ancestress continued; and, as May exclaimed: ""Cousin Medora? But I thought she was going back to Portsmouth?"" she answered placidly: ""So she is--but she's got to come here first to pick up Ellen. Ah--you didn't know Ellen had come to spend the day with me? Such fol-de-rol, her not coming for the summer; but I gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago. Ellen--ELLEN!"" she cried in her shrill old voice, trying to bend forward far enough to catch a glimpse of the lawn beyond the verandah. There was no answer, and Mrs. Mingott rapped impatiently with her stick on the shiny floor. A mulatto maid-servant in a bright turban, replying to the summons, informed her mistress that she had seen ""Miss Ellen"" going down the path to the shore; and Mrs. Mingott turned to Archer. ""Run down and fetch her, like a good grandson; this pretty lady will describe the party to me,"" she said; and Archer stood up as if in a dream. He had heard the Countess Olenska's name pronounced often enough during the year and a half since they had last met, and was even familiar with the main incidents of her life in the interval. He knew that she had spent the previous summer at Newport, where she appeared to have gone a great deal into society, but that in the autumn she had suddenly sub-let the ""perfect house"" which Beaufort had been at such pains to find for her, and decided to establish herself in Washington. There, during the winter, he had heard of her (as one always heard of pretty women in Washington) as shining in the ""brilliant diplomatic society"" that was supposed to make up for the social short-comings of the Administration. He had listened to these accounts, and to various contradictory reports on her appearance, her conversation, her point of view and her choice of friends, with the detachment with which one listens to reminiscences of some one long since dead; not till Medora suddenly spoke her name at the archery match had Ellen Olenska become a living presence to him again. The Marchioness's foolish lisp had called up a vision of the little fire-lit drawing-room and the sound of the carriage-wheels returning down the deserted street. He thought of a story he had read, of some peasant children in Tuscany lighting a bunch of straw in a wayside cavern, and revealing old silent images in their painted tomb . . . The way to the shore descended from the bank on which the house was perched to a walk above the water planted with weeping willows. Through their veil Archer caught the glint of the Lime Rock, with its white-washed turret and the tiny house in which the heroic light-house keeper, Ida Lewis, was living her last venerable years. Beyond it lay the flat reaches and ugly government chimneys of Goat Island, the bay spreading northward in a shimmer of gold to Prudence Island with its low growth of oaks, and the shores of Conanicut faint in the sunset haze. From the willow walk projected a slight wooden pier ending in a sort of pagoda-like summer-house; and in the pagoda a lady stood, leaning against the rail, her back to the shore. Archer stopped at the sight as if he had waked from sleep. That vision of the past was a dream, and the reality was what awaited him in the house on the bank overhead: was Mrs. Welland's pony- carriage circling around and around the oval at the door, was May sitting under the shameless Olympians and glowing with secret hopes, was the Welland villa at the far end of Bellevue Avenue, and Mr. Welland, already dressed for dinner, and pacing the drawing- room floor, watch in hand, with dyspeptic impatience-- for it was one of the houses in which one always knew exactly what is happening at a given hour. ""What am I? A son-in-law--"" Archer thought. The figure at the end of the pier had not moved. For a long moment the young man stood half way down the bank, gazing at the bay furrowed with the coming and going of sailboats, yacht-launches, fishing-craft and the trailing black coal-barges hauled by noisy tugs. The lady in the summer-house seemed to be held by the same sight. Beyond the grey bastions of Fort Adams a long-drawn sunset was splintering up into a thousand fires, and the radiance caught the sail of a catboat as it beat out through the channel between the Lime Rock and the shore. Archer, as he watched, remembered the scene in the Shaughraun, and Montague lifting Ada Dyas's ribbon to his lips without her knowing that he was in the room. ""She doesn't know--she hasn't guessed. Shouldn't I know if she came up behind me, I wonder?"" he mused; and suddenly he said to himself: ""If she doesn't turn before that sail crosses the Lime Rock light I'll go back."" The boat was gliding out on the receding tide. It slid before the Lime Rock, blotted out Ida Lewis's little house, and passed across the turret in which the light was hung. Archer waited till a wide space of water sparkled between the last reef of the island and the stern of the boat; but still the figure in the summer- house did not move. He turned and walked up the hill.  ""I'm sorry you didn't find Ellen--I should have liked to see her again,"" May said as they drove home through the dusk. ""But perhaps she wouldn't have cared--she seems so changed."" ""Changed?"" echoed her husband in a colourless voice, his eyes fixed on the ponies' twitching ears. ""So indifferent to her friends, I mean; giving up New York and her house, and spending her time with such queer people. Fancy how hideously uncomfortable she must be at the Blenkers'! She says she does it to keep cousin Medora out of mischief: to prevent her marrying dreadful people. But I sometimes think we've always bored her."" Archer made no answer, and she continued, with a tinge of hardness that he had never before noticed in her frank fresh voice: ""After all, I wonder if she wouldn't be happier with her husband."" He burst into a laugh. ""Sancta simplicitas!"" he exclaimed; and as she turned a puzzled frown on him he added: ""I don't think I ever heard you say a cruel thing before."" ""Cruel?"" ""Well--watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a favourite sport of the angels; but I believe even they don't think people happier in hell."" ""It's a pity she ever married abroad then,"" said May, in the placid tone with which her mother met Mr. Welland's vagaries; and Archer felt himself gently relegated to the category of unreasonable husbands. They drove down Bellevue Avenue and turned in between the chamfered wooden gate-posts surmounted by cast-iron lamps which marked the approach to the Welland villa. Lights were already shining through its windows, and Archer, as the carriage stopped, caught a glimpse of his father-in-law, exactly as he had pictured him, pacing the drawing-room, watch in hand and wearing the pained expression that he had long since found to be much more efficacious than anger. The young man, as he followed his wife into the hall, was conscious of a curious reversal of mood. There was something about the luxury of the Welland house and the density of the Welland atmosphere, so charged with minute observances and exactions, that always stole into his system like a narcotic. The heavy carpets, the watchful servants, the perpetually reminding tick of disciplined clocks, the perpetually renewed stack of cards and invitations on the hall table, the whole chain of tyrannical trifles binding one hour to the next, and each member of the household to all the others, made any less systematised and affluent existence seem unreal and precarious. But now it was the Welland house, and the life he was expected to lead in it, that had become unreal and irrelevant, and the brief scene on the shore, when he had stood irresolute, halfway down the bank, was as close to him as the blood in his veins. All night he lay awake in the big chintz bedroom at May's side, watching the moonlight slant along the carpet, and thinking of Ellen Olenska driving home across the gleaming beaches behind Beaufort's trotters.  XXII. A party for the Blenkers--the Blenkers?"" Mr. Welland laid down his knife and fork and looked anxiously and incredulously across the luncheon- table at his wife, who, adjusting her gold eye-glasses, read aloud, in the tone of high comedy: ""Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Welland's company at the meeting of the Wednesday Afternoon Club on August 25th at 3 o'clock punctually. To meet Mrs. and the Misses Blenker. ""Red Gables, Catherine Street.   R. S. V. P."" ""Good gracious--"" Mr. Welland gasped, as if a second reading had been necessary to bring the monstrous absurdity of the thing home to him. ""Poor Amy Sillerton--you never can tell what her husband will do next,"" Mrs. Welland sighed. ""I suppose he's just discovered the Blenkers."" Professor Emerson Sillerton was a thorn in the side of Newport society; and a thorn that could not be plucked out, for it grew on a venerable and venerated family tree. He was, as people said, a man who had had ""every advantage."" His father was Sillerton Jackson's uncle, his mother a Pennilow of Boston; on each side there was wealth and position, and mutual suitability. Nothing--as Mrs. Welland had often remarked-- nothing on earth obliged Emerson Sillerton to be an archaeologist, or indeed a Professor of any sort, or to live in Newport in winter, or do any of the other revolutionary things that he did. But at least, if he was going to break with tradition and flout society in the face, he need not have married poor Amy Dagonet, who had a right to expect ""something different,"" and money enough to keep her own carriage. No one in the Mingott set could understand why Amy Sillerton had submitted so tamely to the eccentricities of a husband who filled the house with long- haired men and short-haired women, and, when he travelled, took her to explore tombs in Yucatan instead of going to Paris or Italy. But there they were, set in their ways, and apparently unaware that they were different from other people; and when they gave one of their dreary annual garden-parties every family on the Cliffs, because of the Sillerton-Pennilow-Dagonet connection, had to draw lots and send an unwilling representative. ""It's a wonder,"" Mrs. Welland remarked, ""that they didn't choose the Cup Race day! Do you remember, two years ago, their giving a party for a black man on the day of Julia Mingott's the dansant? Luckily this time there's nothing else going on that I know of--for of course some of us will have to go."" Mr. Welland sighed nervously. ""`Some of us,' my dear--more than one? Three o'clock is such a very awkward hour. I have to be here at half-past three to take my drops: it's really no use trying to follow Bencomb's new treatment if I don't do it systematically; and if I join you later, of course I shall miss my drive."" At the thought he laid down his knife and fork again, and a flush of anxiety rose to his finely-wrinkled cheek. ""There's no reason why you should go at all, my dear,"" his wife answered with a cheerfulness that had become automatic. ""I have some cards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue, and I'll drop in at about half-past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that she hasn't been slighted."" She glanced hesitatingly at her daughter. ""And if Newland's afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you out with the ponies, and try their new russet harness."" It was a principle in the Welland family that people's days and hours should be what Mrs. Welland called ""provided for."" The melancholy possibility of having to ""kill time"" (especially for those who did not care for whist or solitaire) was a vision that haunted her as the spectre of the unemployed haunts the philanthropist. Another of her principles was that parents should never (at least visibly) interfere with the plans of their married children; and the difficulty of adjusting this respect for May's independence with the exigency of Mr. Welland's claims could be overcome only by the exercise of an ingenuity which left not a second of Mrs. Welland's own time unprovided for. ""Of course I'll drive with Papa--I'm sure Newland will find something to do,"" May said, in a tone that gently reminded her husband of his lack of response. It was a cause of constant distress to Mrs. Welland that her son-in-law showed so little foresight in planning his days. Often already, during the fortnight that he had passed under her roof, when she enquired how he meant to spend his afternoon, he had answered paradoxically: ""Oh, I think for a change I'll just save it instead of spending it--"" and once, when she and May had had to go on a long-postponed round of afternoon calls, he had confessed to having lain all the afternoon under a rock on the beach below the house. ""Newland never seems to look ahead,"" Mrs. Welland once ventured to complain to her daughter; and May answered serenely: ""No; but you see it doesn't matter, because when there's nothing particular to do he reads a book."" ""Ah, yes--like his father!"" Mrs. Welland agreed, as if allowing for an inherited oddity; and after that the question of Newland's unemployment was tacitly dropped. Nevertheless, as the day for the Sillerton reception approached, May began to show a natural solicitude for his welfare, and to suggest a tennis match at the Chiverses', or a sail on Julius Beaufort's cutter, as a means of atoning for her temporary desertion. ""I shall be back by six, you know, dear: Papa never drives later than that--"" and she was not reassured till Archer said that he thought of hiring a run-about and driving up the island to a stud-farm to look at a second horse for her brougham. They had been looking for this horse for some time, and the suggestion was so acceptable that May glanced at her mother as if to say: ""You see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of us."" The idea of the stud-farm and the brougham horse had germinated in Archer's mind on the very day when the Emerson Sillerton invitation had first been mentioned; but he had kept it to himself as if there were something clandestine in the plan, and discovery might prevent its execution. He had, however, taken the precaution to engage in advance a runabout with a pair of old livery-stable trotters that could still do their eighteen miles on level roads; and at two o'clock, hastily deserting the luncheon-table, he sprang into the light carriage and drove off. The day was perfect. A breeze from the north drove little puffs of white cloud across an ultramarine sky, with a bright sea running under it. Bellevue Avenue was empty at that hour, and after dropping the stable- lad at the corner of Mill Street Archer turned down the Old Beach Road and drove across Eastman's Beach. He had the feeling of unexplained excitement with which, on half-holidays at school, he used to start off into the unknown. Taking his pair at an easy gait, he counted on reaching the stud-farm, which was not far beyond Paradise Rocks, before three o'clock; so that, after looking over the horse (and trying him if he seemed promising) he would still have four golden hours to dispose of. As soon as he heard of the Sillerton's party he had said to himself that the Marchioness Manson would certainly come to Newport with the Blenkers, and that Madame Olenska might again take the opportunity of spending the day with her grandmother. At any rate, the Blenker habitation would probably be deserted, and he would be able, without indiscretion, to satisfy a vague curiosity concerning it. He was not sure that he wanted to see the Countess Olenska again; but ever since he had looked at her from the path above the bay he had wanted, irrationally and indescribably, to see the place she was living in, and to follow the movements of her imagined figure as he had watched the real one in the summer-house. The longing was with him day and night, an incessant undefinable craving, like the sudden whim of a sick man for food or drink once tasted and long since forgotten. He could not see beyond the craving, or picture what it might lead to, for he was not conscious of any wish to speak to Madame Olenska or to hear her voice. He simply felt that if he could carry away the vision of the spot of earth she walked on, and the way the sky and sea enclosed it, the rest of the world might seem less empty. When he reached the stud-farm a glance showed him that the horse was not what he wanted; nevertheless he took a turn behind it in order to prove to himself that he was not in a hurry. But at three o'clock he shook out the reins over the trotters and turned into the by-roads leading to Portsmouth. The wind had dropped and a faint haze on the horizon showed that a fog was waiting to steal up the Saconnet on the turn of the tide; but all about him fields and woods were steeped in golden light. He drove past grey-shingled farm-houses in orchards, past hay-fields and groves of oak, past villages with white steeples rising sharply into the fading sky; and at last, after stopping to ask the way of some men at work in a field, he turned down a lane between high banks of goldenrod and brambles. At the end of the lane was the blue glimmer of the river; to the left, standing in front of a clump of oaks and maples, he saw a long tumble-down house with white paint peeling from its clapboards. On the road-side facing the gateway stood one of the open sheds in which the New Englander shelters his farming implements and visitors ""hitch"" their ""teams."" Archer, jumping down, led his pair into the shed, and after tying them to a post turned toward the house. The patch of lawn before it had relapsed into a hay- field; but to the left an overgrown box-garden full of dahlias and rusty rose-bushes encircled a ghostly summer- house of trellis-work that had once been white, surmounted by a wooden Cupid who had lost his bow and arrow but continued to take ineffectual aim. Archer leaned for a while against the gate. No one was in sight, and not a sound came from the open windows of the house: a grizzled Newfoundland dozing before the door seemed as ineffectual a guardian as the arrowless Cupid. It was strange to think that this place of silence and decay was the home of the turbulent Blenkers; yet Archer was sure that he was not mistaken. For a long time he stood there, content to take in the scene, and gradually falling under its drowsy spell; but at length he roused himself to the sense of the passing time. Should he look his fill and then drive away? He stood irresolute, wishing suddenly to see the inside of the house, so that he might picture the room that Madame Olenska sat in. There was nothing to prevent his walking up to the door and ringing the bell; if, as he supposed, she was away with the rest of the party, he could easily give his name, and ask permission to go into the sitting-room to write a message. But instead, he crossed the lawn and turned toward the box-garden. As he entered it he caught sight of something bright-coloured in the summer-house, and presently made it out to be a pink parasol. The parasol drew him like a magnet: he was sure it was hers. He went into the summer-house, and sitting down on the rickety seat picked up the silken thing and looked at its carved handle, which was made of some rare wood that gave out an aromatic scent. Archer lifted the handle to his lips. He heard a rustle of skirts against the box, and sat motionless, leaning on the parasol handle with clasped hands, and letting the rustle come nearer without lifting his eyes. He had always known that this must happen . . . ""Oh, Mr. Archer!"" exclaimed a loud young voice; and looking up he saw before him the youngest and largest of the Blenker girls, blonde and blowsy, in bedraggled muslin. A red blotch on one of her cheeks seemed to show that it had recently been pressed against a pillow, and her half-awakened eyes stared at him hospitably but confusedly. ""Gracious--where did you drop from? I must have been sound asleep in the hammock. Everybody else has gone to Newport. Did you ring?"" she incoherently enquired. Archer's confusion was greater than hers. ""I--no-- that is, I was just going to. I had to come up the island to see about a horse, and I drove over on a chance of finding Mrs. Blenker and your visitors. But the house seemed empty--so I sat down to wait."" Miss Blenker, shaking off the fumes of sleep, looked at him with increasing interest. ""The house IS empty. Mother's not here, or the Marchioness--or anybody but me."" Her glance became faintly reproachful. ""Didn't you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are giving a garden-party for mother and all of us this afternoon? It was too unlucky that I couldn't go; but I've had a sore throat, and mother was afraid of the drive home this evening. Did you ever know anything so disappointing? Of course,"" she added gaily, ""I shouldn't have minded half as much if I'd known you were coming."" Symptoms of a lumbering coquetry became visible in her, and Archer found the strength to break in: ""But Madame Olenska--has she gone to Newport too?"" Miss Blenker looked at him with surprise. ""Madame Olenska--didn't you know she'd been called away?"" ""Called away?--"" ""Oh, my best parasol! I lent it to that goose of a Katie, because it matched her ribbons, and the careless thing must have dropped it here. We Blenkers are all like that . . . real Bohemians!"" Recovering the sunshade with a powerful hand she unfurled it and suspended its rosy dome above her head. ""Yes, Ellen was called away yesterday: she lets us call her Ellen, you know. A telegram came from Boston: she said she might be gone for two days. I do LOVE the way she does her hair, don't you?"" Miss Blenker rambled on. Archer continued to stare through her as though she had been transparent. All he saw was the trumpery parasol that arched its pinkness above her giggling head. After a moment he ventured: ""You don't happen to know why Madame Olenska went to Boston? I hope it was not on account of bad news?"" Miss Blenker took this with a cheerful incredulity. ""Oh, I don't believe so. She didn't tell us what was in the telegram. I think she didn't want the Marchioness to know. She's so romantic-looking, isn't she? Doesn't she remind you of Mrs. Scott-Siddons when she reads `Lady Geraldine's Courtship'? Did you never hear her?"" Archer was dealing hurriedly with crowding thoughts. His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen. He glanced about him at the unpruned garden, the tumble-down house, and the oak- grove under which the dusk was gathering. It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to have found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink sunshade was not hers . . . He frowned and hesitated. ""You don't know, I suppose-- I shall be in Boston tomorrow. If I could manage to see her--"" He felt that Miss Blenker was losing interest in him, though her smile persisted. ""Oh, of course; how lovely of you! She's staying at the Parker House; it must be horrible there in this weather."" After that Archer was but intermittently aware of the remarks they exchanged. He could only remember stoutly resisting her entreaty that he should await the returning family and have high tea with them before he drove home. At length, with his hostess still at his side, he passed out of range of the wooden Cupid, unfastened his horses and drove off. At the turn of the lane he saw Miss Blenker standing at the gate and waving the pink parasol.  XXIII. The next morning, when Archer got out of the Fall River train, he emerged upon a steaming midsummer Boston. The streets near the station were full of the smell of beer and coffee and decaying fruit and a shirt- sleeved populace moved through them with the intimate abandon of boarders going down the passage to the bathroom. Archer found a cab and drove to the Somerset Club for breakfast. Even the fashionable quarters had the air of untidy domesticity to which no excess of heat ever degrades the European cities. Care-takers in calico lounged on the door-steps of the wealthy, and the Common looked like a pleasure-ground on the morrow of a Masonic picnic. If Archer had tried to imagine Ellen Olenska in improbable scenes he could not have called up any into which it was more difficult to fit her than this heat-prostrated and deserted Boston. He breakfasted with appetite and method, beginning with a slice of melon, and studying a morning paper while he waited for his toast and scrambled eggs. A new sense of energy and activity had possessed him ever since he had announced to May the night before that he had business in Boston, and should take the Fall River boat that night and go on to New York the following evening. It had always been understood that he would return to town early in the week, and when he got back from his expedition to Portsmouth a letter from the office, which fate had conspicuously placed on a corner of the hall table, sufficed to justify his sudden change of plan. He was even ashamed of the ease with which the whole thing had been done: it reminded him, for an uncomfortable moment, of Lawrence Lefferts's masterly contrivances for securing his freedom. But this did not long trouble him, for he was not in an analytic mood. After breakfast he smoked a cigarette and glanced over the Commercial Advertiser. While he was thus engaged two or three men he knew came in, and the usual greetings were exchanged: it was the same world after all, though he had such a queer sense of having slipped through the meshes of time and space. He looked at his watch, and finding that it was half-past nine got up and went into the writing-room. There he wrote a few lines, and ordered a messenger to take a cab to the Parker House and wait for the answer. He then sat down behind another newspaper and tried to calculate how long it would take a cab to get to the Parker House. ""The lady was out, sir,"" he suddenly heard a waiter's voice at his elbow; and he stammered: ""Out?--"" as if it were a word in a strange language. He got up and went into the hall. It must be a mistake: she could not be out at that hour. He flushed with anger at his own stupidity: why had he not sent the note as soon as he arrived? He found his hat and stick and went forth into the street. The city had suddenly become as strange and vast and empty as if he were a traveller from distant lands. For a moment he stood on the door-step hesitating; then he decided to go to the Parker House. What if the messenger had been misinformed, and she were still there? He started to walk across the Common; and on the first bench, under a tree, he saw her sitting. She had a grey silk sunshade over her head--how could he ever have imagined her with a pink one? As he approached he was struck by her listless attitude: she sat there as if she had nothing else to do. He saw her drooping profile, and the knot of hair fastened low in the neck under her dark hat, and the long wrinkled glove on the hand that held the sunshade. He came a step or two nearer, and she turned and looked at him. ""Oh""--she said; and for the first time he noticed a startled look on her face; but in another moment it gave way to a slow smile of wonder and contentment. ""Oh""--she murmured again, on a different note, as he stood looking down at her; and without rising she made a place for him on the bench. ""I'm here on business--just got here,"" Archer explained; and, without knowing why, he suddenly began to feign astonishment at seeing her. ""But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness?"" He had really no idea what he was saying: he felt as if he were shouting at her across endless distances, and she might vanish again before he could overtake her. ""I? Oh, I'm here on business too,"" she answered, turning her head toward him so that they were face to face. The words hardly reached him: he was aware only of her voice, and of the startling fact that not an echo of it had remained in his memory. He had not even remembered that it was low-pitched, with a faint roughness on the consonants. ""You do your hair differently,"" he said, his heart beating as if he had uttered something irrevocable. ""Differently? No--it's only that I do it as best I can when I'm without Nastasia."" ""Nastasia; but isn't she with you?"" ""No; I'm alone. For two days it was not worth while to bring her."" ""You're alone--at the Parker House?"" She looked at him with a flash of her old malice. ""Does it strike you as dangerous?"" ""No; not dangerous--"" ""But unconventional? I see; I suppose it is."" She considered a moment. ""I hadn't thought of it, because I've just done something so much more unconventional."" The faint tinge of irony lingered in her eyes. ""I've just refused to take back a sum of money--that belonged to me."" Archer sprang up and moved a step or two away. She had furled her parasol and sat absently drawing patterns on the gravel. Presently he came back and stood before her. ""Some one--has come here to meet you?"" ""Yes."" ""With this offer?"" She nodded. ""And you refused--because of the conditions?"" ""I refused,"" she said after a moment. He sat down by her again. ""What were the conditions?"" ""Oh, they were not onerous: just to sit at the head of his table now and then."" There was another interval of silence. Archer's heart had slammed itself shut in the queer way it had, and he sat vainly groping for a word. ""He wants you back--at any price?"" ""Well--a considerable price. At least the sum is considerable for me."" He paused again, beating about the question he felt he must put. ""It was to meet him here that you came?"" She stared, and then burst into a laugh. ""Meet him--my husband? HERE? At this season he's always at Cowes or Baden."" ""He sent some one?"" ""Yes."" ""With a letter?"" She shook her head. ""No; just a message. He never writes. I don't think I've had more than one letter from him."" The allusion brought the colour to her cheek, and it reflected itself in Archer's vivid blush. ""Why does he never write?"" ""Why should he? What does one have secretaries for?"" The young man's blush deepened. She had pronounced the word as if it had no more significance than any other in her vocabulary. For a moment it was on the tip of his tongue to ask: ""Did he send his secretary, then?"" But the remembrance of Count Olenski's only letter to his wife was too present to him. He paused again, and then took another plunge. ""And the person?""-- ""The emissary? The emissary,"" Madame Olenska rejoined, still smiling, ""might, for all I care, have left already; but he has insisted on waiting till this evening . . . in case . . . on the chance . . ."" ""And you came out here to think the chance over?"" ""I came out to get a breath of air. The hotel's too stifling. I'm taking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth."" They sat silent, not looking at each other, but straight ahead at the people passing along the path. Finally she turned her eyes again to his face and said: ""You're not changed."" He felt like answering: ""I was, till I saw you again;"" but instead he stood up abruptly and glanced about him at the untidy sweltering park. ""This is horrible. Why shouldn't we go out a little on the bay? There's a breeze, and it will be cooler. We might take the steamboat down to Point Arley."" She glanced up at him hesitatingly and he went on: ""On a Monday morning there won't be anybody on the boat. My train doesn't leave till evening: I'm going back to New York. Why shouldn't we?"" he insisted, looking down at her; and suddenly he broke out: ""Haven't we done all we could?"" ""Oh""--she murmured again. She stood up and reopened her sunshade, glancing about her as if to take counsel of the scene, and assure herself of the impossibility of remaining in it. Then her eyes returned to his face. ""You mustn't say things like that to me,"" she said. ""I'll say anything you like; or nothing. I won't open my mouth unless you tell me to. What harm can it do to anybody? All I want is to listen to you,"" he stammered. She drew out a little gold-faced watch on an enamelled chain. ""Oh, don't calculate,"" he broke out; ""give me the day! I want to get you away from that man. At what time was he coming?"" Her colour rose again. ""At eleven."" ""Then you must come at once."" ""You needn't be afraid--if I don't come."" ""Nor you either--if you do. I swear I only want to hear about you, to know what you've been doing. It's a hundred years since we've met--it may be another hundred before we meet again."" She still wavered, her anxious eyes on his face. ""Why didn't you come down to the beach to fetch me, the day I was at Granny's?"" she asked. ""Because you didn't look round--because you didn't know I was there. I swore I wouldn't unless you looked round."" He laughed as the childishness of the confession struck him. ""But I didn't look round on purpose."" ""On purpose?"" ""I knew you were there; when you drove in I recognised the ponies. So I went down to the beach."" ""To get away from me as far as you could?"" She repeated in a low voice: ""To get away from you as far as I could."" He laughed out again, this time in boyish satisfaction. ""Well, you see it's no use. I may as well tell you,"" he added, ""that the business I came here for was just to find you. But, look here, we must start or we shall miss our boat."" ""Our boat?"" She frowned perplexedly, and then smiled. ""Oh, but I must go back to the hotel first: I must leave a note--"" ""As many notes as you please. You can write here."" He drew out a note-case and one of the new stylographic pens. ""I've even got an envelope--you see how everything's predestined! There--steady the thing on your knee, and I'll get the pen going in a second. They have to be humoured; wait--"" He banged the hand that held the pen against the back of the bench. ""It's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer: just a trick. Now try--"" She laughed, and bending over the sheet of paper which he had laid on his note-case, began to write. Archer walked away a few steps, staring with radiant unseeing eyes at the passersby, who, in their turn, paused to stare at the unwonted sight of a fashionably- dressed lady writing a note on her knee on a bench in the Common. Madame Olenska slipped the sheet into the envelope, wrote a name on it, and put it into her pocket. Then she too stood up. They walked back toward Beacon Street, and near the club Archer caught sight of the plush-lined ""herdic"" which had carried his note to the Parker House, and whose driver was reposing from this effort by bathing his brow at the corner hydrant. ""I told you everything was predestined! Here's a cab for us. You see!"" They laughed, astonished at the miracle of picking up a public conveyance at that hour, and in that unlikely spot, in a city where cab-stands were still a ""foreign"" novelty. Archer, looking at his watch, saw that there was time to drive to the Parker House before going to the steamboat landing. They rattled through the hot streets and drew up at the door of the hotel. Archer held out his hand for the letter. ""Shall I take it in?"" he asked; but Madame Olenska, shaking her head, sprang out and disappeared through the glazed doors. It was barely half-past ten; but what if the emissary, impatient for her reply, and not knowing how else to employ his time, were already seated among the travellers with cooling drinks at their elbows of whom Archer had caught a glimpse as she went in? He waited, pacing up and down before the herdic. A Sicilian youth with eyes like Nastasia's offered to shine his boots, and an Irish matron to sell him peaches; and every few moments the doors opened to let out hot men with straw hats tilted far back, who glanced at him as they went by. He marvelled that the door should open so often, and that all the people it let out should look so like each other, and so like all the other hot men who, at that hour, through the length and breadth of the land, were passing continuously in and out of the swinging doors of hotels. And then, suddenly, came a face that he could not relate to the other faces. He caught but a flash of it, for his pacings had carried him to the farthest point of his beat, and it was in turning back to the hotel that he saw, in a group of typical countenances--the lank and weary, the round and surprised, the lantern-jawed and mild--this other face that was so many more things at once, and things so different. It was that of a young man, pale too, and half-extinguished by the heat, or worry, or both, but somehow, quicker, vivider, more conscious; or perhaps seeming so because he was so different. Archer hung a moment on a thin thread of memory, but it snapped and floated off with the disappearing face--apparently that of some foreign business man, looking doubly foreign in such a setting. He vanished in the stream of passersby, and Archer resumed his patrol. He did not care to be seen watch in hand within view of the hotel, and his unaided reckoning of the lapse of time led him to conclude that, if Madame Olenska was so long in reappearing, it could only be because she had met the emissary and been waylaid by him. At the thought Archer's apprehension rose to anguish. ""If she doesn't come soon I'll go in and find her,"" he said. The doors swung open again and she was at his side. They got into the herdic, and as it drove off he took out his watch and saw that she had been absent just three minutes. In the clatter of loose windows that made talk impossible they bumped over the disjointed cobblestones to the wharf.  Seated side by side on a bench of the half-empty boat they found that they had hardly anything to say to each other, or rather that what they had to say communicated itself best in the blessed silence of their release and their isolation. As the paddle-wheels began to turn, and wharves and shipping to recede through the veil of heat, it seemed to Archer that everything in the old familiar world of habit was receding also. He longed to ask Madame Olenska if she did not have the same feeling: the feeling that they were starting on some long voyage from which they might never return. But he was afraid to say it, or anything else that might disturb the delicate balance of her trust in him. In reality he had no wish to betray that trust. There had been days and nights when the memory of their kiss had burned and burned on his lips; the day before even, on the drive to Portsmouth, the thought of her had run through him like fire; but now that she was beside him, and they were drifting forth into this unknown world, they seemed to have reached the kind of deeper nearness that a touch may sunder. As the boat left the harbour and turned seaward a breeze stirred about them and the bay broke up into long oily undulations, then into ripples tipped with spray. The fog of sultriness still hung over the city, but ahead lay a fresh world of ruffled waters, and distant promontories with light-houses in the sun. Madame Olenska, leaning back against the boat-rail, drank in the coolness between parted lips. She had wound a long veil about her hat, but it left her face uncovered, and Archer was struck by the tranquil gaiety of her expression. She seemed to take their adventure as a matter of course, and to be neither in fear of unexpected encounters, nor (what was worse) unduly elated by their possibility. In the bare dining-room of the inn, which he had hoped they would have to themselves, they found a strident party of innocent-looking young men and women--school-teachers on a holiday, the landlord told them--and Archer's heart sank at the idea of having to talk through their noise. ""This is hopeless--I'll ask for a private room,"" he said; and Madame Olenska, without offering any objection, waited while he went in search of it. The room opened on a long wooden verandah, with the sea coming in at the windows. It was bare and cool, with a table covered with a coarse checkered cloth and adorned by a bottle of pickles and a blueberry pie under a cage. No more guileless-looking cabinet particulier ever offered its shelter to a clandestine couple: Archer fancied he saw the sense of its reassurance in the faintly amused smile with which Madame Olenska sat down opposite to him. A woman who had run away from her husband-- and reputedly with another man--was likely to have mastered the art of taking things for granted; but something in the quality of her composure took the edge from his irony. By being so quiet, so unsurprised and so simple she had managed to brush away the conventions and make him feel that to seek to be alone was the natural thing for two old friends who had so much to say to each other. . . .  XXIV. They lunched slowly and meditatively, with mute intervals between rushes of talk; for, the spell once broken, they had much to say, and yet moments when saying became the mere accompaniment to long duologues of silence. Archer kept the talk from his own affairs, not with conscious intention but because he did not want to miss a word of her history; and leaning on the table, her chin resting on her clasped hands, she talked to him of the year and a half since they had met. She had grown tired of what people called ""society""; New York was kind, it was almost oppressively hospitable; she should never forget the way in which it had welcomed her back; but after the first flush of novelty she had found herself, as she phrased it, too ""different"" to care for the things it cared about--and so she had decided to try Washington, where one was supposed to meet more varieties of people and of opinion. And on the whole she should probably settle down in Washington, and make a home there for poor Medora, who had worn out the patience of all her other relations just at the time when she most needed looking after and protecting from matrimonial perils. ""But Dr. Carver--aren't you afraid of Dr. Carver? I hear he's been staying with you at the Blenkers'."" She smiled. ""Oh, the Carver danger is over. Dr. Carver is a very clever man. He wants a rich wife to finance his plans, and Medora is simply a good advertisement as a convert."" ""A convert to what?"" ""To all sorts of new and crazy social schemes. But, do you know, they interest me more than the blind conformity to tradition--somebody else's tradition--that I see among our own friends. It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country."" She smiled across the table. ""Do you suppose Christopher Columbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the Opera with the Selfridge Merrys?"" Archer changed colour. ""And Beaufort--do you say these things to Beaufort?"" he asked abruptly. ""I haven't seen him for a long time. But I used to; and he understands."" ""Ah, it's what I've always told you; you don't like us. And you like Beaufort because he's so unlike us."" He looked about the bare room and out at the bare beach and the row of stark white village houses strung along the shore. ""We're damnably dull. We've no character, no colour, no variety.--I wonder,"" he broke out, ""why you don't go back?"" Her eyes darkened, and he expected an indignant rejoinder. But she sat silent, as if thinking over what he had said, and he grew frightened lest she should answer that she wondered too. At length she said: ""I believe it's because of you."" It was impossible to make the confession more dispassionately, or in a tone less encouraging to the vanity of the person addressed. Archer reddened to the temples, but dared not move or speak: it was as if her words had been some rare butterfly that the least motion might drive off on startled wings, but that might gather a flock about it if it were left undisturbed. ""At least,"" she continued, ""it was you who made me understand that under the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate that even those I most cared for in my other life look cheap in comparison. I don't know how to explain myself""--she drew together her troubled brows-- ""but it seems as if I'd never before understood with how much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures may be paid."" ""Exquisite pleasures--it's something to have had them!"" he felt like retorting; but the appeal in her eyes kept him silent. ""I want,"" she went on, ""to be perfectly honest with you--and with myself. For a long time I've hoped this chance would come: that I might tell you how you've helped me, what you've made of me--"" Archer sat staring beneath frowning brows. He interrupted her with a laugh. ""And what do you make out that you've made of me?"" She paled a little. ""Of you?"" ""Yes: for I'm of your making much more than you ever were of mine. I'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to."" Her paleness turned to a fugitive flush. ""I thought-- you promised--you were not to say such things today."" ""Ah--how like a woman! None of you will ever see a bad business through!"" She lowered her voice. ""IS it a bad business--for May?"" He stood in the window, drumming against the raised sash, and feeling in every fibre the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousin's name. ""For that's the thing we've always got to think of-- haven't we--by your own showing?"" she insisted. ""My own showing?"" he echoed, his blank eyes still on the sea. ""Or if not,"" she continued, pursuing her own thought with a painful application, ""if it's not worth while to have given up, to have missed things, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and misery--then everything I came home for, everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of them--all these things are a sham or a dream--"" He turned around without moving from his place. ""And in that case there's no reason on earth why you shouldn't go back?"" he concluded for her. Her eyes were clinging to him desperately. ""Oh, IS there no reason?"" ""Not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage. My marriage,"" he said savagely, ""isn't going to be a sight to keep you here."" She made no answer, and he went on: ""What's the use? You gave me my first glimpse of a real life, and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one. It's beyond human enduring--that's all."" ""Oh, don't say that; when I'm enduring it!"" she burst out, her eyes filling. Her arms had dropped along the table, and she sat with her face abandoned to his gaze as if in the recklessness of a desperate peril. The face exposed her as much as if it had been her whole person, with the soul behind it: Archer stood dumb, overwhelmed by what it suddenly told him. ""You too--oh, all this time, you too?"" For answer, she let the tears on her lids overflow and run slowly downward. Half the width of the room was still between them, and neither made any show of moving. Archer was conscious of a curious indifference to her bodily presence: he would hardly have been aware of it if one of the hands she had flung out on the table had not drawn his gaze as on the occasion when, in the little Twenty- third Street house, he had kept his eye on it in order not to look at her face. Now his imagination spun about the hand as about the edge of a vortex; but still he made no effort to draw nearer. He had known the love that is fed on caresses and feeds them; but this passion that was closer than his bones was not to be superficially satisfied. His one terror was to do anything which might efface the sound and impression of her words; his one thought, that he should never again feel quite alone. But after a moment the sense of waste and ruin overcame him. There they were, close together and safe and shut in; yet so chained to their separate destinies that they might as well have been half the world apart. ""What's the use--when you will go back?"" he broke out, a great hopeless HOW ON EARTH CAN I KEEP YOU? crying out to her beneath his words. She sat motionless, with lowered lids. ""Oh--I shan't go yet!"" ""Not yet? Some time, then? Some time that you already foresee?"" At that she raised her clearest eyes. ""I promise you: not as long as you hold out. Not as long as we can look straight at each other like this."" He dropped into his chair. What her answer really said was: ""If you lift a finger you'll drive me back: back to all the abominations you know of, and all the temptations you half guess."" He understood it as clearly as if she had uttered the words, and the thought kept him anchored to his side of the table in a kind of moved and sacred submission. ""What a life for you!--"" he groaned. ""Oh--as long as it's a part of yours."" ""And mine a part of yours?"" She nodded. ""And that's to be all--for either of us?"" ""Well; it IS all, isn't it?"" At that he sprang up, forgetting everything but the sweetness of her face. She rose too, not as if to meet him or to flee from him, but quietly, as though the worst of the task were done and she had only to wait; so quietly that, as he came close, her outstretched hands acted not as a check but as a guide to him. They fell into his, while her arms, extended but not rigid, kept him far enough off to let her surrendered face say the rest. They may have stood in that way for a long time, or only for a few moments; but it was long enough for her silence to communicate all she had to say, and for him to feel that only one thing mattered. He must do nothing to make this meeting their last; he must leave their future in her care, asking only that she should keep fast hold of it. ""Don't--don't be unhappy,"" she said, with a break in her voice, as she drew her hands away; and he answered: ""You won't go back--you won't go back?"" as if it were the one possibility he could not bear. ""I won't go back,"" she said; and turning away she opened the door and led the way into the public dining-room. The strident school-teachers were gathering up their possessions preparatory to a straggling flight to the wharf; across the beach lay the white steam-boat at the pier; and over the sunlit waters Boston loomed in a line of haze.  XXV. Once more on the boat, and in the presence of others, Archer felt a tranquillity of spirit that surprised as much as it sustained him. The day, according to any current valuation, had been a rather ridiculous failure; he had not so much as touched Madame Olenska's hand with his lips, or extracted one word from her that gave promise of farther opportunities. Nevertheless, for a man sick with unsatisfied love, and parting for an indefinite period from the object of his passion, he felt himself almost humiliatingly calm and comforted. It was the perfect balance she had held between their loyalty to others and their honesty to themselves that had so stirred and yet tranquillized him; a balance not artfully calculated, as her tears and her falterings showed, but resulting naturally from her unabashed sincerity. It filled him with a tender awe, now the danger was over, and made him thank the fates that no personal vanity, no sense of playing a part before sophisticated witnesses, had tempted him to tempt her. Even after they had clasped hands for good-bye at the Fall River station, and he had turned away alone, the conviction remained with him of having saved out of their meeting much more than he had sacrificed. He wandered back to the club, and went and sat alone in the deserted library, turning and turning over in his thoughts every separate second of their hours together. It was clear to him, and it grew more clear under closer scrutiny, that if she should finally decide on returning to Europe--returning to her husband--it would not be because her old life tempted her, even on the new terms offered. No: she would go only if she felt herself becoming a temptation to Archer, a temptation to fall away from the standard they had both set up. Her choice would be to stay near him as long as he did not ask her to come nearer; and it depended on himself to keep her just there, safe but secluded. In the train these thoughts were still with him. They enclosed him in a kind of golden haze, through which the faces about him looked remote and indistinct: he had a feeling that if he spoke to his fellow-travellers they would not understand what he was saying. In this state of abstraction he found himself, the following morning, waking to the reality of a stifling September day in New York. The heat-withered faces in the long train streamed past him, and he continued to stare at them through the same golden blur; but suddenly, as he left the station, one of the faces detached itself, came closer and forced itself upon his consciousness. It was, as he instantly recalled, the face of the young man he had seen, the day before, passing out of the Parker House, and had noted as not conforming to type, as not having an American hotel face. The same thing struck him now; and again he became aware of a dim stir of former associations. The young man stood looking about him with the dazed air of the foreigner flung upon the harsh mercies of American travel; then he advanced toward Archer, lifted his hat, and said in English: ""Surely, Monsieur, we met in London?"" ""Ah, to be sure: in London!"" Archer grasped his hand with curiosity and sympathy. ""So you DID get here, after all?"" he exclaimed, casting a wondering eye on the astute and haggard little countenance of young Carfry's French tutor. ""Oh, I got here--yes,"" M. Riviere smiled with drawn lips. ""But not for long; I return the day after tomorrow."" He stood grasping his light valise in one neatly gloved hand, and gazing anxiously, perplexedly, almost appealingly, into Archer's face. ""I wonder, Monsieur, since I've had the good luck to run across you, if I might--"" ""I was just going to suggest it: come to luncheon, won't you? Down town, I mean: if you'll look me up in my office I'll take you to a very decent restaurant in that quarter."" M. Riviere was visibly touched and surprised. ""You're too kind. But I was only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of conveyance. There are no porters, and no one here seems to listen--"" ""I know: our American stations must surprise you. When you ask for a porter they give you chewing-gum. But if you'll come along I'll extricate you; and you must really lunch with me, you know."" The young man, after a just perceptible hesitation, replied, with profuse thanks, and in a tone that did not carry complete conviction, that he was already engaged; but when they had reached the comparative reassurance of the street he asked if he might call that afternoon. Archer, at ease in the midsummer leisure of the office, fixed an hour and scribbled his address, which the Frenchman pocketed with reiterated thanks and a wide flourish of his hat. A horse-car received him, and Archer walked away. Punctually at the hour M. Riviere appeared, shaved, smoothed-out, but still unmistakably drawn and serious. Archer was alone in his office, and the young man, before accepting the seat he proffered, began abruptly: ""I believe I saw you, sir, yesterday in Boston."" The statement was insignificant enough, and Archer was about to frame an assent when his words were checked by something mysterious yet illuminating in his visitor's insistent gaze. ""It is extraordinary, very extraordinary,"" M. Riviere continued, ""that we should have met in the circumstances in which I find myself."" ""What circumstances?"" Archer asked, wondering a little crudely if he needed money. M. Riviere continued to study him with tentative eyes. ""I have come, not to look for employment, as I spoke of doing when we last met, but on a special mission--"" ""Ah--!"" Archer exclaimed. In a flash the two meetings had connected themselves in his mind. He paused to take in the situation thus suddenly lighted up for him, and M. Riviere also remained silent, as if aware that what he had said was enough. ""A special mission,"" Archer at length repeated. The young Frenchman, opening his palms, raised them slightly, and the two men continued to look at each other across the office-desk till Archer roused himself to say: ""Do sit down""; whereupon M. Riviere bowed, took a distant chair, and again waited. ""It was about this mission that you wanted to consult me?"" Archer finally asked. M. Riviere bent his head. ""Not in my own behalf: on that score I--I have fully dealt with myself. I should like--if I may--to speak to you about the Countess Olenska."" Archer had known for the last few minutes that the words were coming; but when they came they sent the blood rushing to his temples as if he had been caught by a bent-back branch in a thicket. ""And on whose behalf,"" he said, ""do you wish to do this?"" M. Riviere met the question sturdily. ""Well--I might say HERS, if it did not sound like a liberty. Shall I say instead: on behalf of abstract justice?"" Archer considered him ironically. ""In other words: you are Count Olenski's messenger?"" He saw his blush more darkly reflected in M. Riviere's sallow countenance. ""Not to YOU, Monsieur. If I come to you, it is on quite other grounds."" ""What right have you, in the circumstances, to BE on any other ground?"" Archer retorted. ""If you're an emissary you're an emissary."" The young man considered. ""My mission is over: as far as the Countess Olenska goes, it has failed."" ""I can't help that,"" Archer rejoined on the same note of irony. ""No: but you can help--"" M. Riviere paused, turned his hat about in his still carefully gloved hands, looked into its lining and then back at Archer's face. ""You can help, Monsieur, I am convinced, to make it equally a failure with her family."" Archer pushed back his chair and stood up. ""Well-- and by God I will!"" he exclaimed. He stood with his hands in his pockets, staring down wrathfully at the little Frenchman, whose face, though he too had risen, was still an inch or two below the line of Archer's eyes. M. Riviere paled to his normal hue: paler than that his complexion could hardly turn. ""Why the devil,"" Archer explosively continued, ""should you have thought--since I suppose you're appealing to me on the ground of my relationship to Madame Olenska--that I should take a view contrary to the rest of her family?"" The change of expression in M. Riviere's face was for a time his only answer. His look passed from timidity to absolute distress: for a young man of his usually resourceful mien it would have been difficult to appear more disarmed and defenceless. ""Oh, Monsieur--"" ""I can't imagine,"" Archer continued, ""why you should have come to me when there are others so much nearer to the Countess; still less why you thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you were sent over with."" M. Riviere took this onslaught with a disconcerting humility. ""The arguments I want to present to you, Monsieur, are my own and not those I was sent over with."" ""Then I see still less reason for listening to them."" M. Riviere again looked into his hat, as if considering whether these last words were not a sufficiently broad hint to put it on and be gone. Then he spoke with sudden decision. ""Monsieur--will you tell me one thing? Is it my right to be here that you question? Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed?"" His quiet insistence made Archer feel the clumsiness of his own bluster. M. Riviere had succeeded in imposing himself: Archer, reddening slightly, dropped into his chair again, and signed to the young man to be seated. ""I beg your pardon: but why isn't the matter closed?"" M. Riviere gazed back at him with anguish. ""You do, then, agree with the rest of the family that, in face of the new proposals I have brought, it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her husband?"" ""Good God!"" Archer exclaimed; and his visitor gave out a low murmur of confirmation. ""Before seeing her, I saw--at Count Olenski's request--Mr. Lovell Mingott, with whom I had several talks before going to Boston. I understand that he represents his mother's view; and that Mrs. Manson Mingott's influence is great throughout her family."" Archer sat silent, with the sense of clinging to the edge of a sliding precipice. The discovery that he had been excluded from a share in these negotiations, and even from the knowledge that they were on foot, caused him a surprise hardly dulled by the acuter wonder of what he was learning. He saw in a flash that if the family had ceased to consult him it was because some deep tribal instinct warned them that he was no longer on their side; and he recalled, with a start of comprehension, a remark of May's during their drive home from Mrs. Manson Mingott's on the day of the Archery Meeting: ""Perhaps, after all, Ellen would be happier with her husband."" Even in the tumult of new discoveries Archer remembered his indignant exclamation, and the fact that since then his wife had never named Madame Olenska to him. Her careless allusion had no doubt been the straw held up to see which way the wind blew; the result had been reported to the family, and thereafter Archer had been tacitly omitted from their counsels. He admired the tribal discipline which made May bow to this decision. She would not have done so, he knew, had her conscience protested; but she probably shared the family view that Madame Olenska would be better off as an unhappy wife than as a separated one, and that there was no use in discussing the case with Newland, who had an awkward way of suddenly not seeming to take the most fundamental things for granted. Archer looked up and met his visitor's anxious gaze. ""Don't you know, Monsieur--is it possible you don't know--that the family begin to doubt if they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband's last proposals?"" ""The proposals you brought?"" ""The proposals I brought."" It was on Archer's lips to exclaim that whatever he knew or did not know was no concern of M. Riviere's; but something in the humble and yet courageous tenacity of M. Riviere's gaze made him reject this conclusion, and he met the young man's question with another. ""What is your object in speaking to me of this?"" He had not to wait a moment for the answer. ""To beg you, Monsieur--to beg you with all the force I'm capable of--not to let her go back.--Oh, don't let her!"" M. Riviere exclaimed. Archer looked at him with increasing astonishment. There was no mistaking the sincerity of his distress or the strength of his determination: he had evidently resolved to let everything go by the board but the supreme need of thus putting himself on record. Archer considered. ""May I ask,"" he said at length, ""if this is the line you took with the Countess Olenska?"" M. Riviere reddened, but his eyes did not falter. ""No, Monsieur: I accepted my mission in good faith. I really believed--for reasons I need not trouble you with--that it would be better for Madame Olenska to recover her situation, her fortune, the social consideration that her husband's standing gives her."" ""So I supposed: you could hardly have accepted such a mission otherwise."" ""I should not have accepted it."" ""Well, then--?"" Archer paused again, and their eyes met in another protracted scrutiny. ""Ah, Monsieur, after I had seen her, after I had listened to her, I knew she was better off here."" ""You knew--?"" ""Monsieur, I discharged my mission faithfully: I put the Count's arguments, I stated his offers, without adding any comment of my own. The Countess was good enough to listen patiently; she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice; she considered impartially all I had come to say. And it was in the course of these two talks that I changed my mind, that I came to see things differently."" ""May I ask what led to this change?"" ""Simply seeing the change in HER,"" M. Riviere replied. ""The change in her? Then you knew her before?"" The young man's colour again rose. ""I used to see her in her husband's house. I have known Count Olenski for many years. You can imagine that he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission."" Archer's gaze, wandering away to the blank walls of the office, rested on a hanging calendar surmounted by the rugged features of the President of the United States. That such a conversation should be going on anywhere within the millions of square miles subject to his rule seemed as strange as anything that the imagination could invent. ""The change--what sort of a change?"" ""Ah, Monsieur, if I could tell you!"" M. Riviere paused. ""Tenez--the discovery, I suppose, of what I'd never thought of before: that she's an American. And that if you're an American of HER kind--of your kind--things that are accepted in certain other societies, or at least put up with as part of a general convenient give-and- take--become unthinkable, simply unthinkable. If Madame Olenska's relations understood what these things were, their opposition to her returning would no doubt be as unconditional as her own; but they seem to regard her husband's wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing for domestic life."" M. Riviere paused, and then added: ""Whereas it's far from being as simple as that."" Archer looked back to the President of the United States, and then down at his desk and at the papers scattered on it. For a second or two he could not trust himself to speak. During this interval he heard M. Riviere's chair pushed back, and was aware that the young man had risen. When he glanced up again he saw that his visitor was as moved as himself. ""Thank you,"" Archer said simply. ""There's nothing to thank me for, Monsieur: it is I, rather--"" M. Riviere broke off, as if speech for him too were difficult. ""I should like, though,"" he continued in a firmer voice, ""to add one thing. You asked me if I was in Count Olenski's employ. I am at this moment: I returned to him, a few months ago, for reasons of private necessity such as may happen to any one who has persons, ill and older persons, dependent on him. But from the moment that I have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged, and I shall tell him so on my return, and give him the reasons. That's all, Monsieur."" M. Riviere bowed and drew back a step. ""Thank you,"" Archer said again, as their hands met.  XXVI. Every year on the fifteenth of October Fifth Avenue opened its shutters, unrolled its carpets and hung up its triple layer of window-curtains. By the first of November this household ritual was over, and society had begun to look about and take stock of itself. By the fifteenth the season was in full blast, Opera and theatres were putting forth their new attractions, dinner-engagements were accumulating, and dates for dances being fixed. And punctually at about this time Mrs. Archer always said that New York was very much changed. Observing it from the lofty stand-point of a non- participant, she was able, with the help of Mr. Sillerton Jackson and Miss Sophy, to trace each new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables. It had been one of the amusements of Archer's youth to wait for this annual pronouncement of his mother's, and to hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked. For New York, to Mrs. Archer's mind, never changed without changing for the worse; and in this view Miss Sophy Jackson heartily concurred. Mr. Sillerton Jackson, as became a man of the world, suspended his judgment and listened with an amused impartiality to the lamentations of the ladies. But even he never denied that New York had changed; and Newland Archer, in the winter of the second year of his marriage, was himself obliged to admit that if it had not actually changed it was certainly changing. These points had been raised, as usual, at Mrs. Archer's Thanksgiving dinner. At the date when she was officially enjoined to give thanks for the blessings of the year it was her habit to take a mournful though not embittered stock of her world, and wonder what there was to be thankful for. At any rate, not the state of society; society, if it could be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down Biblical imprecations-- and in fact, every one knew what the Reverend Dr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse 25) for his Thanksgiving sermon. Dr. Ashmore, the new Rector of St. Matthew's, had been chosen because he was very ""advanced"": his sermons were considered bold in thought and novel in language. When he fulminated against fashionable society he always spoke of its ""trend""; and to Mrs. Archer it was terrifying and yet fascinating to feel herself part of a community that was trending. ""There's no doubt that Dr. Ashmore is right: there IS a marked trend,"" she said, as if it were something visible and measurable, like a crack in a house. ""It was odd, though, to preach about it on Thanksgiving,"" Miss Jackson opined; and her hostess drily rejoined: ""Oh, he means us to give thanks for what's left."" Archer had been wont to smile at these annual vaticinations of his mother's; but this year even he was obliged to acknowledge, as he listened to an enumeration of the changes, that the ""trend"" was visible. ""The extravagance in dress--"" Miss Jackson began. ""Sillerton took me to the first night of the Opera, and I can only tell you that Jane Merry's dress was the only one I recognised from last year; and even that had had the front panel changed. Yet I know she got it out from Worth only two years ago, because my seamstress always goes in to make over her Paris dresses before she wears them."" ""Ah, Jane Merry is one of US,"" said Mrs. Archer sighing, as if it were not such an enviable thing to be in an age when ladies were beginning to flaunt abroad their Paris dresses as soon as they were out of the Custom House, instead of letting them mellow under lock and key, in the manner of Mrs. Archer's contemporaries. ""Yes; she's one of the few. In my youth,"" Miss Jackson rejoined, ""it was considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions; and Amy Sillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away one's Paris dresses for two years. Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow, who did everything handsomely, used to import twelve a year, two velvet, two satin, two silk, and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere. It was a standing order, and as she was ill for two years before she died they found forty-eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out of tissue paper; and when the girls left off their mourning they were able to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in advance of the fashion."" ""Ah, well, Boston is more conservative than New York; but I always think it's a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for one season,"" Mrs. Archer conceded. ""It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived: I must say at times it takes all Regina's distinction not to look like . . . like . . ."" Miss Jackson glanced around the table, caught Janey's bulging gaze, and took refuge in an unintelligible murmur. ""Like her rivals,"" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson, with the air of producing an epigram. ""Oh,--"" the ladies murmured; and Mrs. Archer added, partly to distract her daughter's attention from forbidden topics: ""Poor Regina! Her Thanksgiving hasn't been a very cheerful one, I'm afraid. Have you heard the rumours about Beaufort's speculations, Sillerton?"" Mr. Jackson nodded carelessly. Every one had heard the rumours in question, and he scorned to confirm a tale that was already common property. A gloomy silence fell upon the party. No one really liked Beaufort, and it was not wholly unpleasant to think the worst of his private life; but the idea of his having brought financial dishonour on his wife's family was too shocking to be enjoyed even by his enemies. Archer's New York tolerated hypocrisy in private relations; but in business matters it exacted a limpid and impeccable honesty. It was a long time since any well- known banker had failed discreditably; but every one remembered the social extinction visited on the heads of the firm when the last event of the kind had happened. It would be the same with the Beauforts, in spite of his power and her popularity; not all the leagued strength of the Dallas connection would save poor Regina if there were any truth in the reports of her husband's unlawful speculations. The talk took refuge in less ominous topics; but everything they touched on seemed to confirm Mrs. Archer's sense of an accelerated trend. ""Of course, Newland, I know you let dear May go to Mrs. Struthers's Sunday evenings--"" she began; and May interposed gaily: ""Oh, you know, everybody goes to Mrs. Struthers's now; and she was invited to Granny's last reception."" It was thus, Archer reflected, that New York managed its transitions: conspiring to ignore them till they were well over, and then, in all good faith, imagining that they had taken place in a preceding age. There was always a traitor in the citadel; and after he (or generally she) had surrendered the keys, what was the use of pretending that it was impregnable? Once people had tasted of Mrs. Struthers's easy Sunday hospitality they were not likely to sit at home remembering that her champagne was transmuted Shoe-Polish. ""I know, dear, I know,"" Mrs. Archer sighed. ""Such things have to be, I suppose, as long as AMUSEMENT is what people go out for; but I've never quite forgiven your cousin Madame Olenska for being the first person to countenance Mrs. Struthers."" A sudden blush rose to young Mrs. Archer's face; it surprised her husband as much as the other guests about the table. ""Oh, ELLEN--"" she murmured, much in the same accusing and yet deprecating tone in which her parents might have said: ""Oh, THE BLENKERS--."" It was the note which the family had taken to sounding on the mention of the Countess Olenska's name, since she had surprised and inconvenienced them by remaining obdurate to her husband's advances; but on May's lips it gave food for thought, and Archer looked at her with the sense of strangeness that sometimes came over him when she was most in the tone of her environment. His mother, with less than her usual sensitiveness to atmosphere, still insisted: ""I've always thought that people like the Countess Olenska, who have lived in aristocratic societies, ought to help us to keep up our social distinctions, instead of ignoring them."" May's blush remained permanently vivid: it seemed to have a significance beyond that implied by the recognition of Madame Olenska's social bad faith. ""I've no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners,"" said Miss Jackson tartly. ""I don't think Ellen cares for society; but nobody knows exactly what she does care for,"" May continued, as if she had been groping for something noncommittal. ""Ah, well--"" Mrs. Archer sighed again. Everybody knew that the Countess Olenska was no longer in the good graces of her family. Even her devoted champion, old Mrs. Manson Mingott, had been unable to defend her refusal to return to her husband. The Mingotts had not proclaimed their disapproval aloud: their sense of solidarity was too strong. They had simply, as Mrs. Welland said, ""let poor Ellen find her own level""--and that, mortifyingly and incomprehensibly, was in the dim depths where the Blenkers prevailed, and ""people who wrote"" celebrated their untidy rites. It was incredible, but it was a fact, that Ellen, in spite of all her opportunities and her privileges, had become simply ""Bohemian."" The fact enforced the contention that she had made a fatal mistake in not returning to Count Olenski. After all, a young woman's place was under her husband's roof, especially when she had left it in circumstances that . . . well . . . if one had cared to look into them . . . ""Madame Olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen,"" said Miss Sophy, with her air of wishing to put forth something conciliatory when she knew that she was planting a dart. ""Ah, that's the danger that a young woman like Madame Olenska is always exposed to,"" Mrs. Archer mournfully agreed; and the ladies, on this conclusion, gathered up their trains to seek the carcel globes of the drawing-room, while Archer and Mr. Sillerton Jackson withdrew to the Gothic library. Once established before the grate, and consoling Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton himself for the inadequacy of the dinner by the perfection of his cigar, Mr. Jackson became portentous and communicable. ""If the Beaufort smash comes,"" he announced, ""there are going to be disclosures."" Archer raised his head quickly: he could never hear the name without the sharp vision of Beaufort's heavy figure, opulently furred and shod, advancing through the snow at Skuytercliff. ""There's bound to be,"" Mr. Jackson continued, ""the nastiest kind of a cleaning up. He hasn't spent all his money on Regina."" ""Oh, well--that's discounted, isn't it? My belief is he'll pull out yet,"" said the young man, wanting to change the subject. ""Perhaps--perhaps. I know he was to see some of the influential people today. Of course,"" Mr. Jackson reluctantly conceded, ""it's to be hoped they can tide him over--this time anyhow. I shouldn't like to think of poor Regina's spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign watering-place for bankrupts."" Archer said nothing. It seemed to him so natural-- however tragic--that money ill-gotten should be cruelly expiated, that his mind, hardly lingering over Mrs. Beaufort's doom, wandered back to closer questions. What was the meaning of May's blush when the Countess Olenska had been mentioned? Four months had passed since the midsummer day that he and Madame Olenska had spent together; and since then he had not seen her. He knew that she had returned to Washington, to the little house which she and Medora Manson had taken there: he had written to her once--a few words, asking when they were to meet again--and she had even more briefly replied: ""Not yet."" Since then there had been no farther communication between them, and he had built up within himself a kind of sanctuary in which she throned among his secret thoughts and longings. Little by little it became the scene of his real life, of his only rational activities; thither he brought the books he read, the ideas and feelings which nourished him, his judgments and his visions. Outside it, in the scene of his actual life, he moved with a growing sense of unreality and insufficiency, blundering against familiar prejudices and traditional points of view as an absent-minded man goes on bumping into the furniture of his own room. Absent--that was what he was: so absent from everything most densely real and near to those about him that it sometimes startled him to find they still imagined he was there. He became aware that Mr. Jackson was clearing his throat preparatory to farther revelations. ""I don't know, of course, how far your wife's family are aware of what people say about--well, about Madame Olenska's refusal to accept her husband's latest offer."" Archer was silent, and Mr. Jackson obliquely continued: ""It's a pity--it's certainly a pity--that she refused it."" ""A pity? In God's name, why?"" Mr. Jackson looked down his leg to the unwrinkled sock that joined it to a glossy pump. ""Well--to put it on the lowest ground--what's she going to live on now?"" ""Now--?"" ""If Beaufort--"" Archer sprang up, his fist banging down on the black walnut-edge of the writing-table. The wells of the brass double-inkstand danced in their sockets. ""What the devil do you mean, sir?"" Mr. Jackson, shifting himself slightly in his chair, turned a tranquil gaze on the young man's burning face. ""Well--I have it on pretty good authority--in fact, on old Catherine's herself--that the family reduced Countess Olenska's allowance considerably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband; and as, by this refusal, she also forfeits the money settled on her when she married--which Olenski was ready to make over to her if she returned--why, what the devil do YOU mean, my dear boy, by asking me what I mean?"" Mr. Jackson good-humouredly retorted. Archer moved toward the mantelpiece and bent over to knock his ashes into the grate. ""I don't know anything of Madame Olenska's private affairs; but I don't need to, to be certain that what you insinuate--"" ""Oh, I don't: it's Lefferts, for one,"" Mr. Jackson interposed. ""Lefferts--who made love to her and got snubbed for it!"" Archer broke out contemptuously. ""Ah--DID he?"" snapped the other, as if this were exactly the fact he had been laying a trap for. He still sat sideways from the fire, so that his hard old gaze held Archer's face as if in a spring of steel. ""Well, well: it's a pity she didn't go back before Beaufort's cropper,"" he repeated. ""If she goes NOW, and if he fails, it will only confirm the general impression: which isn't by any means peculiar to Lefferts, by the way. ""Oh, she won't go back now: less than ever!"" Archer had no sooner said it than he had once more the feeling that it was exactly what Mr. Jackson had been waiting for. The old gentleman considered him attentively. ""That's your opinion, eh? Well, no doubt you know. But everybody will tell you that the few pennies Medora Manson has left are all in Beaufort's hands; and how the two women are to keep their heads above water unless he does, I can't imagine. Of course, Madame Olenska may still soften old Catherine, who's been the most inexorably opposed to her staying; and old Catherine could make her any allowance she chooses. But we all know that she hates parting with good money; and the rest of the family have no particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here."" Archer was burning with unavailing wrath: he was exactly in the state when a man is sure to do something stupid, knowing all the while that he is doing it. He saw that Mr. Jackson had been instantly struck by the fact that Madame Olenska's differences with her grandmother and her other relations were not known to him, and that the old gentleman had drawn his own conclusions as to the reasons for Archer's exclusion from the family councils. This fact warned Archer to go warily; but the insinuations about Beaufort made him reckless. He was mindful, however, if not of his own danger, at least of the fact that Mr. Jackson was under his mother's roof, and consequently his guest. Old New York scrupulously observed the etiquette of hospitality, and no discussion with a guest was ever allowed to degenerate into a disagreement. ""Shall we go up and join my mother?"" he suggested curtly, as Mr. Jackson's last cone of ashes dropped into the brass ashtray at his elbow. On the drive homeward May remained oddly silent; through the darkness, he still felt her enveloped in her menacing blush. What its menace meant he could not guess: but he was sufficiently warned by the fact that Madame Olenska's name had evoked it. They went upstairs, and he turned into the library. She usually followed him; but he heard her passing down the passage to her bedroom. ""May!"" he called out impatiently; and she came back, with a slight glance of surprise at his tone. ""This lamp is smoking again; I should think the servants might see that it's kept properly trimmed,"" he grumbled nervously. ""I'm so sorry: it shan't happen again,"" she answered, in the firm bright tone she had learned from her mother; and it exasperated Archer to feel that she was already beginning to humour him like a younger Mr. Welland. She bent over to lower the wick, and as the light struck up on her white shoulders and the clear curves of her face he thought: ""How young she is! For what endless years this life will have to go on!"" He felt, with a kind of horror, his own strong youth and the bounding blood in his veins. ""Look here,"" he said suddenly, ""I may have to go to Washington for a few days--soon; next week perhaps."" Her hand remained on the key of the lamp as she turned to him slowly. The heat from its flame had brought back a glow to her face, but it paled as she looked up. ""On business?"" she asked, in a tone which implied that there could be no other conceivable reason, and that she had put the question automatically, as if merely to finish his own sentence. ""On business, naturally. There's a patent case coming up before the Supreme Court--"" He gave the name of the inventor, and went on furnishing details with all Lawrence Lefferts's practised glibness, while she listened attentively, saying at intervals: ""Yes, I see."" ""The change will do you good,"" she said simply, when he had finished; ""and you must be sure to go and see Ellen,"" she added, looking him straight in the eyes with her cloudless smile, and speaking in the tone she might have employed in urging him not to neglect some irksome family duty. It was the only word that passed between them on the subject; but in the code in which they had both been trained it meant: ""Of course you understand that I know all that people have been saying about Ellen, and heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to return to her husband. I also know that, for some reason you have not chosen to tell me, you have advised her against this course, which all the older men of the family, as well as our grandmother, agree in approving; and that it is owing to your encouragement that Ellen defies us all, and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which Mr. Sillerton Jackson probably gave you, this evening, the hint that has made you so irritable. . . . Hints have indeed not been wanting; but since you appear unwilling to take them from others, I offer you this one myself, in the only form in which well-bred people of our kind can communicate unpleasant things to each other: by letting you understand that I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington, and are perhaps going there expressly for that purpose; and that, since you are sure to see her, I wish you to do so with my full and explicit approval-- and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the course of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to."" Her hand was still on the key of the lamp when the last word of this mute message reached him. She turned the wick down, lifted off the globe, and breathed on the sulky flame. ""They smell less if one blows them out,"" she explained, with her bright housekeeping air. On the threshold she turned and paused for his kiss.  XXVII. Wall Street, the next day, had more reassuring reports of Beaufort's situation. They were not definite, but they were hopeful. It was generally understood that he could call on powerful influences in case of emergency, and that he had done so with success; and that evening, when Mrs. Beaufort appeared at the Opera wearing her old smile and a new emerald necklace, society drew a breath of relief. New York was inexorable in its condemnation of business irregularities. So far there had been no exception to its tacit rule that those who broke the law of probity must pay; and every one was aware that even Beaufort and Beaufort's wife would be offered up unflinchingly to this principle. But to be obliged to offer them up would be not only painful but inconvenient. The disappearance of the Beauforts would leave a considerable void in their compact little circle; and those who were too ignorant or too careless to shudder at the moral catastrophe bewailed in advance the loss of the best ball-room in New York. Archer had definitely made up his mind to go to Washington. He was waiting only for the opening of the law-suit of which he had spoken to May, so that its date might coincide with that of his visit; but on the following Tuesday he learned from Mr. Letterblair that the case might be postponed for several weeks. Nevertheless, he went home that afternoon determined in any event to leave the next evening. The chances were that May, who knew nothing of his professional life, and had never shown any interest in it, would not learn of the postponement, should it take place, nor remember the names of the litigants if they were mentioned before her; and at any rate he could no longer put off seeing Madame Olenska. There were too many things that he must say to her. On the Wednesday morning, when he reached his office, Mr. Letterblair met him with a troubled face. Beaufort, after all, had not managed to ""tide over""; but by setting afloat the rumour that he had done so he had reassured his depositors, and heavy payments had poured into the bank till the previous evening, when disturbing reports again began to predominate. In consequence, a run on the bank had begun, and its doors were likely to close before the day was over. The ugliest things were being said of Beaufort's dastardly manoeuvre, and his failure promised to be one of the most discreditable in the history of Wall Street. The extent of the calamity left Mr. Letterblair white and incapacitated. ""I've seen bad things in my time; but nothing as bad as this. Everybody we know will be hit, one way or another. And what will be done about Mrs. Beaufort? What CAN be done about her? I pity Mrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody: coming at her age, there's no knowing what effect this affair may have on her. She always believed in Beaufort--she made a friend of him! And there's the whole Dallas connection: poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you. Her only chance would be to leave her husband--yet how can any one tell her so? Her duty is at his side; and luckily she seems always to have been blind to his private weaknesses."" There was a knock, and Mr. Letterblair turned his head sharply. ""What is it? I can't be disturbed."" A clerk brought in a letter for Archer and withdrew. Recognising his wife's hand, the young man opened the envelope and read: ""Won't you please come up town as early as you can? Granny had a slight stroke last night. In some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank. Uncle Lovell is away shooting, and the idea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a temperature and can't leave his room. Mamma needs you dreadfully, and I do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny's."" Archer handed the note to his senior partner, and a few minutes later was crawling northward in a crowded horse-car, which he exchanged at Fourteenth Street for one of the high staggering omnibuses of the Fifth Avenue line. It was after twelve o'clock when this laborious vehicle dropped him at old Catherine's. The sitting-room window on the ground floor, where she usually throned, was tenanted by the inadequate figure of her daughter, Mrs. Welland, who signed a haggard welcome as she caught sight of Archer; and at the door he was met by May. The hall wore the unnatural appearance peculiar to well-kept houses suddenly invaded by illness: wraps and furs lay in heaps on the chairs, a doctor's bag and overcoat were on the table, and beside them letters and cards had already piled up unheeded. May looked pale but smiling: Dr. Bencomb, who had just come for the second time, took a more hopeful view, and Mrs. Mingott's dauntless determination to live and get well was already having an effect on her family. May led Archer into the old lady's sitting-room, where the sliding doors opening into the bedroom had been drawn shut, and the heavy yellow damask portieres dropped over them; and here Mrs. Welland communicated to him in horrified undertones the details of the catastrophe. It appeared that the evening before something dreadful and mysterious had happened. At about eight o'clock, just after Mrs. Mingott had finished the game of solitaire that she always played after dinner, the door-bell had rung, and a lady so thickly veiled that the servants did not immediately recognise her had asked to be received. The butler, hearing a familiar voice, had thrown open the sitting-room door, announcing: ""Mrs. Julius Beaufort""--and had then closed it again on the two ladies. They must have been together, he thought, about an hour. When Mrs. Mingott's bell rang Mrs. Beaufort had already slipped away unseen, and the old lady, white and vast and terrible, sat alone in her great chair, and signed to the butler to help her into her room. She seemed, at that time, though obviously distressed, in complete control of her body and brain. The mulatto maid put her to bed, brought her a cup of tea as usual, laid everything straight in the room, and went away; but at three in the morning the bell rang again, and the two servants, hastening in at this unwonted summons (for old Catherine usually slept like a baby), had found their mistress sitting up against her pillows with a crooked smile on her face and one little hand hanging limp from its huge arm. The stroke had clearly been a slight one, for she was able to articulate and to make her wishes known; and soon after the doctor's first visit she had begun to regain control of her facial muscles. But the alarm had been great; and proportionately great was the indignation when it was gathered from Mrs. Mingott's fragmentary phrases that Regina Beaufort had come to ask her--incredible effrontery!--to back up her husband, see them through--not to ""desert"" them, as she called it--in fact to induce the whole family to cover and condone their monstrous dishonour. ""I said to her: ""Honour's always been honour, and honesty honesty, in Manson Mingott's house, and will be till I'm carried out of it feet first,'"" the old woman had stammered into her daughter's ear, in the thick voice of the partly paralysed. ""And when she said: `But my name, Auntie--my name's Regina Dallas,' I said: `It was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels, and it's got to stay Beaufort now that he's covered you with shame.'"" So much, with tears and gasps of horror, Mrs. Welland imparted, blanched and demolished by the unwonted obligation of having at last to fix her eyes on the unpleasant and the discreditable. ""If only I could keep it from your father-in-law: he always says: `Augusta, for pity's sake, don't destroy my last illusions' --and how am I to prevent his knowing these horrors?"" the poor lady wailed. ""After all, Mamma, he won't have SEEN them,"" her daughter suggested; and Mrs. Welland sighed: ""Ah, no; thank heaven he's safe in bed. And Dr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better, and Regina has been got away somewhere."" Archer had seated himself near the window and was gazing out blankly at the deserted thoroughfare. It was evident that he had been summoned rather for the moral support of the stricken ladies than because of any specific aid that he could render. Mr. Lovell Mingott had been telegraphed for, and messages were being despatched by hand to the members of the family living in New York; and meanwhile there was nothing to do but to discuss in hushed tones the consequences of Beaufort's dishonour and of his wife's unjustifiable action. Mrs. Lovell Mingott, who had been in another room writing notes, presently reappeared, and added her voice to the discussion. In THEIR day, the elder ladies agreed, the wife of a man who had done anything disgraceful in business had only one idea: to efface herself, to disappear with him. ""There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer; your great-grandmother, May. Of course,"" Mrs. Welland hastened to add, ""your great- grandfather's money difficulties were private--losses at cards, or signing a note for somebody--I never quite knew, because Mamma would never speak of it. But she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace, whatever it was: they lived up the Hudson alone, winter and summer, till Mamma was sixteen. It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask the family to `countenance' her, as I understand Regina calls it; though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people."" ""Yes, it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance than to talk about other people's,"" Mrs. Lovell Mingott agreed. ""I understand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday had been sent on approval from Ball and Black's in the afternoon. I wonder if they'll ever get it back?"" Archer listened unmoved to the relentless chorus. The idea of absolute financial probity as the first law of a gentleman's code was too deeply ingrained in him for sentimental considerations to weaken it. An adventurer like Lemuel Struthers might build up the millions of his Shoe Polish on any number of shady dealings; but unblemished honesty was the noblesse oblige of old financial New York. Nor did Mrs. Beaufort's fate greatly move Archer. He felt, no doubt, more sorry for her than her indignant relatives; but it seemed to him that the tie between husband and wife, even if breakable in prosperity, should be indissoluble in misfortune. As Mr. Letterblair had said, a wife's place was at her husband's side when he was in trouble; but society's place was not at his side, and Mrs. Beaufort's cool assumption that it was seemed almost to make her his accomplice. The mere idea of a woman's appealing to her family to screen her husband's business dishonour was inadmissible, since it was the one thing that the Family, as an institution, could not do. The mulatto maid called Mrs. Lovell Mingott into the hall, and the latter came back in a moment with a frowning brow. ""She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska. I had written to Ellen, of course, and to Medora; but now it seems that's not enough. I'm to telegraph to her immediately, and to tell her that she's to come alone."" The announcement was received in silence. Mrs. Welland sighed resignedly, and May rose from her seat and went to gather up some newspapers that had been scattered on the floor. ""I suppose it must be done,"" Mrs. Lovell Mingott continued, as if hoping to be contradicted; and May turned back toward the middle of the room. ""Of course it must be done,"" she said. ""Granny knows what she wants, and we must carry out all her wishes. Shall I write the telegram for you, Auntie? If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow morning's train."" She pronounced the syllables of the name with a peculiar clearness, as if she had tapped on two silver bells. ""Well, it can't go at once. Jasper and the pantry-boy are both out with notes and telegrams."" May turned to her husband with a smile. ""But here's Newland, ready to do anything. Will you take the telegram, Newland? There'll be just time before luncheon."" Archer rose with a murmur of readiness, and she seated herself at old Catherine's rosewood ""Bonheur du Jour,"" and wrote out the message in her large immature hand. When it was written she blotted it neatly and handed it to Archer. ""What a pity,"" she said, ""that you and Ellen will cross each other on the way!--Newland,"" she added, turning to her mother and aunt, ""is obliged to go to Washington about a patent law-suit that is coming up before the Supreme Court. I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by tomorrow night, and with Granny improving so much it doesn't seem right to ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm--does it?"" She paused, as if for an answer, and Mrs. Welland hastily declared: ""Oh, of course not, darling. Your Granny would be the last person to wish it."" As Archer left the room with the telegram, he heard his mother-in- law add, presumably to Mrs. Lovell Mingott: ""But why on earth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska--"" and May's clear voice rejoin: ""Perhaps it's to urge on her again that after all her duty is with her husband."" The outer door closed on Archer and he walked hastily away toward the telegraph office.  XXVIII. Ol-ol--howjer spell it, anyhow?"" asked the tart young lady to whom Archer had pushed his wife's telegram across the brass ledge of the Western Union office. ""Olenska--O-len-ska,"" he repeated, drawing back the message in order to print out the foreign syllables above May's rambling script. ""It's an unlikely name for a New York telegraph office; at least in this quarter,"" an unexpected voice observed; and turning around Archer saw Lawrence Lefferts at his elbow, pulling an imperturbable moustache and affecting not to glance at the message. ""Hallo, Newland: thought I'd catch you here. I've just heard of old Mrs. Mingott's stroke; and as I was on my way to the house I saw you turning down this street and nipped after you. I suppose you've come from there?"" Archer nodded, and pushed his telegram under the lattice. ""Very bad, eh?"" Lefferts continued. ""Wiring to the family, I suppose. I gather it IS bad, if you're including Countess Olenska."" Archer's lips stiffened; he felt a savage impulse to dash his fist into the long vain handsome face at his side. ""Why?"" he questioned. Lefferts, who was known to shrink from discussion, raised his eye-brows with an ironic grimace that warned the other of the watching damsel behind the lattice. Nothing could be worse ""form"" the look reminded Archer, than any display of temper in a public place. Archer had never been more indifferent to the requirements of form; but his impulse to do Lawrence Lefferts a physical injury was only momentary. The idea of bandying Ellen Olenska's name with him at such a time, and on whatsoever provocation, was unthinkable. He paid for his telegram, and the two young men went out together into the street. There Archer, having regained his self-control, went on: ""Mrs. Mingott is much better: the doctor feels no anxiety whatever""; and Lefferts, with profuse expressions of relief, asked him if he had heard that there were beastly bad rumours again about Beaufort. . . . That afternoon the announcement of the Beaufort failure was in all the papers. It overshadowed the report of Mrs. Manson Mingott's stroke, and only the few who had heard of the mysterious connection between the two events thought of ascribing old Catherine's illness to anything but the accumulation of flesh and years. The whole of New York was darkened by the tale of Beaufort's dishonour. There had never, as Mr. Letterblair said, been a worse case in his memory, nor, for that matter, in the memory of the far-off Letterblair who had given his name to the firm. The bank had continued to take in money for a whole day after its failure was inevitable; and as many of its clients belonged to one or another of the ruling clans, Beaufort's duplicity seemed doubly cynical. If Mrs. Beaufort had not taken the tone that such misfortunes (the word was her own) were ""the test of friendship,"" compassion for her might have tempered the general indignation against her husband. As it was--and especially after the object of her nocturnal visit to Mrs. Manson Mingott had become known--her cynicism was held to exceed his; and she had not the excuse--nor her detractors the satisfaction-- of pleading that she was ""a foreigner."" It was some comfort (to those whose securities were not in jeopardy) to be able to remind themselves that Beaufort WAS; but, after all, if a Dallas of South Carolina took his view of the case, and glibly talked of his soon being ""on his feet again,"" the argument lost its edge, and there was nothing to do but to accept this awful evidence of the indissolubility of marriage. Society must manage to get on without the Beauforts, and there was an end of it--except indeed for such hapless victims of the disaster as Medora Manson, the poor old Miss Lannings, and certain other misguided ladies of good family who, if only they had listened to Mr. Henry van der Luyden . . . ""The best thing the Beauforts can do,"" said Mrs. Archer, summing it up as if she were pronouncing a diagnosis and prescribing a course of treatment, ""is to go and live at Regina's little place in North Carolina. Beaufort has always kept a racing stable, and he had better breed trotting horses. I should say he had all the qualities of a successful horsedealer."" Every one agreed with her, but no one condescended to enquire what the Beauforts really meant to do. The next day Mrs. Manson Mingott was much better: she recovered her voice sufficiently to give orders that no one should mention the Beauforts to her again, and asked--when Dr. Bencomb appeared--what in the world her family meant by making such a fuss about her health. ""If people of my age WILL eat chicken-salad in the evening what are they to expect?"" she enquired; and, the doctor having opportunely modified her dietary, the stroke was transformed into an attack of indigestion. But in spite of her firm tone old Catherine did not wholly recover her former attitude toward life. The growing remoteness of old age, though it had not diminished her curiosity about her neighbours, had blunted her never very lively compassion for their troubles; and she seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort disaster out of her mind. But for the first time she became absorbed in her own symptoms, and began to take a sentimental interest in certain members of her family to whom she had hitherto been contemptuously indifferent. Mr. Welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her notice. Of her sons-in-law he was the one she had most consistently ignored; and all his wife's efforts to represent him as a man of forceful character and marked intellectual ability (if he had only ""chosen"") had been met with a derisive chuckle. But his eminence as a valetudinarian now made him an object of engrossing interest, and Mrs. Mingott issued an imperial summons to him to come and compare diets as soon as his temperature permitted; for old Catherine was now the first to recognise that one could not be too careful about temperatures. Twenty-four hours after Madame Olenska's summons a telegram announced that she would arrive from Washington on the evening of the following day. At the Wellands', where the Newland Archers chanced to be lunching, the question as to who should meet her at Jersey City was immediately raised; and the material difficulties amid which the Welland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent animation to the debate. It was agreed that Mrs. Welland could not possibly go to Jersey City because she was to accompany her husband to old Catherine's that afternoon, and the brougham could not be spared, since, if Mr. Welland were ""upset"" by seeing his mother-in-law for the first time after her attack, he might have to be taken home at a moment's notice. The Welland sons would of course be ""down town,"" Mr. Lovell Mingott would be just hurrying back from his shooting, and the Mingott carriage engaged in meeting him; and one could not ask May, at the close of a winter afternoon, to go alone across the ferry to Jersey City, even in her own carriage. Nevertheless, it might appear inhospitable --and contrary to old Catherine's express wishes--if Madame Olenska were allowed to arrive without any of the family being at the station to receive her. It was just like Ellen, Mrs. Welland's tired voice implied, to place the family in such a dilemma. ""It's always one thing after another,"" the poor lady grieved, in one of her rare revolts against fate; ""the only thing that makes me think Mamma must be less well than Dr. Bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have Ellen come at once, however inconvenient it is to meet her."" The words had been thoughtless, as the utterances of impatience often are; and Mr. Welland was upon them with a pounce. ""Augusta,"" he said, turning pale and laying down his fork, ""have you any other reason for thinking that Bencomb is less to be relied on than he was? Have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than usual in following up my case or your mother's?"" It was Mrs. Welland's turn to grow pale as the endless consequences of her blunder unrolled themselves before her; but she managed to laugh, and take a second helping of scalloped oysters, before she said, struggling back into her old armour of cheerfulness: ""My dear, how could you imagine such a thing? I only meant that, after the decided stand Mamma took about its being Ellen's duty to go back to her husband, it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden whim to see her, when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that she might have asked for. But we must never forget that Mamma, in spite of her wonderful vitality, is a very old woman."" Mr. Welland's brow remained clouded, and it was evident that his perturbed imagination had fastened at once on this last remark. ""Yes: your mother's a very old woman; and for all we know Bencomb may not be as successful with very old people. As you say, my dear, it's always one thing after another; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose I shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor. It's always better to make such a change before it's absolutely necessary."" And having arrived at this Spartan decision Mr. Welland firmly took up his fork. ""But all the while,"" Mrs. Welland began again, as she rose from the luncheon-table, and led the way into the wilderness of purple satin and malachite known as the back drawing-room, ""I don't see how Ellen's to be got here tomorrow evening; and I do like to have things settled for at least twenty-four hours ahead."" Archer turned from the fascinated contemplation of a small painting representing two Cardinals carousing, in an octagonal ebony frame set with medallions of onyx. ""Shall I fetch her?"" he proposed. ""I can easily get away from the office in time to meet the brougham at the ferry, if May will send it there."" His heart was beating excitedly as he spoke. Mrs. Welland heaved a sigh of gratitude, and May, who had moved away to the window, turned to shed on him a beam of approval. ""So you see, Mamma, everything WILL be settled twenty-four hours in advance,"" she said, stooping over to kiss her mother's troubled forehead. May's brougham awaited her at the door, and she was to drive Archer to Union Square, where he could pick up a Broadway car to carry him to the office. As she settled herself in her corner she said: ""I didn't want to worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles; but how can you meet Ellen tomorrow, and bring her back to New York, when you're going to Washington?"" ""Oh, I'm not going,"" Archer answered. ""Not going? Why, what's happened?"" Her voice was as clear as a bell, and full of wifely solicitude. ""The case is off--postponed."" ""Postponed? How odd! I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair to Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big patent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court. You said it was a patent case, didn't you?"" ""Well--that's it: the whole office can't go. Letterblair decided to go this morning."" ""Then it's NOT postponed?"" she continued, with an insistence so unlike her that he felt the blood rising to his face, as if he were blushing for her unwonted lapse from all the traditional delicacies. ""No: but my going is,"" he answered, cursing the unnecessary explanations that he had given when he had announced his intention of going to Washington, and wondering where he had read that clever liars give details, but that the cleverest do not. It did not hurt him half as much to tell May an untruth as to see her trying to pretend that she had not detected him. ""I'm not going till later on: luckily for the convenience of your family,"" he continued, taking base refuge in sarcasm. As he spoke he felt that she was looking at him, and he turned his eyes to hers in order not to appear to be avoiding them. Their glances met for a second, and perhaps let them into each other's meanings more deeply than either cared to go. ""Yes; it IS awfully convenient,"" May brightly agreed, ""that you should be able to meet Ellen after all; you saw how much Mamma appreciated your offering to do it."" ""Oh, I'm delighted to do it."" The carriage stopped, and as he jumped out she leaned to him and laid her hand on his. ""Good-bye, dearest,"" she said, her eyes so blue that he wondered afterward if they had shone on him through tears. He turned away and hurried across Union Square, repeating to himself, in a sort of inward chant: ""It's all of two hours from Jersey City to old Catherine's. It's all of two hours--and it may be more.""  XXIX. His wife's dark blue brougham (with the wedding varnish still on it) met Archer at the ferry, and conveyed him luxuriously to the Pennsylvania terminus in Jersey City. It was a sombre snowy afternoon, and the gas-lamps were lit in the big reverberating station. As he paced the platform, waiting for the Washington express, he remembered that there were people who thought there would one day be a tunnel under the Hudson through which the trains of the Pennsylvania railway would run straight into New York. They were of the brotherhood of visionaries who likewise predicted the building of ships that would cross the Atlantic in five days, the invention of a flying machine, lighting by electricity, telephonic communication without wires, and other Arabian Night marvels. ""I don't care which of their visions comes true,"" Archer mused, ""as long as the tunnel isn't built yet."" In his senseless school-boy happiness he pictured Madame Olenska's descent from the train, his discovery of her a long way off, among the throngs of meaningless faces, her clinging to his arm as he guided her to the carriage, their slow approach to the wharf among slipping horses, laden carts, vociferating teamsters, and then the startling quiet of the ferry-boat, where they would sit side by side under the snow, in the motionless carriage, while the earth seemed to glide away under them, rolling to the other side of the sun. It was incredible, the number of things he had to say to her, and in what eloquent order they were forming themselves on his lips . . . The clanging and groaning of the train came nearer, and it staggered slowly into the station like a prey- laden monster into its lair. Archer pushed forward, elbowing through the crowd, and staring blindly into window after window of the high-hung carriages. And then, suddenly, he saw Madame Olenska's pale and surprised face close at hand, and had again the mortified sensation of having forgotten what she looked like. They reached each other, their hands met, and he drew her arm through his. ""This way--I have the carriage,"" he said. After that it all happened as he had dreamed. He helped her into the brougham with her bags, and had afterward the vague recollection of having properly reassured her about her grandmother and given her a summary of the Beaufort situation (he was struck by the softness of her: ""Poor Regina!""). Meanwhile the carriage had worked its way out of the coil about the station, and they were crawling down the slippery incline to the wharf, menaced by swaying coal-carts, bewildered horses, dishevelled express-wagons, and an empty hearse--ah, that hearse! She shut her eyes as it passed, and clutched at Archer's hand. ""If only it doesn't mean--poor Granny!"" ""Oh, no, no--she's much better--she's all right, really. There--we've passed it!"" he exclaimed, as if that made all the difference. Her hand remained in his, and as the carriage lurched across the gang-plank onto the ferry he bent over, unbuttoned her tight brown glove, and kissed her palm as if he had kissed a relic. She disengaged herself with a faint smile, and he said: ""You didn't expect me today?"" ""Oh, no."" ""I meant to go to Washington to see you. I'd made all my arrangements--I very nearly crossed you in the train."" ""Oh--"" she exclaimed, as if terrified by the narrowness of their escape. ""Do you know--I hardly remembered you?"" ""Hardly remembered me?"" ""I mean: how shall I explain? I--it's always so. EACH TIME YOU HAPPEN TO ME ALL OVER AGAIN."" ""Oh, yes: I know! I know!"" ""Does it--do I too: to you?"" he insisted. She nodded, looking out of the window. ""Ellen--Ellen--Ellen!"" She made no answer, and he sat in silence, watching her profile grow indistinct against the snow-streaked dusk beyond the window. What had she been doing in all those four long months, he wondered? How little they knew of each other, after all! The precious moments were slipping away, but he had forgotten everything that he had meant to say to her and could only helplessly brood on the mystery of their remoteness and their proximity, which seemed to be symbolised by the fact of their sitting so close to each other, and yet being unable to see each other's faces. ""What a pretty carriage! Is it May's?"" she asked, suddenly turning her face from the window. ""Yes."" ""It was May who sent you to fetch me, then? How kind of her!"" He made no answer for a moment; then he said explosively: ""Your husband's secretary came to see me the day after we met in Boston."" In his brief letter to her he had made no allusion to M. Riviere's visit, and his intention had been to bury the incident in his bosom. But her reminder that they were in his wife's carriage provoked him to an impulse of retaliation. He would see if she liked his reference to Riviere any better than he liked hers to May! As on certain other occasions when he had expected to shake her out of her usual composure, she betrayed no sign of surprise: and at once he concluded: ""He writes to her, then."" ""M. Riviere went to see you?"" ""Yes: didn't you know?"" ""No,"" she answered simply. ""And you're not surprised?"" She hesitated. ""Why should I be? He told me in Boston that he knew you; that he'd met you in England I think."" ""Ellen--I must ask you one thing."" ""Yes."" ""I wanted to ask it after I saw him, but I couldn't put it in a letter. It was Riviere who helped you to get away--when you left your husband?"" His heart was beating suffocatingly. Would she meet this question with the same composure? ""Yes: I owe him a great debt,"" she answered, without the least tremor in her quiet voice. Her tone was so natural, so almost indifferent, that Archer's turmoil subsided. Once more she had managed, by her sheer simplicity, to make him feel stupidly conventional just when he thought he was flinging convention to the winds. ""I think you're the most honest woman I ever met!"" he exclaimed. ""Oh, no--but probably one of the least fussy,"" she answered, a smile in her voice. ""Call it what you like: you look at things as they are."" ""Ah--I've had to. I've had to look at the Gorgon."" ""Well--it hasn't blinded you! You've seen that she's just an old bogey like all the others."" ""She doesn't blind one; but she dries up one's tears."" The answer checked the pleading on Archer's lips: it seemed to come from depths of experience beyond his reach. The slow advance of the ferry-boat had ceased, and her bows bumped against the piles of the slip with a violence that made the brougham stagger, and flung Archer and Madame Olenska against each other. The young man, trembling, felt the pressure of her shoulder, and passed his arm about her. ""If you're not blind, then, you must see that this can't last."" ""What can't?"" ""Our being together--and not together."" ""No. You ought not to have come today,"" she said in an altered voice; and suddenly she turned, flung her arms about him and pressed her lips to his. At the same moment the carriage began to move, and a gas-lamp at the head of the slip flashed its light into the window. She drew away, and they sat silent and motionless while the brougham struggled through the congestion of carriages about the ferry-landing. As they gained the street Archer began to speak hurriedly. ""Don't be afraid of me: you needn't squeeze yourself back into your corner like that. A stolen kiss isn't what I want. Look: I'm not even trying to touch the sleeve of your jacket. Don't suppose that I don't understand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us dwindle into an ordinary hole-and-corner love-affair. I couldn't have spoken like this yesterday, because when we've been apart, and I'm looking forward to seeing you, every thought is burnt up in a great flame. But then you come; and you're so much more than I remembered, and what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then, with wastes of thirsty waiting between, that I can sit perfectly still beside you, like this, with that other vision in my mind, just quietly trusting to it to come true."" For a moment she made no reply; then she asked, hardly above a whisper: ""What do you mean by trusting to it to come true?"" ""Why--you know it will, don't you?"" ""Your vision of you and me together?"" She burst into a sudden hard laugh. ""You choose your place well to put it to me!"" ""Do you mean because we're in my wife's brougham? Shall we get out and walk, then? I don't suppose you mind a little snow?"" She laughed again, more gently. ""No; I shan't get out and walk, because my business is to get to Granny's as quickly as I can. And you'll sit beside me, and we'll look, not at visions, but at realities."" ""I don't know what you mean by realities. The only reality to me is this."" She met the words with a long silence, during which the carriage rolled down an obscure side-street and then turned into the searching illumination of Fifth Avenue. ""Is it your idea, then, that I should live with you as your mistress--since I can't be your wife?"" she asked. The crudeness of the question startled him: the word was one that women of his class fought shy of, even when their talk flitted closest about the topic. He noticed that Madame Olenska pronounced it as if it had a recognised place in her vocabulary, and he wondered if it had been used familiarly in her presence in the horrible life she had fled from. Her question pulled him up with a jerk, and he floundered. ""I want--I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like that--categories like that-- won't exist. Where we shall be simply two human beings who love each other, who are the whole of life to each other; and nothing else on earth will matter."" She drew a deep sigh that ended in another laugh. ""Oh, my dear--where is that country? Have you ever been there?"" she asked; and as he remained sullenly dumb she went on: ""I know so many who've tried to find it; and, believe me, they all got out by mistake at wayside stations: at places like Boulogne, or Pisa, or Monte Carlo--and it wasn't at all different from the old world they'd left, but only rather smaller and dingier and more promiscuous."" He had never heard her speak in such a tone, and he remembered the phrase she had used a little while before. ""Yes, the Gorgon HAS dried your tears,"" he said. ""Well, she opened my eyes too; it's a delusion to say that she blinds people. What she does is just the contrary--she fastens their eyelids open, so that they're never again in the blessed darkness. Isn't there a Chinese torture like that? There ought to be. Ah, believe me, it's a miserable little country!"" The carriage had crossed Forty-second Street: May's sturdy brougham-horse was carrying them northward as if he had been a Kentucky trotter. Archer choked with the sense of wasted minutes and vain words. ""Then what, exactly, is your plan for us?"" he asked. ""For US? But there's no US in that sense! We're near each other only if we stay far from each other. Then we can be ourselves. Otherwise we're only Newland Archer, the husband of Ellen Olenska's cousin, and Ellen Olenska, the cousin of Newland Archer's wife, trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them."" ""Ah, I'm beyond that,"" he groaned. ""No, you're not! You've never been beyond. And I have,"" she said, in a strange voice, ""and I know what it looks like there."" He sat silent, dazed with inarticulate pain. Then he groped in the darkness of the carriage for the little bell that signalled orders to the coachman. He remembered that May rang twice when she wished to stop. He pressed the bell, and the carriage drew up beside the curbstone. ""Why are we stopping? This is not Granny's,"" Madame Olenska exclaimed. ""No: I shall get out here,"" he stammered, opening the door and jumping to the pavement. By the light of a street-lamp he saw her startled face, and the instinctive motion she made to detain him. He closed the door, and leaned for a moment in the window. ""You're right: I ought not to have come today,"" he said, lowering his voice so that the coachman should not hear. She bent forward, and seemed about to speak; but he had already called out the order to drive on, and the carriage rolled away while he stood on the corner. The snow was over, and a tingling wind had sprung up, that lashed his face as he stood gazing. Suddenly he felt something stiff and cold on his lashes, and perceived that he had been crying, and that the wind had frozen his tears. He thrust his hands in his pockets, and walked at a sharp pace down Fifth Avenue to his own house.  XXX. That evening when Archer came down before dinner he found the drawing-room empty. He and May were dining alone, all the family engagements having been postponed since Mrs. Manson Mingott's illness; and as May was the more punctual of the two he was surprised that she had not preceded him. He knew that she was at home, for while he dressed he had heard her moving about in her room; and he wondered what had delayed her. He had fallen into the way of dwelling on such conjectures as a means of tying his thoughts fast to reality. Sometimes he felt as if he had found the clue to his father-in-law's absorption in trifles; perhaps even Mr. Welland, long ago, had had escapes and visions, and had conjured up all the hosts of domesticity to defend himself against them. When May appeared he thought she looked tired. She had put on the low-necked and tightly-laced dinner- dress which the Mingott ceremonial exacted on the most informal occasions, and had built her fair hair into its usual accumulated coils; and her face, in contrast, was wan and almost faded. But she shone on him with her usual tenderness, and her eyes had kept the blue dazzle of the day before. ""What became of you, dear?"" she asked. ""I was waiting at Granny's, and Ellen came alone, and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business. There's nothing wrong?"" ""Only some letters I'd forgotten, and wanted to get off before dinner."" ""Ah--"" she said; and a moment afterward: ""I'm sorry you didn't come to Granny's--unless the letters were urgent."" ""They were,"" he rejoined, surprised at her insistence. ""Besides, I don't see why I should have gone to your grandmother's. I didn't know you were there."" She turned and moved to the looking-glass above the mantel-piece. As she stood there, lifting her long arm to fasten a puff that had slipped from its place in her intricate hair, Archer was struck by something languid and inelastic in her attitude, and wondered if the deadly monotony of their lives had laid its weight on her also. Then he remembered that, as he had left the house that morning, she had called over the stairs that she would meet him at her grandmother's so that they might drive home together. He had called back a cheery ""Yes!"" and then, absorbed in other visions, had forgotten his promise. Now he was smitten with compunction, yet irritated that so trifling an omission should be stored up against him after nearly two years of marriage. He was weary of living in a perpetual tepid honeymoon, without the temperature of passion yet with all its exactions. If May had spoken out her grievances (he suspected her of many) he might have laughed them away; but she was trained to conceal imaginary wounds under a Spartan smile. To disguise his own annoyance he asked how her grandmother was, and she answered that Mrs. Mingott was still improving, but had been rather disturbed by the last news about the Beauforts. ""What news?"" ""It seems they're going to stay in New York. I believe he's going into an insurance business, or something. They're looking about for a small house."" The preposterousness of the case was beyond discussion, and they went in to dinner. During dinner their talk moved in its usual limited circle; but Archer noticed that his wife made no allusion to Madame Olenska, nor to old Catherine's reception of her. He was thankful for the fact, yet felt it to be vaguely ominous. They went up to the library for coffee, and Archer lit a cigar and took down a volume of Michelet. He had taken to history in the evenings since May had shown a tendency to ask him to read aloud whenever she saw him with a volume of poetry: not that he disliked the sound of his own voice, but because he could always foresee her comments on what he read. In the days of their engagement she had simply (as he now perceived) echoed what he told her; but since he had ceased to provide her with opinions she had begun to hazard her own, with results destructive to his enjoyment of the works commented on. Seeing that he had chosen history she fetched her workbasket, drew up an arm-chair to the green-shaded student lamp, and uncovered a cushion she was embroidering for his sofa. She was not a clever needle- woman; her large capable hands were made for riding, rowing and open-air activities; but since other wives embroidered cushions for their husbands she did not wish to omit this last link in her devotion. She was so placed that Archer, by merely raising his eyes, could see her bent above her work-frame, her ruffled elbow-sleeves slipping back from her firm round arms, the betrothal sapphire shining on her left hand above her broad gold wedding-ring, and the right hand slowly and laboriously stabbing the canvas. As she sat thus, the lamplight full on her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion. She had spent her poetry and romance on their short courting: the function was exhausted because the need was past. Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland. He laid down his book and stood up impatiently; and at once she raised her head. ""What's the matter?"" ""The room is stifling: I want a little air."" He had insisted that the library curtains should draw backward and forward on a rod, so that they might be closed in the evening, instead of remaining nailed to a gilt cornice, and immovably looped up over layers of lace, as in the drawing-room; and he pulled them back and pushed up the sash, leaning out into the icy night. The mere fact of not looking at May, seated beside his table, under his lamp, the fact of seeing other houses, roofs, chimneys, of getting the sense of other lives outside his own, other cities beyond New York, and a whole world beyond his world, cleared his brain and made it easier to breathe. After he had leaned out into the darkness for a few minutes he heard her say: ""Newland! Do shut the window. You'll catch your death."" He pulled the sash down and turned back. ""Catch my death!"" he echoed; and he felt like adding: ""But I've caught it already. I AM dead--I've been dead for months and months."" And suddenly the play of the word flashed up a wild suggestion. What if it were SHE who was dead! If she were going to die--to die soon--and leave him free! The sensation of standing there, in that warm familiar room, and looking at her, and wishing her dead, was so strange, so fascinating and overmastering, that its enormity did not immediately strike him. He simply felt that chance had given him a new possibility to which his sick soul might cling. Yes, May might die-- people did: young people, healthy people like herself: she might die, and set him suddenly free. She glanced up, and he saw by her widening eyes that there must be something strange in his own. ""Newland! Are you ill?"" He shook his head and turned toward his arm-chair. She bent over her work-frame, and as he passed he laid his hand on her hair. ""Poor May!"" he said. ""Poor? Why poor?"" she echoed with a strained laugh. ""Because I shall never be able to open a window without worrying you,"" he rejoined, laughing also. For a moment she was silent; then she said very low, her head bowed over her work: ""I shall never worry if you're happy."" ""Ah, my dear; and I shall never be happy unless I can open the windows!"" ""In THIS weather?"" she remonstrated; and with a sigh he buried his head in his book. Six or seven days passed. Archer heard nothing from Madame Olenska, and became aware that her name would not be mentioned in his presence by any member of the family. He did not try to see her; to do so while she was at old Catherine's guarded bedside would have been almost impossible. In the uncertainty of the situation he let himself drift, conscious, somewhere below the surface of his thoughts, of a resolve which had come to him when he had leaned out from his library window into the icy night. The strength of that resolve made it easy to wait and make no sign. Then one day May told him that Mrs. Manson Mingott had asked to see him. There was nothing surprising in the request, for the old lady was steadily recovering, and she had always openly declared that she preferred Archer to any of her other grandsons-in- law. May gave the message with evident pleasure: she was proud of old Catherine's appreciation of her husband. There was a moment's pause, and then Archer felt it incumbent on him to say: ""All right. Shall we go together this afternoon?"" His wife's face brightened, but she instantly answered: ""Oh, you'd much better go alone. It bores Granny to see the same people too often."" Archer's heart was beating violently when he rang old Mrs. Mingott's bell. He had wanted above all things to go alone, for he felt sure the visit would give him the chance of saying a word in private to the Countess Olenska. He had determined to wait till the chance presented itself naturally; and here it was, and here he was on the doorstep. Behind the door, behind the curtains of the yellow damask room next to the hall, she was surely awaiting him; in another moment he should see her, and be able to speak to her before she led him to the sick-room. He wanted only to put one question: after that his course would be clear. What he wished to ask was simply the date of her return to Washington; and that question she could hardly refuse to answer. But in the yellow sitting-room it was the mulatto maid who waited. Her white teeth shining like a keyboard, she pushed back the sliding doors and ushered him into old Catherine's presence. The old woman sat in a vast throne-like arm-chair near her bed. Beside her was a mahogany stand bearing a cast bronze lamp with an engraved globe, over which a green paper shade had been balanced. There was not a book or a newspaper in reach, nor any evidence of feminine employment: conversation had always been Mrs. Mingott's sole pursuit, and she would have scorned to feign an interest in fancywork. Archer saw no trace of the slight distortion left by her stroke. She merely looked paler, with darker shadows in the folds and recesses of her obesity; and, in the fluted mob-cap tied by a starched bow between her first two chins, and the muslin kerchief crossed over her billowing purple dressing-gown, she seemed like some shrewd and kindly ancestress of her own who might have yielded too freely to the pleasures of the table. She held out one of the little hands that nestled in a hollow of her huge lap like pet animals, and called to the maid: ""Don't let in any one else. If my daughters call, say I'm asleep."" The maid disappeared, and the old lady turned to her grandson. ""My dear, am I perfectly hideous?"" she asked gaily, launching out one hand in search of the folds of muslin on her inaccessible bosom. ""My daughters tell me it doesn't matter at my age--as if hideousness didn't matter all the more the harder it gets to conceal!"" ""My dear, you're handsomer than ever!"" Archer rejoined in the same tone; and she threw back her head and laughed. ""Ah, but not as handsome as Ellen!"" she jerked out, twinkling at him maliciously; and before he could answer she added: ""Was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry?"" He laughed, and she continued: ""Was it because you told her so that she had to put you out on the way? In my youth young men didn't desert pretty women unless they were made to!"" She gave another chuckle, and interrupted it to say almost querulously: ""It's a pity she didn't marry you; I always told her so. It would have spared me all this worry. But who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry?"" Archer wondered if her illness had blurred her faculties; but suddenly she broke out: ""Well, it's settled, anyhow: she's going to stay with me, whatever the rest of the family say! She hadn't been here five minutes before I'd have gone down on my knees to keep her--if only, for the last twenty years, I'd been able to see where the floor was!"" Archer listened in silence, and she went on: ""They'd talked me over, as no doubt you know: persuaded me, Lovell, and Letterblair, and Augusta Welland, and all the rest of them, that I must hold out and cut off her allowance, till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to Olenski. They thought they'd convinced me when the secretary, or whatever he was, came out with the last proposals: handsome proposals I confess they were. After all, marriage is marriage, and money's money--both useful things in their way . . . and I didn't know what to answer--"" She broke off and drew a long breath, as if speaking had become an effort. ""But the minute I laid eyes on her, I said: `You sweet bird, you! Shut you up in that cage again? Never!' And now it's settled that she's to stay here and nurse her Granny as long as there's a Granny to nurse. It's not a gay prospect, but she doesn't mind; and of course I've told Letterblair that she's to be given her proper allowance."" The young man heard her with veins aglow; but in his confusion of mind he hardly knew whether her news brought joy or pain. He had so definitely decided on the course he meant to pursue that for the moment he could not readjust his thoughts. But gradually there stole over him the delicious sense of difficulties deferred and opportunities miraculously provided. If Ellen had consented to come and live with her grandmother it must surely be because she had recognised the impossibility of giving him up. This was her answer to his final appeal of the other day: if she would not take the extreme step he had urged, she had at last yielded to half-measures. He sank back into the thought with the involuntary relief of a man who has been ready to risk everything, and suddenly tastes the dangerous sweetness of security. ""She couldn't have gone back--it was impossible!"" he exclaimed. ""Ah, my dear, I always knew you were on her side; and that's why I sent for you today, and why I said to your pretty wife, when she proposed to come with you: `No, my dear, I'm pining to see Newland, and I don't want anybody to share our transports.' For you see, my dear--"" she drew her head back as far as its tethering chins permitted, and looked him full in the eyes--""you see, we shall have a fight yet. The family don't want her here, and they'll say it's because I've been ill, because I'm a weak old woman, that she's persuaded me. I'm not well enough yet to fight them one by one, and you've got to do it for me."" ""I?"" he stammered. ""You. Why not?"" she jerked back at him, her round eyes suddenly as sharp as pen-knives. Her hand fluttered from its chair-arm and lit on his with a clutch of little pale nails like bird-claws. ""Why not?"" she searchingly repeated. Archer, under the exposure of her gaze, had recovered his self-possession. ""Oh, I don't count--I'm too insignificant."" ""Well, you're Letterblair's partner, ain't you? You've got to get at them through Letterblair. Unless you've got a reason,"" she insisted. ""Oh, my dear, I back you to hold your own against them all without my help; but you shall have it if you need it,"" he reassured her. ""Then we're safe!"" she sighed; and smiling on him with all her ancient cunning she added, as she settled her head among the cushions: ""I always knew you'd back us up, because they never quote you when they talk about its being her duty to go home."" He winced a little at her terrifying perspicacity, and longed to ask: ""And May--do they quote her?"" But he judged it safer to turn the question. ""And Madame Olenska? When am I to see her?"" he said. The old lady chuckled, crumpled her lids, and went through the pantomime of archness. ""Not today. One at a time, please. Madame Olenska's gone out."" He flushed with disappointment, and she went on: ""She's gone out, my child: gone in my carriage to see Regina Beaufort."" She paused for this announcement to produce its effect. ""That's what she's reduced me to already. The day after she got here she put on her best bonnet, and told me, as cool as a cucumber, that she was going to call on Regina Beaufort. `I don't know her; who is she?' says I. `She's your grand-niece, and a most unhappy woman,' she says. `She's the wife of a scoundrel,' I answered. `Well,' she says, `and so am I, and yet all my family want me to go back to him.' Well, that floored me, and I let her go; and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot, and she wanted me to lend her my carriage. `What for?' I asked her; and she said: `To go and see cousin Regina--COUSIN! Now, my dear, I looked out of the window, and saw it wasn't raining a drop; but I understood her, and I let her have the carriage. . . . After all, Regina's a brave woman, and so is she; and I've always liked courage above everything."" Archer bent down and pressed his lips on the little hand that still lay on his. ""Eh--eh--eh! Whose hand did you think you were kissing, young man--your wife's, I hope?"" the old lady snapped out with her mocking cackle; and as he rose to go she called out after him: ""Give her her Granny's love; but you'd better not say anything about our talk.""  XXXI. Archer had been stunned by old Catherine's news. It was only natural that Madame Olenska should have hastened from Washington in response to her grandmother's summons; but that she should have decided to remain under her roof--especially now that Mrs. Mingott had almost regained her health--was less easy to explain. Archer was sure that Madame Olenska's decision had not been influenced by the change in her financial situation. He knew the exact figure of the small income which her husband had allowed her at their separation. Without the addition of her grandmother's allowance it was hardly enough to live on, in any sense known to the Mingott vocabulary; and now that Medora Manson, who shared her life, had been ruined, such a pittance would barely keep the two women clothed and fed. Yet Archer was convinced that Madame Olenska had not accepted her grandmother's offer from interested motives. She had the heedless generosity and the spasmodic extravagance of persons used to large fortunes, and indifferent to money; but she could go without many things which her relations considered indispensable, and Mrs. Lovell Mingott and Mrs. Welland had often been heard to deplore that any one who had enjoyed the cosmopolitan luxuries of Count Olenski's establishments should care so little about ""how things were done."" Moreover, as Archer knew, several months had passed since her allowance had been cut off; yet in the interval she had made no effort to regain her grand- mother's favour. Therefore if she had changed her course it must be for a different reason. He did not have far to seek for that reason. On the way from the ferry she had told him that he and she must remain apart; but she had said it with her head on his breast. He knew that there was no calculated coquetry in her words; she was fighting her fate as he had fought his, and clinging desperately to her resolve that they should not break faith with the people who trusted them. But during the ten days which had elapsed since her return to New York she had perhaps guessed from his silence, and from the fact of his making no attempt to see her, that he was meditating a decisive step, a step from which there was no turning back. At the thought, a sudden fear of her own weakness might have seized her, and she might have felt that, after all, it was better to accept the compromise usual in such cases, and follow the line of least resistance. An hour earlier, when he had rung Mrs. Mingott's bell, Archer had fancied that his path was clear before him. He had meant to have a word alone with Madame Olenska, and failing that, to learn from her grandmother on what day, and by which train, she was returning to Washington. In that train he intended to join her, and travel with her to Washington, or as much farther as she was willing to go. His own fancy inclined to Japan. At any rate she would understand at once that, wherever she went, he was going. He meant to leave a note for May that should cut off any other alternative. He had fancied himself not only nerved for this plunge but eager to take it; yet his first feeling on hearing that the course of events was changed had been one of relief. Now, however, as he walked home from Mrs. Mingott's, he was conscious of a growing distaste for what lay before him. There was nothing unknown or unfamiliar in the path he was presumably to tread; but when he had trodden it before it was as a free man, who was accountable to no one for his actions, and could lend himself with an amused detachment to the game of precautions and prevarications, concealments and compliances, that the part required. This procedure was called ""protecting a woman's honour""; and the best fiction, combined with the after-dinner talk of his elders, had long since initiated him into every detail of its code. Now he saw the matter in a new light, and his part in it seemed singularly diminished. It was, in fact, that which, with a secret fatuity, he had watched Mrs. Thorley Rushworth play toward a fond and unperceiving husband: a smiling, bantering, humouring, watchful and incessant lie. A lie by day, a lie by night, a lie in every touch and every look; a lie in every caress and every quarrel; a lie in every word and in every silence. It was easier, and less dastardly on the whole, for a wife to play such a part toward her husband. A woman's standard of truthfulness was tacitly held to be lower: she was the subject creature, and versed in the arts of the enslaved. Then she could always plead moods and nerves, and the right not to be held too strictly to account; and even in the most strait-laced societies the laugh was always against the husband. But in Archer's little world no one laughed at a wife deceived, and a certain measure of contempt was attached to men who continued their philandering after marriage. In the rotation of crops there was a recognised season for wild oats; but they were not to be sown more than once. Archer had always shared this view: in his heart he thought Lefferts despicable. But to love Ellen Olenska was not to become a man like Lefferts: for the first time Archer found himself face to face with the dread argument of the individual case. Ellen Olenska was like no other woman, he was like no other man: their situation, therefore, resembled no one else's, and they were answerable to no tribunal but that of their own judgment. Yes, but in ten minutes more he would be mounting his own doorstep; and there were May, and habit, and honour, and all the old decencies that he and his people had always believed in . . . At his corner he hesitated, and then walked on down Fifth Avenue. Ahead of him, in the winter night, loomed a big unlit house. As he drew near he thought how often he had seen it blazing with lights, its steps awninged and carpeted, and carriages waiting in double line to draw up at the curbstone. It was in the conservatory that stretched its dead-black bulk down the side street that he had taken his first kiss from May; it was under the myriad candles of the ball-room that he had seen her appear, tall and silver-shining as a young Diana. Now the house was as dark as the grave, except for a faint flare of gas in the basement, and a light in one upstairs room where the blind had not been lowered. As Archer reached the corner he saw that the carriage standing at the door was Mrs. Manson Mingott's. What an opportunity for Sillerton Jackson, if he should chance to pass! Archer had been greatly moved by old Catherine's account of Madame Olenska's attitude toward Mrs. Beaufort; it made the righteous reprobation of New York seem like a passing by on the other side. But he knew well enough what construction the clubs and drawing-rooms would put on Ellen Olenska's visits to her cousin. He paused and looked up at the lighted window. No doubt the two women were sitting together in that room: Beaufort had probably sought consolation elsewhere. There were even rumours that he had left New York with Fanny Ring; but Mrs. Beaufort's attitude made the report seem improbable. Archer had the nocturnal perspective of Fifth Avenue almost to himself. At that hour most people were indoors, dressing for dinner; and he was secretly glad that Ellen's exit was likely to be unobserved. As the thought passed through his mind the door opened, and she came out. Behind her was a faint light, such as might have been carried down the stairs to show her the way. She turned to say a word to some one; then the door closed, and she came down the steps. ""Ellen,"" he said in a low voice, as she reached the pavement. She stopped with a slight start, and just then he saw two young men of fashionable cut approaching. There was a familiar air about their overcoats and the way their smart silk mufflers were folded over their white ties; and he wondered how youths of their quality happened to be dining out so early. Then he remembered that the Reggie Chiverses, whose house was a few doors above, were taking a large party that evening to see Adelaide Neilson in Romeo and Juliet, and guessed that the two were of the number. They passed under a lamp, and he recognised Lawrence Lefferts and a young Chivers. A mean desire not to have Madame Olenska seen at the Beauforts' door vanished as he felt the penetrating warmth of her hand. ""I shall see you now--we shall be together,"" he broke out, hardly knowing what he said. ""Ah,"" she answered, ""Granny has told you?"" While he watched her he was aware that Lefferts and Chivers, on reaching the farther side of the street corner, had discreetly struck away across Fifth Avenue. It was the kind of masculine solidarity that he himself often practised; now he sickened at their connivance. Did she really imagine that he and she could live like this? And if not, what else did she imagine? ""Tomorrow I must see you--somewhere where we can be alone,"" he said, in a voice that sounded almost angry to his own ears. She wavered, and moved toward the carriage. ""But I shall be at Granny's--for the present that is,"" she added, as if conscious that her change of plans required some explanation. ""Somewhere where we can be alone,"" he insisted. She gave a faint laugh that grated on him. ""In New York? But there are no churches . . . no monuments."" ""There's the Art Museum--in the Park,"" he explained, as she looked puzzled. ""At half-past two. I shall be at the door . . ."" She turned away without answering and got quickly into the carriage. As it drove off she leaned forward, and he thought she waved her hand in the obscurity. He stared after her in a turmoil of contradictory feelings. It seemed to him that he had been speaking not to the woman he loved but to another, a woman he was indebted to for pleasures already wearied of: it was hateful to find himself the prisoner of this hackneyed vocabulary. ""She'll come!"" he said to himself, almost contemptuously. Avoiding the popular ""Wolfe collection,"" whose anecdotic canvases filled one of the main galleries of the queer wilderness of cast-iron and encaustic tiles known as the Metropolitan Museum, they had wandered down a passage to the room where the ""Cesnola antiquities"" mouldered in unvisited loneliness. They had this melancholy retreat to themselves, and seated on the divan enclosing the central steam-radiator, they were staring silently at the glass cabinets mounted in ebonised wood which contained the recovered fragments of Ilium. ""It's odd,"" Madame Olenska said, ""I never came here before."" ""Ah, well--. Some day, I suppose, it will be a great Museum."" ""Yes,"" she assented absently. She stood up and wandered across the room. Archer, remaining seated, watched the light movements of her figure, so girlish even under its heavy furs, the cleverly planted heron wing in her fur cap, and the way a dark curl lay like a flattened vine spiral on each cheek above the ear. His mind, as always when they first met, was wholly absorbed in the delicious details that made her herself and no other. Presently he rose and approached the case before which she stood. Its glass shelves were crowded with small broken objects--hardly recognisable domestic utensils, ornaments and personal trifles--made of glass, of clay, of discoloured bronze and other time- blurred substances. ""It seems cruel,"" she said, ""that after a while nothing matters . . . any more than these little things, that used to be necessary and important to forgotten people, and now have to be guessed at under a magnifying glass and labelled: `Use unknown.'"" ""Yes; but meanwhile--"" ""Ah, meanwhile--"" As she stood there, in her long sealskin coat, her hands thrust in a small round muff, her veil drawn down like a transparent mask to the tip of her nose, and the bunch of violets he had brought her stirring with her quickly-taken breath, it seemed incredible that this pure harmony of line and colour should ever suffer the stupid law of change. ""Meanwhile everything matters--that concerns you,"" he said. She looked at him thoughtfully, and turned back to the divan. He sat down beside her and waited; but suddenly he heard a step echoing far off down the empty rooms, and felt the pressure of the minutes. ""What is it you wanted to tell me?"" she asked, as if she had received the same warning. ""What I wanted to tell you?"" he rejoined. ""Why, that I believe you came to New York because you were afraid."" ""Afraid?"" ""Of my coming to Washington."" She looked down at her muff, and he saw her hands stir in it uneasily. ""Well--?"" ""Well--yes,"" she said. ""You WERE afraid? You knew--?"" ""Yes: I knew . . ."" ""Well, then?"" he insisted. ""Well, then: this is better, isn't it?"" she returned with a long questioning sigh. ""Better--?"" ""We shall hurt others less. Isn't it, after all, what you always wanted?"" ""To have you here, you mean--in reach and yet out of reach? To meet you in this way, on the sly? It's the very reverse of what I want. I told you the other day what I wanted."" She hesitated. ""And you still think this--worse?"" ""A thousand times!"" He paused. ""It would be easy to lie to you; but the truth is I think it detestable."" ""Oh, so do I!"" she cried with a deep breath of relief. He sprang up impatiently. ""Well, then--it's my turn to ask: what is it, in God's name, that you think better?"" She hung her head and continued to clasp and unclasp her hands in her muff. The step drew nearer, and a guardian in a braided cap walked listlessly through the room like a ghost stalking through a necropolis. They fixed their eyes simultaneously on the case opposite them, and when the official figure had vanished down a vista of mummies and sarcophagi Archer spoke again. ""What do you think better?"" Instead of answering she murmured: ""I promised Granny to stay with her because it seemed to me that here I should be safer."" ""From me?"" She bent her head slightly, without looking at him. ""Safer from loving me?"" Her profile did not stir, but he saw a tear overflow on her lashes and hang in a mesh of her veil. ""Safer from doing irreparable harm. Don't let us be like all the others!"" she protested. ""What others? I don't profess to be different from my kind. I'm consumed by the same wants and the same longings."" She glanced at him with a kind of terror, and he saw a faint colour steal into her cheeks. ""Shall I--once come to you; and then go home?"" she suddenly hazarded in a low clear voice. The blood rushed to the young man's forehead. ""Dearest!"" he said, without moving. It seemed as if he held his heart in his hands, like a full cup that the least motion might overbrim. Then her last phrase struck his ear and his face clouded. ""Go home? What do you mean by going home?"" Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton ""Home to my husband."" ""And you expect me to say yes to that?"" She raised her troubled eyes to his. ""What else is there? I can't stay here and lie to the people who've been good to me."" ""But that's the very reason why I ask you to come away!"" ""And destroy their lives, when they've helped me to remake mine?"" Archer sprang to his feet and stood looking down on her in inarticulate despair. It would have been easy to say: ""Yes, come; come once."" He knew the power she would put in his hands if she consented; there would be no difficulty then in persuading her not to go back to her husband. But something silenced the word on his lips. A sort of passionate honesty in her made it inconceivable that he should try to draw her into that familiar trap. ""If I were to let her come,"" he said to himself, ""I should have to let her go again."" And that was not to be imagined. But he saw the shadow of the lashes on her wet cheek, and wavered. ""After all,"" he began again, ""we have lives of our own. . . . There's no use attempting the impossible. You're so unprejudiced about some things, so used, as you say, to looking at the Gorgon, that I don't know why you're afraid to face our case, and see it as it really is--unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making."" She stood up also, her lips tightening under a rapid frown. ""Call it that, then--I must go,"" she said, drawing her little watch from her bosom. She turned away, and he followed and caught her by the wrist. ""Well, then: come to me once,"" he said, his head turning suddenly at the thought of losing her; and for a second or two they looked at each other almost like enemies. ""When?"" he insisted. ""Tomorrow?"" She hesitated. ""The day after."" ""Dearest--!"" he said again. She had disengaged her wrist; but for a moment they continued to hold each other's eyes, and he saw that her face, which had grown very pale, was flooded with a deep inner radiance. His heart beat with awe: he felt that he had never before beheld love visible. ""Oh, I shall be late--good-bye. No, don't come any farther than this,"" she cried, walking hurriedly away down the long room, as if the reflected radiance in his eyes had frightened her. When she reached the door she turned for a moment to wave a quick farewell. Archer walked home alone. Darkness was falling when he let himself into his house, and he looked about at the familiar objects in the hall as if he viewed them from the other side of the grave. The parlour-maid, hearing his step, ran up the stairs to light the gas on the upper landing. ""Is Mrs. Archer in?"" ""No, sir; Mrs. Archer went out in the carriage after luncheon, and hasn't come back."" With a sense of relief he entered the library and flung himself down in his armchair. The parlour-maid followed, bringing the student lamp and shaking some coals onto the dying fire. When she left he continued to sit motionless, his elbows on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands, his eyes fixed on the red grate. He sat there without conscious thoughts, without sense of the lapse of time, in a deep and grave amazement that seemed to suspend life rather than quicken it. ""This was what had to be, then . . . this was what had to be,"" he kept repeating to himself, as if he hung in the clutch of doom. What he had dreamed of had been so different that there was a mortal chill in his rapture. The door opened and May came in. ""I'm dreadfully late--you weren't worried, were you?"" she asked, laying her hand on his shoulder with one of her rare caresses. He looked up astonished. ""Is it late?"" ""After seven. I believe you've been asleep!"" She laughed, and drawing out her hat pins tossed her velvet hat on the sofa. She looked paler than usual, but sparkling with an unwonted animation. ""I went to see Granny, and just as I was going away Ellen came in from a walk; so I stayed and had a long talk with her. It was ages since we'd had a real talk. . . ."" She had dropped into her usual armchair, facing his, and was running her fingers through her rumpled hair. He fancied she expected him to speak. ""A really good talk,"" she went on, smiling with what seemed to Archer an unnatural vividness. ""She was so dear--just like the old Ellen. I'm afraid I haven't been fair to her lately. I've sometimes thought--"" Archer stood up and leaned against the mantelpiece, out of the radius of the lamp. ""Yes, you've thought--?"" he echoed as she paused. ""Well, perhaps I haven't judged her fairly. She's so different--at least on the surface. She takes up such odd people--she seems to like to make herself conspicuous. I suppose it's the life she's led in that fast European society; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her. But I don't want to judge her unfairly."" She paused again, a little breathless with the unwonted length of her speech, and sat with her lips slightly parted and a deep blush on her cheeks. Archer, as he looked at her, was reminded of the glow which had suffused her face in the Mission Garden at St. Augustine. He became aware of the same obscure effort in her, the same reaching out toward something beyond the usual range of her vision. ""She hates Ellen,"" he thought, ""and she's trying to overcome the feeling, and to get me to help her to overcome it."" The thought moved him, and for a moment he was on the point of breaking the silence between them, and throwing himself on her mercy. ""You understand, don't you,"" she went on, ""why the family have sometimes been annoyed? We all did what we could for her at first; but she never seemed to understand. And now this idea of going to see Mrs. Beaufort, of going there in Granny's carriage! I'm afraid she's quite alienated the van der Luydens . . ."" ""Ah,"" said Archer with an impatient laugh. The open door had closed between them again. ""It's time to dress; we're dining out, aren't we?"" he asked, moving from the fire. She rose also, but lingered near the hearth. As he walked past her she moved forward impulsively, as though to detain him: their eyes met, and he saw that hers were of the same swimming blue as when he had left her to drive to Jersey City. She flung her arms about his neck and pressed her cheek to his. ""You haven't kissed me today,"" she said in a whisper; and he felt her tremble in his arms.  XXXII. At the court of the Tuileries,"" said Mr. Sillerton Jackson with his reminiscent smile, ""such things were pretty openly tolerated."" The scene was the van der Luydens' black walnut dining-room in Madison Avenue, and the time the evening after Newland Archer's visit to the Museum of Art. Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden had come to town for a few days from Skuytercliff, whither they had precipitately fled at the announcement of Beaufort's failure. It had been represented to them that the disarray into which society had been thrown by this deplorable affair made their presence in town more necessary than ever. It was one of the occasions when, as Mrs. Archer put it, they ""owed it to society"" to show themselves at the Opera, and even to open their own doors. ""It will never do, my dear Louisa, to let people like Mrs. Lemuel Struthers think they can step into Regina's shoes. It is just at such times that new people push in and get a footing. It was owing to the epidemic of chicken-pox in New York the winter Mrs. Struthers first appeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their wives were in the nursery. You and dear Henry, Louisa, must stand in the breach as you always have."" Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden could not remain deaf to such a call, and reluctantly but heroically they had come to town, unmuffled the house, and sent out invitations for two dinners and an evening reception. On this particular evening they had invited Sillerton Jackson, Mrs. Archer and Newland and his wife to go with them to the Opera, where Faust was being sung for the first time that winter. Nothing was done without ceremony under the van der Luyden roof, and though there were but four guests the repast had begun at seven punctually, so that the proper sequence of courses might be served without haste before the gentlemen settled down to their cigars. Archer had not seen his wife since the evening before. He had left early for the office, where he had plunged into an accumulation of unimportant business. In the afternoon one of the senior partners had made an unexpected call on his time; and he had reached home so late that May had preceded him to the van der Luydens', and sent back the carriage. Now, across the Skuytercliff carnations and the massive plate, she struck him as pale and languid; but her eyes shone, and she talked with exaggerated animation. The subject which had called forth Mr. Sillerton Jackson's favourite allusion had been brought up (Archer fancied not without intention) by their hostess. The Beaufort failure, or rather the Beaufort attitude since the failure, was still a fruitful theme for the drawing- room moralist; and after it had been thoroughly examined and condemned Mrs. van der Luyden had turned her scrupulous eyes on May Archer. ""Is it possible, dear, that what I hear is true? I was told your grandmother Mingott's carriage was seen standing at Mrs. Beaufort's door."" It was noticeable that she no longer called the offending lady by her Christian name. May's colour rose, and Mrs. Archer put in hastily: ""If it was, I'm convinced it was there without Mrs. Mingott's knowledge."" ""Ah, you think--?"" Mrs. van der Luyden paused, sighed, and glanced at her husband. ""I'm afraid,"" Mr. van der Luyden said, ""that Madame Olenska's kind heart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on Mrs. Beaufort."" ""Or her taste for peculiar people,"" put in Mrs. Archer in a dry tone, while her eyes dwelt innocently on her son's. ""I'm sorry to think it of Madame Olenska,"" said Mrs. van der Luyden; and Mrs. Archer murmured: ""Ah, my dear--and after you'd had her twice at Skuytercliff!"" It was at this point that Mr. Jackson seized the chance to place his favourite allusion. ""At the Tuileries,"" he repeated, seeing the eyes of the company expectantly turned on him, ""the standard was excessively lax in some respects; and if you'd asked where Morny's money came from--! Or who paid the debts of some of the Court beauties . . ."" ""I hope, dear Sillerton,"" said Mrs. Archer, ""you are not suggesting that we should adopt such standards?"" ""I never suggest,"" returned Mr. Jackson imperturbably. ""But Madame Olenska's foreign bringing-up may make her less particular--"" ""Ah,"" the two elder ladies sighed. ""Still, to have kept her grandmother's carriage at a defaulter's door!"" Mr. van der Luyden protested; and Archer guessed that he was remembering, and resenting, the hampers of carnations he had sent to the little house in Twenty-third Street. ""Of course I've always said that she looks at things quite differently,"" Mrs. Archer summed up. A flush rose to May's forehead. She looked across the table at her husband, and said precipitately: ""I'm sure Ellen meant it kindly."" ""Imprudent people are often kind,"" said Mrs. Archer, as if the fact were scarcely an extenuation; and Mrs. van der Luyden murmured: ""If only she had consulted some one--"" ""Ah, that she never did!"" Mrs. Archer rejoined. At this point Mr. van der Luyden glanced at his wife, who bent her head slightly in the direction of Mrs. Archer; and the glimmering trains of the three ladies swept out of the door while the gentlemen settled down to their cigars. Mr. van der Luyden supplied short ones on Opera nights; but they were so good that they made his guests deplore his inexorable punctuality. Archer, after the first act, had detached himself from the party and made his way to the back of the club box. From there he watched, over various Chivers, Mingott and Rushworth shoulders, the same scene that he had looked at, two years previously, on the night of his first meeting with Ellen Olenska. He had half- expected her to appear again in old Mrs. Mingott's box, but it remained empty; and he sat motionless, his eyes fastened on it, till suddenly Madame Nilsson's pure soprano broke out into ""M'ama, non m'ama . . . "" Archer turned to the stage, where, in the familiar setting of giant roses and pen-wiper pansies, the same large blonde victim was succumbing to the same small brown seducer. From the stage his eyes wandered to the point of the horseshoe where May sat between two older ladies, just as, on that former evening, she had sat between Mrs. Lovell Mingott and her newly-arrived ""foreign"" cousin. As on that evening, she was all in white; and Archer, who had not noticed what she wore, recognised the blue-white satin and old lace of her wedding dress. It was the custom, in old New York, for brides to appear in this costly garment during the first year or two of marriage: his mother, he knew, kept hers in tissue paper in the hope that Janey might some day wear it, though poor Janey was reaching the age when pearl grey poplin and no bridesmaids would be thought more ""appropriate."" It struck Archer that May, since their return from Europe, had seldom worn her bridal satin, and the surprise of seeing her in it made him compare her appearance with that of the young girl he had watched with such blissful anticipations two years earlier. Though May's outline was slightly heavier, as her goddesslike build had foretold, her athletic erectness of carriage, and the girlish transparency of her expression, remained unchanged: but for the slight languor that Archer had lately noticed in her she would have been the exact image of the girl playing with the bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley on her betrothal evening. The fact seemed an additional appeal to his pity: such innocence was as moving as the trustful clasp of a child. Then he remembered the passionate generosity latent under that incurious calm. He recalled her glance of understanding when he had urged that their engagement should be announced at the Beaufort ball; he heard the voice in which she had said, in the Mission garden: ""I couldn't have my happiness made out of a wrong--a wrong to some one else;"" and an uncontrollable longing seized him to tell her the truth, to throw himself on her generosity, and ask for the freedom he had once refused. Newland Archer was a quiet and self-controlled young man. Conformity to the discipline of a small society had become almost his second nature. It was deeply distasteful to him to do anything melodramatic and conspicuous, anything Mr. van der Luyden would have deprecated and the club box condemned as bad form. But he had become suddenly unconscious of the club box, of Mr. van der Luyden, of all that had so long enclosed him in the warm shelter of habit. He walked along the semi-circular passage at the back of the house, and opened the door of Mrs. van der Luyden's box as if it had been a gate into the unknown. ""M'ama!"" thrilled out the triumphant Marguerite; and the occupants of the box looked up in surprise at Archer's entrance. He had already broken one of the rules of his world, which forbade the entering of a box during a solo. Slipping between Mr. van der Luyden and Sillerton Jackson, he leaned over his wife. ""I've got a beastly headache; don't tell any one, but come home, won't you?"" he whispered. May gave him a glance of comprehension, and he saw her whisper to his mother, who nodded sympathetically; then she murmured an excuse to Mrs. van der Luyden, and rose from her seat just as Marguerite fell into Faust's arms. Archer, while he helped her on with her Opera cloak, noticed the exchange of a significant smile between the older ladies. As they drove away May laid her hand shyly on his. ""I'm so sorry you don't feel well. I'm afraid they've been overworking you again at the office."" ""No--it's not that: do you mind if I open the window?"" he returned confusedly, letting down the pane on his side. He sat staring out into the street, feeling his wife beside him as a silent watchful interrogation, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the passing houses. At their door she caught her skirt in the step of the carriage, and fell against him. ""Did you hurt yourself?"" he asked, steadying her with his arm. ""No; but my poor dress--see how I've torn it!"" she exclaimed. She bent to gather up a mud-stained breadth, and followed him up the steps into the hall. The servants had not expected them so early, and there was only a glimmer of gas on the upper landing. Archer mounted the stairs, turned up the light, and put a match to the brackets on each side of the library mantelpiece. The curtains were drawn, and the warm friendly aspect of the room smote him like that of a familiar face met during an unavowable errand. He noticed that his wife was very pale, and asked if he should get her some brandy. ""Oh, no,"" she exclaimed with a momentary flush, as she took off her cloak. ""But hadn't you better go to bed at once?"" she added, as he opened a silver box on the table and took out a cigarette. Archer threw down the cigarette and walked to his usual place by the fire. ""No; my head is not as bad as that."" He paused. ""And there's something I want to say; something important--that I must tell you at once."" She had dropped into an armchair, and raised her head as he spoke. ""Yes, dear?"" she rejoined, so gently that he wondered at the lack of wonder with which she received this preamble. ""May--"" he began, standing a few feet from her chair, and looking over at her as if the slight distance between them were an unbridgeable abyss. The sound of his voice echoed uncannily through the homelike hush, and he repeated: ""There is something I've got to tell you . . . about myself . . ."" She sat silent, without a movement or a tremor of her lashes. She was still extremely pale, but her face had a curious tranquillity of expression that seemed drawn from some secret inner source. Archer checked the conventional phrases of self-accusal that were crowding to his lips. He was determined to put the case baldly, without vain recrimination or excuse. ""Madame Olenska--"" he said; but at the name his wife raised her hand as if to silence him. As she did so the gaslight struck on the gold of her wedding-ring, ""Oh, why should we talk about Ellen tonight?"" she asked, with a slight pout of impatience. ""Because I ought to have spoken before."" Her face remained calm. ""Is it really worth while, dear? I know I've been unfair to her at times--perhaps we all have. You've understood her, no doubt, better than we did: you've always been kind to her. But what does it matter, now it's all over?"" Archer looked at her blankly. Could it be possible that the sense of unreality in which he felt himself imprisoned had communicated itself to his wife? ""All over--what do you mean?"" he asked in an indistinct stammer. May still looked at him with transparent eyes. ""Why-- since she's going back to Europe so soon; since Granny approves and understands, and has arranged to make her independent of her husband--"" She broke off, and Archer, grasping the corner of the mantelpiece in one convulsed hand, and steadying himself against it, made a vain effort to extend the same control to his reeling thoughts. ""I supposed,"" he heard his wife's even voice go on, ""that you had been kept at the office this evening about the business arrangements. It was settled this morning, I believe."" She lowered her eyes under his unseeing stare, and another fugitive flush passed over her face. He understood that his own eyes must be unbearable, and turning away, rested his elbows on the mantel- shelf and covered his face. Something drummed and clanged furiously in his ears; he could not tell if it were the blood in his veins, or the tick of the clock on the mantel. May sat without moving or speaking while the clock slowly measured out five minutes. A lump of coal fell forward in the grate, and hearing her rise to push it back, Archer at length turned and faced her. ""It's impossible,"" he exclaimed. ""Impossible--?"" ""How do you know--what you've just told me?"" ""I saw Ellen yesterday--I told you I'd seen her at Granny's."" ""It wasn't then that she told you?"" ""No; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it?"" He could not find his voice, and she went out of the room, and came back almost immediately. ""I thought you knew,"" she said simply. She laid a sheet of paper on the table, and Archer put out his hand and took it up. The letter contained only a few lines. ""May dear, I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit; and she has been as kind and generous as ever. She sees now that if I return to Europe I must live by myself, or rather with poor Aunt Medora, who is coming with me. I am hurrying back to Washington to pack up, and we sail next week. You must be very good to Granny when I'm gone--as good as you've always been to me. Ellen. ""If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind, please tell them it would be utterly useless."" Archer read the letter over two or three times; then he flung it down and burst out laughing. The sound of his laugh startled him. It recalled Janey's midnight fright when she had caught him rocking with incomprehensible mirth over May's telegram announcing that the date of their marriage had been advanced. ""Why did she write this?"" he asked, checking his laugh with a supreme effort. May met the question with her unshaken candour. ""I suppose because we talked things over yesterday--"" ""What things?"" ""I told her I was afraid I hadn't been fair to her-- hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here, alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers; who felt the right to criticise, and yet didn't always know the circumstances."" She paused. ""I knew you'd been the one friend she could always count on; and I wanted her to know that you and I were the same--in all our feelings."" She hesitated, as if waiting for him to speak, and then added slowly: ""She understood my wishing to tell her this. I think she understands everything."" She went up to Archer, and taking one of his cold hands pressed it quickly against her cheek. ""My head aches too; good-night, dear,"" she said, and turned to the door, her torn and muddy wedding- dress dragging after her across the room.  XXXIII. It was, as Mrs. Archer smilingly said to Mrs. Welland, a great event for a young couple to give their first big dinner. The Newland Archers, since they had set up their household, had received a good deal of company in an informal way. Archer was fond of having three or four friends to dine, and May welcomed them with the beaming readiness of which her mother had set her the example in conjugal affairs. Her husband questioned whether, if left to herself, she would ever have asked any one to the house; but he had long given up trying to disengage her real self from the shape into which tradition and training had moulded her. It was expected that well-off young couples in New York should do a good deal of informal entertaining, and a Welland married to an Archer was doubly pledged to the tradition. But a big dinner, with a hired chef and two borrowed footmen, with Roman punch, roses from Henderson's, and menus on gilt-edged cards, was a different affair, and not to be lightly undertaken. As Mrs. Archer remarked, the Roman punch made all the difference; not in itself but by its manifold implications--since it signified either canvas-backs or terrapin, two soups, a hot and a cold sweet, full decolletage with short sleeves, and guests of a proportionate importance. It was always an interesting occasion when a young pair launched their first invitations in the third person, and their summons was seldom refused even by the seasoned and sought-after. Still, it was admittedly a triumph that the van der Luydens, at May's request, should have stayed over in order to be present at her farewell dinner for the Countess Olenska. The two mothers-in-law sat in May's drawing-room on the afternoon of the great day, Mrs. Archer writing out the menus on Tiffany's thickest gilt-edged bristol, while Mrs. Welland superintended the placing of the palms and standard lamps. Archer, arriving late from his office, found them still there. Mrs. Archer had turned her attention to the name-cards for the table, and Mrs. Welland was considering the effect of bringing forward the large gilt sofa, so that another ""corner"" might be created between the piano and the window. May, they told him, was in the dining-room inspecting the mound of Jacqueminot roses and maidenhair in the centre of the long table, and the placing of the Maillard bonbons in openwork silver baskets between the candelabra. On the piano stood a large basket of orchids which Mr. van der Luyden had had sent from Skuytercliff. Everything was, in short, as it should be on the approach of so considerable an event. Mrs. Archer ran thoughtfully over the list, checking off each name with her sharp gold pen. ""Henry van der Luyden--Louisa--the Lovell Mingotts --the Reggie Chiverses--Lawrence Lefferts and Gertrude--(yes, I suppose May was right to have them)--the Selfridge Merrys, Sillerton Jackson, Van Newland and his wife. (How time passes! It seems only yesterday that he was your best man, Newland)--and Countess Olenska--yes, I think that's all. . . ."" Mrs. Welland surveyed her son-in-law affectionately. ""No one can say, Newland, that you and May are not giving Ellen a handsome send-off."" ""Ah, well,"" said Mrs. Archer, ""I understand May's wanting her cousin to tell people abroad that we're not quite barbarians."" ""I'm sure Ellen will appreciate it. She was to arrive this morning, I believe. It will make a most charming last impression. The evening before sailing is usually so dreary,"" Mrs. Welland cheerfully continued. Archer turned toward the door, and his mother-in- law called to him: ""Do go in and have a peep at the table. And don't let May tire herself too much."" But he affected not to hear, and sprang up the stairs to his library. The room looked at him like an alien countenance composed into a polite grimace; and he perceived that it had been ruthlessly ""tidied,"" and prepared, by a judicious distribution of ash-trays and cedar-wood boxes, for the gentlemen to smoke in. ""Ah, well,"" he thought, ""it's not for long--"" and he went on to his dressing-room. Ten days had passed since Madame Olenska's departure from New York. During those ten days Archer had had no sign from her but that conveyed by the return of a key wrapped in tissue paper, and sent to his office in a sealed envelope addressed in her hand. This retort to his last appeal might have been interpreted as a classic move in a familiar game; but the young man chose to give it a different meaning. She was still fighting against her fate; but she was going to Europe, and she was not returning to her husband. Nothing, therefore, was to prevent his following her; and once he had taken the irrevocable step, and had proved to her that it was irrevocable, he believed she would not send him away. This confidence in the future had steadied him to play his part in the present. It had kept him from writing to her, or betraying, by any sign or act, his misery and mortification. It seemed to him that in the deadly silent game between them the trumps were still in his hands; and he waited. There had been, nevertheless, moments sufficiently difficult to pass; as when Mr. Letterblair, the day after Madame Olenska's departure, had sent for him to go over the details of the trust which Mrs. Manson Mingott wished to create for her granddaughter. For a couple of hours Archer had examined the terms of the deed with his senior, all the while obscurely feeling that if he had been consulted it was for some reason other than the obvious one of his cousinship; and that the close of the conference would reveal it. ""Well, the lady can't deny that it's a handsome arrangement,"" Mr. Letterblair had summed up, after mumbling over a summary of the settlement. ""In fact I'm bound to say she's been treated pretty handsomely all round."" ""All round?"" Archer echoed with a touch of derision. ""Do you refer to her husband's proposal to give her back her own money?"" Mr. Letterblair's bushy eyebrows went up a fraction of an inch. ""My dear sir, the law's the law; and your wife's cousin was married under the French law. It's to be presumed she knew what that meant."" ""Even if she did, what happened subsequently--."" But Archer paused. Mr. Letterblair had laid his pen- handle against his big corrugated nose, and was looking down it with the expression assumed by virtuous elderly gentlemen when they wish their youngers to understand that virtue is not synonymous with ignorance. ""My dear sir, I've no wish to extenuate the Count's transgressions; but--but on the other side . . . I wouldn't put my hand in the fire . . . well, that there hadn't been tit for tat . . . with the young champion. . . ."" Mr. Letterblair unlocked a drawer and pushed a folded paper toward Archer. ""This report, the result of discreet enquiries . . ."" And then, as Archer made no effort to glance at the paper or to repudiate the suggestion, the lawyer somewhat flatly continued: ""I don't say it's conclusive, you observe; far from it. But straws show . . . and on the whole it's eminently satisfactory for all parties that this dignified solution has been reached."" ""Oh, eminently,"" Archer assented, pushing back the paper. A day or two later, on responding to a summons from Mrs. Manson Mingott, his soul had been more deeply tried. He had found the old lady depressed and querulous. ""You know she's deserted me?"" she began at once; and without waiting for his reply: ""Oh, don't ask me why! She gave so many reasons that I've forgotten them all. My private belief is that she couldn't face the boredom. At any rate that's what Augusta and my daughters-in-law think. And I don't know that I altogether blame her. Olenski's a finished scoundrel; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer than it is in Fifth Avenue. Not that the family would admit that: they think Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in. And poor Ellen, of course, has no idea of going back to her husband. She held out as firmly as ever against that. So she's to settle down in Paris with that fool Medora. . . . Well, Paris is Paris; and you can keep a carriage there on next to nothing. But she was as gay as a bird, and I shall miss her."" Two tears, the parched tears of the old, rolled down her puffy cheeks and vanished in the abysses of her bosom. ""All I ask is,"" she concluded, ""that they shouldn't bother me any more. I must really be allowed to digest my gruel. . . ."" And she twinkled a little wistfully at Archer. It was that evening, on his return home, that May announced her intention of giving a farewell dinner to her cousin. Madame Olenska's name had not been pronounced between them since the night of her flight to Washington; and Archer looked at his wife with surprise. ""A dinner--why?"" he interrogated. Her colour rose. ""But you like Ellen--I thought you'd be pleased."" ""It's awfully nice--your putting it in that way. But I really don't see--"" ""I mean to do it, Newland,"" she said, quietly rising and going to her desk. ""Here are the invitations all written. Mother helped me--she agrees that we ought to."" She paused, embarrassed and yet smiling, and Archer suddenly saw before him the embodied image of the Family. ""Oh, all right,"" he said, staring with unseeing eyes at the list of guests that she had put in his hand. When he entered the drawing-room before dinner May was stooping over the fire and trying to coax the logs to burn in their unaccustomed setting of immaculate tiles. The tall lamps were all lit, and Mr. van der Luyden's orchids had been conspicuously disposed in various receptacles of modern porcelain and knobby silver. Mrs. Newland Archer's drawing-room was generally thought a great success. A gilt bamboo jardiniere, in which the primulas and cinerarias were punctually renewed, blocked the access to the bay window (where the old- fashioned would have preferred a bronze reduction of the Venus of Milo); the sofas and arm-chairs of pale brocade were cleverly grouped about little plush tables densely covered with silver toys, porcelain animals and efflorescent photograph frames; and tall rosy-shaded lamps shot up like tropical flowers among the palms. ""I don't think Ellen has ever seen this room lighted up,"" said May, rising flushed from her struggle, and sending about her a glance of pardonable pride. The brass tongs which she had propped against the side of the chimney fell with a crash that drowned her husband's answer; and before he could restore them Mr. and Mrs. van der Luyden were announced. The other guests quickly followed, for it was known that the van der Luydens liked to dine punctually. The room was nearly full, and Archer was engaged in showing to Mrs. Selfridge Merry a small highly-varnished Verbeckhoven ""Study of Sheep,"" which Mr. Welland had given May for Christmas, when he found Madame Olenska at his side. She was excessively pale, and her pallor made her dark hair seem denser and heavier than ever. Perhaps that, or the fact that she had wound several rows of amber beads about her neck, reminded him suddenly of the little Ellen Mingott he had danced with at children's parties, when Medora Manson had first brought her to New York. The amber beads were trying to her complexion, or her dress was perhaps unbecoming: her face looked lustreless and almost ugly, and he had never loved it as he did at that minute. Their hands met, and he thought he heard her say: ""Yes, we're sailing tomorrow in the Russia--""; then there was an unmeaning noise of opening doors, and after an interval May's voice: ""Newland! Dinner's been announced. Won't you please take Ellen in?"" Madame Olenska put her hand on his arm, and he noticed that the hand was ungloved, and remembered how he had kept his eyes fixed on it the evening that he had sat with her in the little Twenty-third Street drawing- room. All the beauty that had forsaken her face seemed to have taken refuge in the long pale fingers and faintly dimpled knuckles on his sleeve, and he said to himself: ""If it were only to see her hand again I should have to follow her--."" It was only at an entertainment ostensibly offered to a ""foreign visitor"" that Mrs. van der Luyden could suffer the diminution of being placed on her host's left. The fact of Madame Olenska's ""foreignness"" could hardly have been more adroitly emphasised than by this farewell tribute; and Mrs. van der Luyden accepted her displacement with an affability which left no doubt as to her approval. There were certain things that had to be done, and if done at all, done handsomely and thoroughly; and one of these, in the old New York code, was the tribal rally around a kinswoman about to be eliminated from the tribe. There was nothing on earth that the Wellands and Mingotts would not have done to proclaim their unalterable affection for the Countess Olenska now that her passage for Europe was engaged; and Archer, at the head of his table, sat marvelling at the silent untiring activity with which her popularity had been retrieved, grievances against her silenced, her past countenanced, and her present irradiated by the family approval. Mrs. van der Luyden shone on her with the dim benevolence which was her nearest approach to cordiality, and Mr. van der Luyden, from his seat at May's right, cast down the table glances plainly intended to justify all the carnations he had sent from Skuytercliff. Archer, who seemed to be assisting at the scene in a state of odd imponderability, as if he floated somewhere between chandelier and ceiling, wondered at nothing so much as his own share in the proceedings. As his glance travelled from one placid well-fed face to another he saw all the harmless-looking people engaged upon May's canvas-backs as a band of dumb conspirators, and himself and the pale woman on his right as the centre of their conspiracy. And then it came over him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers, lovers in the extreme sense peculiar to ""foreign"" vocabularies. He guessed himself to have been, for months, the centre of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears, he understood that, by means as yet unknown to him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined anything, and that the occasion of the entertainment was simply May Archer's natural desire to take an affectionate leave of her friend and cousin. It was the old New York way of taking life ""without effusion of blood"": the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than ""scenes,"" except the behaviour of those who gave rise to them. As these thoughts succeeded each other in his mind Archer felt like a prisoner in the centre of an armed camp. He looked about the table, and guessed at the inexorableness of his captors from the tone in which, over the asparagus from Florida, they were dealing with Beaufort and his wife. ""It's to show me,"" he thought, ""what would happen to ME--"" and a deathly sense of the superiority of implication and analogy over direct action, and of silence over rash words, closed in on him like the doors of the family vault. He laughed, and met Mrs. van der Luyden's startled eyes. ""You think it laughable?"" she said with a pinched smile. ""Of course poor Regina's idea of remaining in New York has its ridiculous side, I suppose;"" and Archer muttered: ""Of course."" At this point, he became conscious that Madame Olenska's other neighbour had been engaged for some time with the lady on his right. At the same moment he saw that May, serenely enthroned between Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, had cast a quick glance down the table. It was evident that the host and the lady on his right could not sit through the whole meal in silence. He turned to Madame Olenska, and her pale smile met him. ""Oh, do let's see it through,"" it seemed to say. ""Did you find the journey tiring?"" he asked in a voice that surprised him by its naturalness; and she answered that, on the contrary, she had seldom travelled with fewer discomforts. ""Except, you know, the dreadful heat in the train,"" she added; and he remarked that she would not suffer from that particular hardship in the country she was going to. ""I never,"" he declared with intensity, ""was more nearly frozen than once, in April, in the train between Calais and Paris."" She said she did not wonder, but remarked that, after all, one could always carry an extra rug, and that every form of travel had its hardships; to which he abruptly returned that he thought them all of no account compared with the blessedness of getting away. She changed colour, and he added, his voice suddenly rising in pitch: ""I mean to do a lot of travelling myself before long."" A tremor crossed her face, and leaning over to Reggie Chivers, he cried out: ""I say, Reggie, what do you say to a trip round the world: now, next month, I mean? I'm game if you are--"" at which Mrs. Reggie piped up that she could not think of letting Reggie go till after the Martha Washington Ball she was getting up for the Blind Asylum in Easter week; and her husband placidly observed that by that time he would have to be practising for the International Polo match. But Mr. Selfridge Merry had caught the phrase ""round the world,"" and having once circled the globe in his steam-yacht, he seized the opportunity to send down the table several striking items concerning the shallowness of the Mediterranean ports. Though, after all, he added, it didn't matter; for when you'd seen Athens and Smyrna and Constantinople, what else was there? And Mrs. Merry said she could never be too grateful to Dr. Bencomb for having made them promise not to go to Naples on account of the fever. ""But you must have three weeks to do India properly,"" her husband conceded, anxious to have it understood that he was no frivolous globe-trotter. And at this point the ladies went up to the drawing- room. In the library, in spite of weightier presences, Lawrence Lefferts predominated. The talk, as usual, had veered around to the Beauforts, and even Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Selfridge Merry, installed in the honorary arm-chairs tacitly reserved for them, paused to listen to the younger man's philippic. Never had Lefferts so abounded in the sentiments that adorn Christian manhood and exalt the sanctity of the home. Indignation lent him a scathing eloquence, and it was clear that if others had followed his example, and acted as he talked, society would never have been weak enough to receive a foreign upstart like Beaufort--no, sir, not even if he'd married a van der Luyden or a Lanning instead of a Dallas. And what chance would there have been, Lefferts wrathfully questioned, of his marrying into such a family as the Dallases, if he had not already wormed his way into certain houses, as people like Mrs. Lemuel Struthers had managed to worm theirs in his wake? If society chose to open its doors to vulgar women the harm was not great, though the gain was doubtful; but once it got in the way of tolerating men of obscure origin and tainted wealth the end was total disintegration--and at no distant date. ""If things go on at this pace,"" Lefferts thundered, looking like a young prophet dressed by Poole, and who had not yet been stoned, ""we shall see our children fighting for invitations to swindlers' houses, and marrying Beaufort's bastards."" ""Oh, I say--draw it mild!"" Reggie Chivers and young Newland protested, while Mr. Selfridge Merry looked genuinely alarmed, and an expression of pain and disgust settled on Mr. van der Luyden's sensitive face. ""Has he got any?"" cried Mr. Sillerton Jackson, pricking up his ears; and while Lefferts tried to turn the question with a laugh, the old gentleman twittered into Archer's ear: ""Queer, those fellows who are always wanting to set things right. The people who have the worst cooks are always telling you they're poisoned when they dine out. But I hear there are pressing reasons for our friend Lawrence's diatribe:--typewriter this time, I understand. . . ."" The talk swept past Archer like some senseless river running and running because it did not know enough to stop. He saw, on the faces about him, expressions of interest, amusement and even mirth. He listened to the younger men's laughter, and to the praise of the Archer Madeira, which Mr. van der Luyden and Mr. Merry were thoughtfully celebrating. Through it all he was dimly aware of a general attitude of friendliness toward himself, as if the guard of the prisoner he felt himself to be were trying to soften his captivity; and the perception increased his passionate determination to be free. In the drawing-room, where they presently joined the ladies, he met May's triumphant eyes, and read in them the conviction that everything had ""gone off"" beautifully. She rose from Madame Olenska's side, and immediately Mrs. van der Luyden beckoned the latter to a seat on the gilt sofa where she throned. Mrs. Selfridge Merry bore across the room to join them, and it became clear to Archer that here also a conspiracy of rehabilitation and obliteration was going on. The silent organisation which held his little world together was determined to put itself on record as never for a moment having questioned the propriety of Madame Olenska's conduct, or the completeness of Archer's domestic felicity. All these amiable and inexorable persons were resolutely engaged in pretending to each other that they had never heard of, suspected, or even conceived possible, the least hint to the contrary; and from this tissue of elaborate mutual dissimulation Archer once more disengaged the fact that New York believed him to be Madame Olenska's lover. He caught the glitter of victory in his wife's eyes, and for the first time understood that she shared the belief. The discovery roused a laughter of inner devils that reverberated through all his efforts to discuss the Martha Washington ball with Mrs. Reggie Chivers and little Mrs. Newland; and so the evening swept on, running and running like a senseless river that did not know how to stop. At length he saw that Madame Olenska had risen and was saying good-bye. He understood that in a moment she would be gone, and tried to remember what he had said to her at dinner; but he could not recall a single word they had exchanged. She went up to May, the rest of the company making a circle about her as she advanced. The two young women clasped hands; then May bent forward and kissed her cousin. ""Certainly our hostess is much the handsomer of the two,"" Archer heard Reggie Chivers say in an undertone to young Mrs. Newland; and he remembered Beaufort's coarse sneer at May's ineffectual beauty. A moment later he was in the hall, putting Madame Olenska's cloak about her shoulders. Through all his confusion of mind he had held fast to the resolve to say nothing that might startle or disturb her. Convinced that no power could now turn him from his purpose he had found strength to let events shape themselves as they would. But as he followed Madame Olenska into the hall he thought with a sudden hunger of being for a moment alone with her at the door of her carriage. ""Is your carriage here?"" he asked; and at that moment Mrs. van der Luyden, who was being majestically inserted into her sables, said gently: ""We are driving dear Ellen home."" Archer's heart gave a jerk, and Madame Olenska, clasping her cloak and fan with one hand, held out the other to him. ""Good-bye,"" she said. ""Good-bye--but I shall see you soon in Paris,"" he answered aloud--it seemed to him that he had shouted it. ""Oh,"" she murmured, ""if you and May could come--!"" Mr. van der Luyden advanced to give her his arm, and Archer turned to Mrs. van der Luyden. For a moment, in the billowy darkness inside the big landau, he caught the dim oval of a face, eyes shining steadily-- and she was gone. As he went up the steps he crossed Lawrence Lefferts coming down with his wife. Lefferts caught his host by the sleeve, drawing back to let Gertrude pass. ""I say, old chap: do you mind just letting it be understood that I'm dining with you at the club tomorrow night? Thanks so much, you old brick! Good-night."" ""It DID go off beautifully, didn't it?"" May questioned from the threshold of the library. Archer roused himself with a start. As soon as the last carriage had driven away, he had come up to the library and shut himself in, with the hope that his wife, who still lingered below, would go straight to her room. But there she stood, pale and drawn, yet radiating the factitious energy of one who has passed beyond fatigue. ""May I come and talk it over?"" she asked. ""Of course, if you like. But you must be awfully sleepy--"" ""No, I'm not sleepy. I should like to sit with you a little."" ""Very well,"" he said, pushing her chair near the fire. She sat down and he resumed his seat; but neither spoke for a long time. At length Archer began abruptly: ""Since you're not tired, and want to talk, there's something I must tell you. I tried to the other night--."" She looked at him quickly. ""Yes, dear. Something about yourself?"" ""About myself. You say you're not tired: well, I am. Horribly tired . . ."" In an instant she was all tender anxiety. ""Oh, I've seen it coming on, Newland! You've been so wickedly overworked--"" ""Perhaps it's that. Anyhow, I want to make a break--"" ""A break? To give up the law?"" ""To go away, at any rate--at once. On a long trip, ever so far off--away from everything--"" He paused, conscious that he had failed in his attempt to speak with the indifference of a man who longs for a change, and is yet too weary to welcome it. Do what he would, the chord of eagerness vibrated. ""Away from everything--"" he repeated. ""Ever so far? Where, for instance?"" she asked. ""Oh, I don't know. India--or Japan."" She stood up, and as he sat with bent head, his chin propped on his hands, he felt her warmly and fragrantly hovering over him. ""As far as that? But I'm afraid you can't, dear . . ."" she said in an unsteady voice. ""Not unless you'll take me with you."" And then, as he was silent, she went on, in tones so clear and evenly-pitched that each separate syllable tapped like a little hammer on his brain: ""That is, if the doctors will let me go . . . but I'm afraid they won't. For you see, Newland, I've been sure since this morning of something I've been so longing and hoping for--"" He looked up at her with a sick stare, and she sank down, all dew and roses, and hid her face against his knee. ""Oh, my dear,"" he said, holding her to him while his cold hand stroked her hair. There was a long pause, which the inner devils filled with strident laughter; then May freed herself from his arms and stood up. ""You didn't guess--?"" ""Yes--I; no. That is, of course I hoped--"" They looked at each other for an instant and again fell silent; then, turning his eyes from hers, he asked abruptly: ""Have you told any one else?"" ""Only Mamma and your mother."" She paused, and then added hurriedly, the blood flushing up to her forehead: ""That is--and Ellen. You know I told you we'd had a long talk one afternoon--and how dear she was to me."" ""Ah--"" said Archer, his heart stopping. He felt that his wife was watching him intently. ""Did you MIND my telling her first, Newland?"" ""Mind? Why should I?"" He made a last effort to collect himself. ""But that was a fortnight ago, wasn't it? I thought you said you weren't sure till today."" Her colour burned deeper, but she held his gaze. ""No; I wasn't sure then--but I told her I was. And you see I was right!"" she exclaimed, her blue eyes wet with victory.  XXXIV. Newland Archer sat at the writing-table in his library in East Thirty-ninth Street. He had just got back from a big official reception for the inauguration of the new galleries at the Metropolitan Museum, and the spectacle of those great spaces crowded with the spoils of the ages, where the throng of fashion circulated through a series of scientifically catalogued treasures, had suddenly pressed on a rusted spring of memory. ""Why, this used to be one of the old Cesnola rooms,"" he heard some one say; and instantly everything about him vanished, and he was sitting alone on a hard leather divan against a radiator, while a slight figure in a long sealskin cloak moved away down the meagrely- fitted vista of the old Museum. The vision had roused a host of other associations, and he sat looking with new eyes at the library which, for over thirty years, had been the scene of his solitary musings and of all the family confabulations. It was the room in which most of the real things of his life had happened. There his wife, nearly twenty-six years ago, had broken to him, with a blushing circumlocution that would have caused the young women of the new generation to smile, the news that she was to have a child; and there their eldest boy, Dallas, too delicate to be taken to church in midwinter, had been christened by their old friend the Bishop of New York, the ample magnificent irreplaceable Bishop, so long the pride and ornament of his diocese. There Dallas had first staggered across the floor shouting ""Dad,"" while May and the nurse laughed behind the door; there their second child, Mary (who was so like her mother), had announced her engagement to the dullest and most reliable of Reggie Chivers's many sons; and there Archer had kissed her through her wedding veil before they went down to the motor which was to carry them to Grace Church--for in a world where all else had reeled on its foundations the ""Grace Church wedding"" remained an unchanged institution. It was in the library that he and May had always discussed the future of the children: the studies of Dallas and his young brother Bill, Mary's incurable indifference to ""accomplishments,"" and passion for sport and philanthropy, and the vague leanings toward ""art"" which had finally landed the restless and curious Dallas in the office of a rising New York architect. The young men nowadays were emancipating themselves from the law and business and taking up all sorts of new things. If they were not absorbed in state politics or municipal reform, the chances were that they were going in for Central American archaeology, for architecture or landscape-engineering; taking a keen and learned interest in the prerevolutionary buildings of their own country, studying and adapting Georgian types, and protesting at the meaningless use of the word ""Colonial."" Nobody nowadays had ""Colonial"" houses except the millionaire grocers of the suburbs. But above all--sometimes Archer put it above all--it was in that library that the Governor of New York, coming down from Albany one evening to dine and spend the night, had turned to his host, and said, banging his clenched fist on the table and gnashing his eye-glasses: ""Hang the professional politician! You're the kind of man the country wants, Archer. If the stable's ever to be cleaned out, men like you have got to lend a hand in the cleaning."" ""Men like you--"" how Archer had glowed at the phrase! How eagerly he had risen up at the call! It was an echo of Ned Winsett's old appeal to roll his sleeves up and get down into the muck; but spoken by a man who set the example of the gesture, and whose summons to follow him was irresistible. Archer, as he looked back, was not sure that men like himself WERE what his country needed, at least in the active service to which Theodore Roosevelt had pointed; in fact, there was reason to think it did not, for after a year in the State Assembly he had not been re-elected, and had dropped back thankfully into obscure if useful municipal work, and from that again to the writing of occasional articles in one of the reforming weeklies that were trying to shake the country out of its apathy. It was little enough to look back on; but when he remembered to what the young men of his generation and his set had looked forward--the narrow groove of money-making, sport and society to which their vision had been limited--even his small contribution to the new state of things seemed to count, as each brick counts in a well-built wall. He had done little in public life; he would always be by nature a contemplative and a dilettante; but he had had high things to contemplate, great things to delight in; and one great man's friendship to be his strength and pride. He had been, in short, what people were beginning to call ""a good citizen."" In New York, for many years past, every new movement, philanthropic, municipal or artistic, had taken account of his opinion and wanted his name. People said: ""Ask Archer"" when there was a question of starting the first school for crippled children, reorganising the Museum of Art, founding the Grolier Club, inaugurating the new Library, or getting up a new society of chamber music. His days were full, and they were filled decently. He supposed it was all a man ought to ask. Something he knew he had missed: the flower of life. But he thought of it now as a thing so unattainable and improbable that to have repined would have been like despairing because one had not drawn the first prize in a lottery. There were a hundred million tickets in HIS lottery, and there was only one prize; the chances had been too decidedly against him. When he thought of Ellen Olenska it was abstractly, serenely, as one might think of some imaginary beloved in a book or a picture: she had become the composite vision of all that he had missed. That vision, faint and tenuous as it was, had kept him from thinking of other women. He had been what was called a faithful husband; and when May had suddenly died--carried off by the infectious pneumonia through which she had nursed their youngest child--he had honestly mourned her. Their long years together had shown him that it did not so much matter if marriage was a dull duty, as long as it kept the dignity of a duty: lapsing from that, it became a mere battle of ugly appetites. Looking about him, he honoured his own past, and mourned for it. After all, there was good in the old ways. His eyes, making the round of the room--done over by Dallas with English mezzotints, Chippendale cabinets, bits of chosen blue-and-white and pleasantly shaded electric lamps--came back to the old Eastlake writing- table that he had never been willing to banish, and to his first photograph of May, which still kept its place beside his inkstand. There she was, tall, round-bosomed and willowy, in her starched muslin and flapping Leghorn, as he had seen her under the orange-trees in the Mission garden. And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained; never quite at the same height, yet never far below it: generous, faithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of growth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change. This hard bright blindness had kept her immediate horizon apparently unaltered. Her incapacity to recognise change made her children conceal their views from her as Archer concealed his; there had been, from the first, a joint pretence of sameness, a kind of innocent family hypocrisy, in which father and children had unconsciously collaborated. And she had died thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious households like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate in Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents' lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her) would transmit the sacred trust to little Bill. And of Mary she was sure as of her own self. So, having snatched little Bill from the grave, and given her life in the effort, she went contentedly to her place in the Archer vault in St. Mark's, where Mrs. Archer already lay safe from the terrifying ""trend"" which her daughter-in-law had never even become aware of. Opposite May's portrait stood one of her daughter. Mary Chivers was as tall and fair as her mother, but large-waisted, flat-chested and slightly slouching, as the altered fashion required. Mary Chivers's mighty feats of athleticism could not have been performed with the twenty-inch waist that May Archer's azure sash so easily spanned. And the difference seemed symbolic; the mother's life had been as closely girt as her figure. Mary, who was no less conventional, and no more intelligent, yet led a larger life and held more tolerant views. There was good in the new order too. The telephone clicked, and Archer, turning from the photographs, unhooked the transmitter at his elbow. How far they were from the days when the legs of the brass-buttoned messenger boy had been New York's only means of quick communication! ""Chicago wants you."" Ah--it must be a long-distance from Dallas, who had been sent to Chicago by his firm to talk over the plan of the Lakeside palace they were to build for a young millionaire with ideas. The firm always sent Dallas on such errands. ""Hallo, Dad--Yes: Dallas. I say--how do you feel about sailing on Wednesday? Mauretania: Yes, next Wednesday as ever is. Our client wants me to look at some Italian gardens before we settle anything, and has asked me to nip over on the next boat. I've got to be back on the first of June--"" the voice broke into a joyful conscious laugh--""so we must look alive. I say, Dad, I want your help: do come."" Dallas seemed to be speaking in the room: the voice was as near by and natural as if he had been lounging in his favourite arm-chair by the fire. The fact would not ordinarily have surprised Archer, for long-distance telephoning had become as much a matter of course as electric lighting and five-day Atlantic voyages. But the laugh did startle him; it still seemed wonderful that across all those miles and miles of country--forest, river, mountain, prairie, roaring cities and busy indifferent millions--Dallas's laugh should be able to say: ""Of course, whatever happens, I must get back on the first, because Fanny Beaufort and I are to be married on the fifth."" The voice began again: ""Think it over? No, sir: not a minute. You've got to say yes now. Why not, I'd like to know? If you can allege a single reason--No; I knew it. Then it's a go, eh? Because I count on you to ring up the Cunard office first thing tomorrow; and you'd better book a return on a boat from Marseilles. I say, Dad; it'll be our last time together, in this kind of way--. Oh, good! I knew you would."" Chicago rang off, and Archer rose and began to pace up and down the room. It would be their last time together in this kind of way: the boy was right. They would have lots of other ""times"" after Dallas's marriage, his father was sure; for the two were born comrades, and Fanny Beaufort, whatever one might think of her, did not seem likely to interfere with their intimacy. On the contrary, from what he had seen of her, he thought she would be naturally included in it. Still, change was change, and differences were differences, and much as he felt himself drawn toward his future daughter-in-law, it was tempting to seize this last chance of being alone with his boy. There was no reason why he should not seize it, except the profound one that he had lost the habit of travel. May had disliked to move except for valid reasons, such as taking the children to the sea or in the mountains: she could imagine no other motive for leaving the house in Thirty-ninth Street or their comfortable quarters at the Wellands' in Newport. After Dallas had taken his degree she had thought it her duty to travel for six months; and the whole family had made the old-fashioned tour through England, Switzerland and Italy. Their time being limited (no one knew why) they had omitted France. Archer remembered Dallas's wrath at being asked to contemplate Mont Blanc instead of Rheims and Chartres. But Mary and Bill wanted mountain-climbing, and had already yawned their way in Dallas's wake through the English cathedrals; and May, always fair to her children, had insisted on holding the balance evenly between their athletic and artistic proclivities. She had indeed proposed that her husband should go to Paris for a fortnight, and join them on the Italian lakes after they had ""done"" Switzerland; but Archer had declined. ""We'll stick together,"" he said; and May's face had brightened at his setting such a good example to Dallas. Since her death, nearly two years before, there had been no reason for his continuing in the same routine. His children had urged him to travel: Mary Chivers had felt sure it would do him good to go abroad and ""see the galleries."" The very mysteriousness of such a cure made her the more confident of its efficacy. But Archer had found himself held fast by habit, by memories, by a sudden startled shrinking from new things. Now, as he reviewed his past, he saw into what a deep rut he had sunk. The worst of doing one's duty was that it apparently unfitted one for doing anything else. At least that was the view that the men of his generation had taken. The trenchant divisions between right and wrong, honest and dishonest, respectable and the reverse, had left so little scope for the unforeseen. There are moments when a man's imagination, so easily subdued to what it lives in, suddenly rises above its daily level, and surveys the long windings of destiny. Archer hung there and wondered. . . . What was left of the little world he had grown up in, and whose standards had bent and bound him? He remembered a sneering prophecy of poor Lawrence Lefferts's, uttered years ago in that very room: ""If things go on at this rate, our children will be marrying Beaufort's bastards."" It was just what Archer's eldest son, the pride of his life, was doing; and nobody wondered or reproved. Even the boy's Aunt Janey, who still looked so exactly as she used to in her elderly youth, had taken her mother's emeralds and seed-pearls out of their pink cotton-wool, and carried them with her own twitching hands to the future bride; and Fanny Beaufort, instead of looking disappointed at not receiving a ""set"" from a Paris jeweller, had exclaimed at their old-fashioned beauty, and declared that when she wore them she should feel like an Isabey miniature. Fanny Beaufort, who had appeared in New York at eighteen, after the death of her parents, had won its heart much as Madame Olenska had won it thirty years earlier; only instead of being distrustful and afraid of her, society took her joyfully for granted. She was pretty, amusing and accomplished: what more did any one want? Nobody was narrow-minded enough to rake up against her the half-forgotten facts of her father's past and her own origin. Only the older people remembered so obscure an incident in the business life of New York as Beaufort's failure, or the fact that after his wife's death he had been quietly married to the notorious Fanny Ring, and had left the country with his new wife, and a little girl who inherited her beauty. He was subsequently heard of in Constantinople, then in Russia; and a dozen years later American travellers were handsomely entertained by him in Buenos Ayres, where he represented a large insurance agency. He and his wife died there in the odour of prosperity; and one day their orphaned daughter had appeared in New York in charge of May Archer's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jack Welland, whose husband had been appointed the girl's guardian. The fact threw her into almost cousinly relationship with Newland Archer's children, and nobody was surprised when Dallas's engagement was announced. Nothing could more dearly give the measure of the distance that the world had travelled. People nowadays were too busy--busy with reforms and ""movements,"" with fads and fetishes and frivolities--to bother much about their neighbours. And of what account was anybody's past, in the huge kaleidoscope where all the social atoms spun around on the same plane? Newland Archer, looking out of his hotel window at the stately gaiety of the Paris streets, felt his heart beating with the confusion and eagerness of youth. It was long since it had thus plunged and reared under his widening waistcoat, leaving him, the next minute, with an empty breast and hot temples. He wondered if it was thus that his son's conducted itself in the presence of Miss Fanny Beaufort--and decided that it was not. ""It functions as actively, no doubt, but the rhythm is different,"" he reflected, recalling the cool composure with which the young man had announced his engagement, and taken for granted that his family would approve. ""The difference is that these young people take it for granted that they're going to get whatever they want, and that we almost always took it for granted that we shouldn't. Only, I wonder--the thing one's so certain of in advance: can it ever make one's heart beat as wildly?"" It was the day after their arrival in Paris, and the spring sunshine held Archer in his open window, above the wide silvery prospect of the Place Vendome. One of the things he had stipulated--almost the only one-- when he had agreed to come abroad with Dallas, was that, in Paris, he shouldn't be made to go to one of the newfangled ""palaces."" ""Oh, all right--of course,"" Dallas good-naturedly agreed. ""I'll take you to some jolly old-fashioned place-- the Bristol say--"" leaving his father speechless at hearing that the century-long home of kings and emperors was now spoken of as an old-fashioned inn, where one went for its quaint inconveniences and lingering local colour. Archer had pictured often enough, in the first impatient years, the scene of his return to Paris; then the personal vision had faded, and he had simply tried to see the city as the setting of Madame Olenska's life. Sitting alone at night in his library, after the household had gone to bed, he had evoked the radiant outbreak of spring down the avenues of horse-chestnuts, the flowers and statues in the public gardens, the whiff of lilacs from the flower-carts, the majestic roll of the river under the great bridges, and the life of art and study and pleasure that filled each mighty artery to bursting. Now the spectacle was before him in its glory, and as he looked out on it he felt shy, old-fashioned, inadequate: a mere grey speck of a man compared with the ruthless magnificent fellow he had dreamed of being. . . . Dallas's hand came down cheerily on his shoulder. ""Hullo, father: this is something like, isn't it?"" They stood for a while looking out in silence, and then the young man continued: ""By the way, I've got a message for you: the Countess Olenska expects us both at half- past five."" He said it lightly, carelessly, as he might have imparted any casual item of information, such as the hour at which their train was to leave for Florence the next evening. Archer looked at him, and thought he saw in his gay young eyes a gleam of his great-grandmother Mingott's malice. ""Oh, didn't I tell you?"" Dallas pursued. ""Fanny made me swear to do three things while I was in Paris: get her the score of the last Debussy songs, go to the Grand-Guignol and see Madame Olenska. You know she was awfully good to Fanny when Mr. Beaufort sent her over from Buenos Ayres to the Assomption. Fanny hadn't any friends in Paris, and Madame Olenska used to be kind to her and trot her about on holidays. I believe she was a great friend of the first Mrs. Beaufort's. And she's our cousin, of course. So I rang her up this morning, before I went out, and told her you and I were here for two days and wanted to see her."" Archer continued to stare at him. ""You told her I was here?"" ""Of course--why not?"" Dallas's eye brows went up whimsically. Then, getting no answer, he slipped his arm through his father's with a confidential pressure. ""I say, father: what was she like?"" Archer felt his colour rise under his son's unabashed gaze. ""Come, own up: you and she were great pals, weren't you? Wasn't she most awfully lovely?"" ""Lovely? I don't know. She was different."" ""Ah--there you have it! That's what it always comes to, doesn't it? When she comes, SHE'S DIFFERENT--and one doesn't know why. It's exactly what I feel about Fanny."" His father drew back a step, releasing his arm. ""About Fanny? But, my dear fellow--I should hope so! Only I don't see--"" ""Dash it, Dad, don't be prehistoric! Wasn't she-- once--your Fanny?"" Dallas belonged body and soul to the new generation. He was the first-born of Newland and May Archer, yet it had never been possible to inculcate in him even the rudiments of reserve. ""What's the use of making mysteries? It only makes people want to nose 'em out,"" he always objected when enjoined to discretion. But Archer, meeting his eyes, saw the filial light under their banter. ""My Fanny?"" ""Well, the woman you'd have chucked everything for: only you didn't,"" continued his surprising son. ""I didn't,"" echoed Archer with a kind of solemnity. ""No: you date, you see, dear old boy. But mother said--"" ""Your mother?"" ""Yes: the day before she died. It was when she sent for me alone--you remember? She said she knew we were safe with you, and always would be, because once, when she asked you to, you'd given up the thing you most wanted."" Archer received this strange communication in silence. His eyes remained unseeingly fixed on the thronged sunlit square below the window. At length he said in a low voice: ""She never asked me."" ""No. I forgot. You never did ask each other anything, did you? And you never told each other anything. You just sat and watched each other, and guessed at what was going on underneath. A deaf-and-dumb asylum, in fact! Well, I back your generation for knowing more about each other's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about our own.--I say, Dad,"" Dallas broke off, ""you're not angry with me? If you are, let's make it up and go and lunch at Henri's. I've got to rush out to Versailles afterward."" Archer did not accompany his son to Versailles. He preferred to spend the afternoon in solitary roamings through Paris. He had to deal all at once with the packed regrets and stifled memories of an inarticulate lifetime. After a little while he did not regret Dallas's indiscretion. It seemed to take an iron band from his heart to know that, after all, some one had guessed and pitied. . . . And that it should have been his wife moved him indescribably. Dallas, for all his affectionate insight, would not have understood that. To the boy, no doubt, the episode was only a pathetic instance of vain frustration, of wasted forces. But was it really no more? For a long time Archer sat on a bench in the Champs Elysees and wondered, while the stream of life rolled by. . . . A few streets away, a few hours away, Ellen Olenska waited. She had never gone back to her husband, and when he had died, some years before, she had made no change in her way of living. There was nothing now to keep her and Archer apart--and that afternoon he was to see her. He got up and walked across the Place de la Concorde and the Tuileries gardens to the Louvre. She had once told him that she often went there, and he had a fancy to spend the intervening time in a place where he could think of her as perhaps having lately been. For an hour or more he wandered from gallery to gallery through the dazzle of afternoon light, and one by one the pictures burst on him in their half-forgotten splendour, filling his soul with the long echoes of beauty. After all, his life had been too starved. . . . Suddenly, before an effulgent Titian, he found himself saying: ""But I'm only fifty-seven--"" and then he turned away. For such summer dreams it was too late; but surely not for a quiet harvest of friendship, of comradeship, in the blessed hush of her nearness. He went back to the hotel, where he and Dallas were to meet; and together they walked again across the Place de la Concorde and over the bridge that leads to the Chamber of Deputies. Dallas, unconscious of what was going on in his father's mind, was talking excitedly and abundantly of Versailles. He had had but one previous glimpse of it, during a holiday trip in which he had tried to pack all the sights he had been deprived of when he had had to go with the family to Switzerland; and tumultuous enthusiasm and cock-sure criticism tripped each other up on his lips. As Archer listened, his sense of inadequacy and inexpressiveness increased. The boy was not insensitive, he knew; but he had the facility and self-confidence that came of looking at fate not as a master but as an equal. ""That's it: they feel equal to things--they know their way about,"" he mused, thinking of his son as the spokesman of the new generation which had swept away all the old landmarks, and with them the sign- posts and the danger-signal. Suddenly Dallas stopped short, grasping his father's arm. ""Oh, by Jove,"" he exclaimed. They had come out into the great tree-planted space before the Invalides. The dome of Mansart floated ethereally above the budding trees and the long grey front of the building: drawing up into itself all the rays of afternoon light, it hung there like the visible symbol of the race's glory. Archer knew that Madame Olenska lived in a square near one of the avenues radiating from the Invalides; and he had pictured the quarter as quiet and almost obscure, forgetting the central splendour that lit it up. Now, by some queer process of association, that golden light became for him the pervading illumination in which she lived. For nearly thirty years, her life--of which he knew so strangely little--had been spent in this rich atmosphere that he already felt to be too dense and yet too stimulating for his lungs. He thought of the theatres she must have been to, the pictures she must have looked at, the sober and splendid old houses she must have frequented, the people she must have talked with, the incessant stir of ideas, curiosities, images and associations thrown out by an intensely social race in a setting of immemorial manners; and suddenly he remembered the young Frenchman who had once said to him: ""Ah, good conversation--there is nothing like it, is there?"" Archer had not seen M. Riviere, or heard of him, for nearly thirty years; and that fact gave the measure of his ignorance of Madame Olenska's existence. More than half a lifetime divided them, and she had spent the long interval among people he did not know, in a society he but faintly guessed at, in conditions he would never wholly understand. During that time he had been living with his youthful memory of her; but she had doubtless had other and more tangible companionship. Perhaps she too had kept her memory of him as something apart; but if she had, it must have been like a relic in a small dim chapel, where there was not time to pray every day. . . . They had crossed the Place des Invalides, and were walking down one of the thoroughfares flanking the building. It was a quiet quarter, after all, in spite of its splendour and its history; and the fact gave one an idea of the riches Paris had to draw on, since such scenes as this were left to the few and the indifferent. The day was fading into a soft sun-shot haze, pricked here and there by a yellow electric light, and passers were rare in the little square into which they had turned. Dallas stopped again, and looked up. ""It must be here,"" he said, slipping his arm through his father's with a movement from which Archer's shyness did not shrink; and they stood together looking up at the house. It was a modern building, without distinctive character, but many-windowed, and pleasantly balconied up its wide cream-coloured front. On one of the upper balconies, which hung well above the rounded tops of the horse-chestnuts in the square, the awnings were still lowered, as though the sun had just left it. ""I wonder which floor--?"" Dallas conjectured; and moving toward the porte-cochere he put his head into the porter's lodge, and came back to say: ""The fifth. It must be the one with the awnings."" Archer remained motionless, gazing at the upper windows as if the end of their pilgrimage had been attained. ""I say, you know, it's nearly six,"" his son at length reminded him. The father glanced away at an empty bench under the trees. ""I believe I'll sit there a moment,"" he said. ""Why--aren't you well?"" his son exclaimed. ""Oh, perfectly. But I should like you, please, to go up without me."" Dallas paused before him, visibly bewildered. ""But, I say, Dad: do you mean you won't come up at all?"" ""I don't know,"" said Archer slowly. ""If you don't she won't understand."" ""Go, my boy; perhaps I shall follow you."" Dallas gave him a long look through the twilight. ""But what on earth shall I say?"" ""My dear fellow, don't you always know what to say?"" his father rejoined with a smile. ""Very well. I shall say you're old-fashioned, and prefer walking up the five flights because you don't like lifts."" His father smiled again. ""Say I'm old-fashioned: that's enough."" Dallas looked at him again, and then, with an incredulous gesture, passed out of sight under the vaulted doorway. Archer sat down on the bench and continued to gaze at the awninged balcony. He calculated the time it would take his son to be carried up in the lift to the fifth floor, to ring the bell, and be admitted to the hall, and then ushered into the drawing-room. He pictured Dallas entering that room with his quick assured step and his delightful smile, and wondered if the people were right who said that his boy ""took after him."" Then he tried to see the persons already in the room--for probably at that sociable hour there would be more than one--and among them a dark lady, pale and dark, who would look up quickly, half rise, and hold out a long thin hand with three rings on it. . . . He thought she would be sitting in a sofa-corner near the fire, with azaleas banked behind her on a table. ""It's more real to me here than if I went up,"" he suddenly heard himself say; and the fear lest that last shadow of reality should lose its edge kept him rooted to his seat as the minutes succeeded each other. He sat for a long time on the bench in the thickening dusk, his eyes never turning from the balcony. At length a light shone through the windows, and a moment later a man-servant came out on the balcony, drew up the awnings, and closed the shutters. At that, as if it had been the signal he waited for, Newland Archer got up slowly and walked back alone to his hotel.  A Note on the Text    first appeared in four large installments in The Pictorial Review, from July to October 1920. It was published that same year in book Back to Full Books byEdith Wharton form by D. Appleton and Company in New York and in London. Wharton made extensive stylistic, punctuation, and spelling changes and revisions between the serial and book publication, and more than thirty subsequent changes were made after the second impression of the book edition had been run off. This authoritative text is reprinted from the Library of America edition of Novels by Edith Wharton, and is based on the sixth impression of the first edition, which incorporates the last set of extensive revisions that are obviously authorial.  "
Henry VIII: Novel Summary: Act 1 Scene 2,"    The king, leaning on Wolsey's shoulder, thanks him for foiling Buckingham's treasonous plot. He asks for Buckingham's Surveyor, who had testified against his master, to be brought before him so that he can hear his evidence. Queen Katherine enters, with the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, and kneels before the king. The king greets her and bids her rise, but she insists on remaining on her knees, since she is going to make a request of him. She explains that she has been asked to intercede with the king by his subjects, who are upset at the levying of new taxes. The people especially blame Wolsey, who originated the taxes, but their anger is also directed at the king, who is ultimately responsible. She fears that rebellion will break out. Norfolk backs up her argument, saying that employers have had to lay off their employees in order to pay the taxes, creating a desperate class of unemployed and starving people. The king says he is unaware of the new tax. Katherine explains that each subject is being asked to pay one sixth of his worth to pay for the king's wars in France, and that this is turning formerly loyal subjects hostile. The king says he is unhappy about the tax. Wolsey protests that the tax was levied unanimously by the entire king's Council and approved by the judges; his was only ""a single voice"" in the decision. He says that we should not refrain from doing necessary actions out of fear of malicious critics. He adds that our best actions are often the most criticised, and our worst, the most praised. The king replies that things that are carefully thought out do not create fear in the people. Believing that the tax is far too harsh, he tells Wolsey to revoke it and send letters to each county issuing a free pardon for any man who has refused to pay. Wolsey passes this order on to his secretary, but tells him to start a rumor that it is at Wolsey's request that the king revoked the tax. Buckingham's former Surveyor comes in. Katherine tells the king that she regrets that he is displeased with Buckingham. The king praises Buckingham's noble qualities, but says that he has become corrupted. He asks the Surveyor to repeat his evidence so that Katherine can hear it. The Surveyor says that Buckingham told his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny, that if the king died without a male heir, he himself would claim the throne. A friar, Nicholas Henton, had encouraged Buckingham to believe that he could be king. Katherine points out that Buckingham had fired the Surveyor when his tenants complained about him. She warns that the Surveyor could be giving false evidence to gain revenge on his former master. But the king asks the Surveyor to continue. The Surveyor vows that he is telling the truth. He goes on to say that Buckingham had said that if the king died, he (Buckingham) would have Wolsey and Sir Thomas Lovell executed in order to clear his path to the throne. The Surveyor also claims that Buckingham had told a story about his father, who had planned to kill Richard III to prevent him from usurping the throne, but had been foiled when he could not gain admittance to Richard. Buckingham, the Surveyor says, had vowed to outdo his father and kill King . The king is convinced that Buckingham is a traitor and orders that he be brought to trial immediately. Analysis By far the wisest character in this scene (arguably, in the whole play) is Queen Katherine. She has the ability to look beyond the surface of things and see their root causes. She warns the king of imminent rebellion if he does not repeal Wolsey's new tax. She also warns the king of the unreliability of the Surveyor's evidence against Buckingham, on the grounds that he might be motivated by a grudge against his former master, who had fired him. The king, while motivated by integrity and generosity, lacks his wife's insight. Though he takes Katherine's advice regarding the tax and repeals it, by his inattention, he allows Wolsey, who originated the tax, to continue to operate in pursuit of his own ends. This confirms Buckingham's charge in the previous scene that Wolsey has taken on some of the king's authority. The king also shows poor judgement in failing to listen to Katherine when she warns that the Surveyor may not be an impartial witness. Naively, he is more ready to trust Wolsey in his view of Buckingham as a traitor. The Surveyor's reference to Richard III refers to Shakespeare's play of that name. The play tells how Buckingham's father, also called the Duke of Buckingham, supported Richard in his struggle to be crowned king. He helped Richard get rid of those family members who stood between him and the throne. Eventually, Buckingham Senior had begun to doubt Richard and refused to carry out his order to murder two young princes who preceded Richard in line to the throne. When Richard became king, Buckingham Senior asked for the reward of land that Richard had promised him. Richard, however, suspected that he could no longer rely on Buckingham Senior's loyalty, and had him executed. In , the Surveyor says that Buckingham Junior was planning to go further than his father, and to kill King Henry. ",Henry VIII,Act 1 Scene 2," [Cornets. Enter the King, leaning on the Cardinal's shoulder, the Nobles, and Sir Thomas Lovell; the Cardinal places himself under the King's feet on his right side.] KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it, Thanks you for this great care. I stood i' the level Of a full-charg'd confederacy, and give thanks To you that chok'd it. Let be call'd before us That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person I'll hear his confessions justify; And point by point the treasons of his master He shall again relate. [A noise within, crying ""Room for the Queen!"" Enter Queen Katherine, ushered by the Duke of Norfolk, and the Duke of Suffolk; she kneels. The King riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him.] QUEEN KATHERINE. Nay, we must longer kneel; I am a suitor. KING. Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit Never name to us, you have half our power; The other moiety, ere you ask, is given. Repeat your will and take it. QUEEN KATHERINE. Thank your Majesty. That you would love yourself, and in that love Not unconsidered leave your honour, nor The dignity of your office, is the point Of my petition. KING. Lady mine, proceed. QUEEN KATHERINE. I am solicited, not by a few, And those of true condition, that your subjects Are in great grievance. There have been commissions Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties; wherein, although, My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you, as putter on Of these exactions, yet the King our master-- Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!--even he escapes not Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks The sides of loyalty, and almost appears In loud rebellion. NORFOLK. Not ""almost appears,"" It doth appear; for, upon these taxations, The clothiers all, not able to maintain The many to them longing, have put off The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who, Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger And lack of other means, in desperate manner Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar, And danger serves among them. KING. Taxation! Wherein? and what taxation? My Lord Cardinal, You that are blam'd for it alike with us, Know you of this taxation? WOLSEY. Please you, sir, I know but of a single part, in aught Pertains to the state, and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me. QUEEN KATHERINE. No, my lord? You know no more than others? But you frame Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome To those which would not know them, and yet must Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions, Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are Most pestilent to the hearing; and, to bear 'em, The back is sacrifice to the load. They say They are devis'd by you; or else you suffer Too hard an exclamation. KING. Still exaction! The nature of it? In what kind, let's know, Is this exaction? QUEEN KATHERINE. I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience; but am bold'ned Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief Comes through commissions, which compels from each The sixth part of his substance, to be levied Without delay; and the pretence for this Is nam'd, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths; Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze Allegiance in them; their curses now Live where their prayers did; and it's come to pass This tractable obedience is a slave To each incensed will. I would your Highness Would give it quick consideration, for There is no primer business. KING. By my life, This is against our pleasure. WOLSEY. And for me, I have no further gone in this than by A single voice; and that not pass'd me but By learned approbation of the judges. If I am Traduc'd by ignorant tongues, which neither know My faculties nor person, yet will be The chronicles of my doing, let me say 'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake That virtue must go through. We must not stint Our necessary actions, in the fear To cope malicious censurers; which ever, As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further Than vainly longing. What we oft do best, By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft, Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up For our best act. If we shall stand still, In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at, We should take root here where we sit, or sit State-statues only. KING. Things done well, And with a care, exempt themselves from fear; Things done without example, in their issue Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent Of this commission? I believe, not any. We must not rend our subjects from our laws, And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each? A trembling contribution! Why, we take From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber; And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd, The air will drink the sap. To every county Where this is question'd send our letters, with Free pardon to each man that has deni'd The force of this commission. Pray, look to't; I put it to your care. WOLSEY. A word with you. [To the Secretary, aside.] Let there be letters writ to every shire, Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons Hardly conceive of me; let it be nois'd That through our intercession this revokement And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you Further in the proceeding. [Exit Secretary.] [Enter Surveyor.] QUEEN KATHERINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasure. KING. It grieves many. The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker; To nature none more bound; his training such That he may furnish and instruct great teachers, And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see, When these so noble benefits shall prove Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt, They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly Than ever they were fair. This man so complete, Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we, Almost with ravish'd list'ning, could not find His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady, Hath into monstrous habits put the graces That once were his, and is become as black As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear-- This was his gentleman in trust--of him Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount The fore-recited practices, whereof We cannot feel too little, hear too much. WOLSEY. Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you, Most like a careful subject, have collected Out of the Duke of Buckingham. KING. Speak freely. SURVEYOR. First, it was usual with him, every day It would infect his speech, that if the King Should without issue die, he'll carry it so To make the sceptre his. These very words I've heard him utter to his son-in-law, Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menac'd Revenge upon the Cardinal. WOLSEY. Please your Highness, note This dangerous conception in this point. Not friended by his wish, to your high person His will is most malignant; and it stretches Beyond you, to your friends. QUEEN KATHERINE. My learn'd Lord Cardinal, Deliver all with charity. KING. Speak on. How grounded he his title to the crown? Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him At any time speak aught? SURVEYOR. He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton. KING. What was that Henton? SURVEYOR. Sir, a Chartreux friar, His confessor; who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty. KING. How know'st thou this? SURVEYOR. Not long before your Highness sped to France, The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey. I repli'd, Men fear the French would prove perfidious, To the King's danger. Presently the Duke Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted 'Twould prove the verity of certain words Spoke by a holy monk, ""that oft,"" says he, ""Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour To hear from him a matter of some moment; Whom after under the confession's seal He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke My chaplain to no creature living but To me should utter, with demure confidence This pausingly ensu'd: 'Neither the King nor's heirs, Tell you the Duke, shall prosper. Bid him strive To gain the love o' the commonalty. The Duke Shall govern England.""' QUEEN KATHERINE. If I know you well, You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office On the complaint o' the tenants. Take good heed You charge not in your spleen a noble person And spoil your nobler soul; I say, take heed; Yes, heartily beseech you. KING. Let him on. Go forward. SURVEYOR. On my soul, I'll speak but truth. I told my lord the Duke, by the devil's illusions The monk might be deceiv'd; and that 'twas dangerous for him To ruminate on this so far, until It forg'd him some design; which, being believ'd, It was much like to do. He answer'd, ""Tush, It can do me no damage;"" adding further That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd, The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads Should have gone off. KING. Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha! There's mischief in this man. Canst thou say further? SURVEYOR. I can, my liege. KING. Proceed. SURVEYOR. Being at Greenwich, After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke About Sir William Bulmer,-- KING. I remember Of such a time; being my sworn servant, The Duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence? SURVEYOR. ""If,"" quoth he, ""I for this had been committed,"" --As, to the Tower, I thought,--""I would have play'd The part my father meant to act upon The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, Made suit to come in 's presence; which if granted, As he made semblance of his duty, would Have put his knife into him."" KING. A giant traitor! WOLSEY. Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom, And this man out of prison? QUEEN KATHERINE. God mend all! KING. There's something more would out of thee; what say'st? SURVEYOR. After ""the Duke his father,"" with ""the knife,"" He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger, Another spread on 's breast, mounting his eyes, He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenour Was, were he evil us'd, he would outgo His father by as much as a performance Does an irresolute purpose. KING. There's his period, To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd. Call him to present trial. If he may Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none, Let him not seek 't of us. By day and night, He's traitor to th' height. [Exeunt.]  "
Pride and Prejudice: Novel Summary: Chapters 21-24," Mr. Collins begins to ignore Elizabeth, and his attentions are transferred to Miss Lucas.  After breakfast, the girls walk to Meryton and meet Wickham, who tells Elizabeth that he was not at the ball because he did not want to be in the same room as Darcy for so long.  When they return home, a letter is delivered to Jane, which quite distresses her.  She tells Elizabeth that it is from Caroline Bingley, and that the entire party has left Netherfield for London, and that they do not intend to return again.  Later in the letter Caroline says that all are anxious to see Miss Darcy again, as Louisa (Mrs. Hurst) and she are hoping for a marriage between her and Bingley. Jane is quite upset about this, as she had held hopes of marrying Bingley, and now she finds out that Bingley's sisters want him to marry another.  Elizabeth tries to convince Jane that Bingley is indeed in love with her, and that this other marriage is just something that the sisters are trying to devise. Jane does not believe that the sisters could be so deceiving and that they must only want the happiness of their brother.  The next day the Bennets dine with the Lucases, and Elizabeth is grateful to Charlotte for attending to Collins.  It soon becomes evident though, that Charlotte is doing it in order to engage Collins' admiration for herself.  The two are engaged to be married in a short time, and when Charlotte tells Elizabeth, she cannot believe it.  She feels that it is a mistake for Charlotte to marry Collins, and that she will not be happy.  Mr. Collins returns to his parish, saying that he will return soon.  Sir William calls on the Bennets to announce the engagement of his daughter to Collins, and now it is Mrs. Bennet's turn to think it impossible, but the family is soon convinced.  The relationship between Elizabeth and Charlotte changes, as Elizabeth feels that here can be no real confidence between them any longer.  Mrs. Bennet is concerned by the removal of the Bingleys from Netherfield, and continues to wonder when they will return, which upsets Jane.  Elizabeth fears that Bingley's sisters will be successful in keeping him away from Jane.  Mr. Collins returns to Longbourn for a visit so that he can spend time with Charlotte.  Jane receives another letter from Miss Bingley, stating that they will indeed stay in London all winter.  Mrs. Bennet continues to speak of Bingley, and Jane confides to Elizabeth how much pain it brings her.  Elizabeth continues to speak against the marriage of Charlotte and Collins to Jane, and continues to insist that it must be the influence of Bingley's sisters and Darcy that keeps Bingley away from Jane.  The Bennet family has many meetings with Wickham, and the story of Darcy's abuse of him is now publicly known.  ",Pride and Prejudice,Chapters 21-24,"  The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, HIS feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend. The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay. After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence HAD been self-imposed. ""I found,"" said he, ""as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."" She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and he companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: ""This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."" She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: ""I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that."" To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his. ""It is unlucky,"" said she, after a short pause, ""that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."" ""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"" ""When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."" ""It is evident by this,"" added Jane, ""that he comes back no more this winter."" ""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he SHOULD."" ""Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know ALL. I WILL read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from YOU."" ""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, WE are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"" ""What do you think of THIS sentence, my dear Lizzy?"" said Jane as she finished it. ""Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"" ""Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"" ""Most willingly."" ""You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."" Jane shook her head. ""Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been ONE intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of YOUR merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."" ""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"" replied Jane, ""your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself."" ""That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."" ""But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"" ""You must decide for yourself,"" said Elizabeth; ""and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."" ""How can you talk so?"" said Jane, faintly smiling. ""You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."" ""I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."" ""But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"" The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone. She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart. They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.  The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. ""It keeps him in good humour,"" said she, ""and I am more obliged to you than I can express."" Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of COMING OUT a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them. ""My dear madam,"" he replied, ""this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."" They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said: ""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness."" ""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins,"" I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."" ""You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that WE shall take no offence."" ""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."" With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before. The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying herself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: ""Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!"" The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: ""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"" But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. ""I see what you are feeling,"" replied Charlotte. ""You must be surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."" Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;"" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.  Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed: ""Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"" Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London. Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return. Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence. Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. As for Jane, HER anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. ""Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"" said she, ""it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for HER, and live to see her take her place in it!"" ""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."" This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. ""I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."" ""What should not you mind?"" ""I should not mind anything at all."" ""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."" ""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should HE have it more than anybody else?"" ""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet.  "
The Inferno: Novel Summary: Canto 12," A sheer mountainside leads down to the Seventh Circle; they can only get down it where a landslide has shattered the rocks, but just there stands the Minotaur, half man, half bull. Virgil enrages him by taunting him with his defeat at the hands of Theseus, and they slip by while he writhes in rage. At the foot of the cliff is a river of boiling blood, in which all those who shed the blood of others suffer. Centaurs, half man, half horse, guard the banks, and they courteously help Virgil and Dante. The centaur who goes with them carries Dante on his back, so that he can get across the river, and points out the famous sinners who boil there. Deepest in the river are the tyrants and conquerors, such as Alexander and Attila, and recent tyrants of cities in Italy who had been notorious for their violence. Analysis Dante does not speak of Alexander as Alexander the Great; the ""glory"" Alexander and his fellow tyrants won is lost in a river of blood, and they are distinguished from murderers and burglars by being plunged deeper in the river. As for the courteous centaurs, it has been suggested that many who at that time made Italy miserable by their violence seemed courteous and noble in person, but in Dante's eyes their violence made them less than human. ",Dantes Inferno,Canto 12," 1. With this Canto begins the Seventh Circle of the Inferno, in which the Violent are punished. In the first Girone or round are the Violent against their neighbors, plunged more or less deeply in the river of boiling blood. 2. Mr. Ruskin, Modern Painters, III. 242, has the following remarks upon Dante's idea of rocks and mountains.-- ""At the top of the abyss of the seventh circle, appointed for the `violent,' or souls who had done evil by force, we are told, first, that the edge of it was composed of `great broken stones in a circle'; then, that the place was `Alpine'; and, becoming hereupon attentive, in order to hear what an Alpine place is like, we find that it was `like the place beyond Trent, where the rock, either by earthquake, or failure of support, has broken down to the plain, so that it gives any one at the top some means of getting down to the bottom.' This is not a very elevated or enthusiastic description of an Alpine scene; and it is far from mended by the following verses, in which we are told that Dante `began to go down by this great unloading of stones,' and that they moved often under his feet by reason of the new weight. The fact is that Dante, by many expressions throughout the poem, shows himself to have been a notably bad climber; and being fond of sitting in the sun, looking at his fair Baptistery, or walking in a dignified manner on flat pavement in a long robe, it puts him seriously out of his way when he has to take to his hands and knees, or look to his feet; so that the first strong impression made upon him by any Alpine scene whatever is, clearly, that it is bad walking. When he is in a fright and hurry, and has a very steep place to go down, Virgil has to carry him altogether."" 5. Speaking of the region to which Dante here alludes, Eustace, Classical Tour, I. 71, says:--""The descent becomes more rapid between Roveredo and Ala; the river, which glided gently through the valley of Trent, assumes the roughness of a torrent; the defiles become narrower; and the mountains break into rocks and precipices, which occasionally approach the road, sometimes rise perpendicular from it, and now and then hand over it in terrible majesty."" In a note he adds:-- ""Amid these wilds the traveller cannot fail to notice a vast tract called the Slavini di Marco, covered with fragments of rock torn from the sides of the neighboring mountains by an earthquake, or perhaps by their own unsupported weight, and hurled down into the plains below. They spread over the whole valley, and in some places contract the road to a very narrow space. A few firs and cypresses scattered in the intervals, or sometimes rising out of the crevices of the rocks, cast a partial and melancholy shade amid the surrounding nakedness and desolation. This scene of ruin seems to have made a deep impression upon the wild imagination of Dante, as he has introduced it into the twelfth canto of the Inferno, in order to give the reader an adequate idea of one of his infernal ramparts."" 12. The Minotaur, half bull, half man. See the infamous story in all the classical dictionaries. 18. The Duke of Athens is Theseus. Chaucer gives him the same title in The Knights Tale:--  ""Whilom, as olde stories tellen us, Ther was a duk that highte Theseus. Of Athenes he was lord and governour, That greter was ther non under the sonne. Ful many a rich contree had he wonne. What with his wisdom and his chevalrie, He conquerd all the regne of Feminie, That whilom was ycleped Scythia; And wedded the freshe quene Ipolita, And brought hire home with him to his contree With mochel glorie and great solempnitee, And eke hire yonge suster Emelie. And thus with victorie and with melodie Let I this worthy duk to Athenes ride, And all his host, in armes him beside."" Shakespeare also, in the Midsummer Night's Dream, calls him the Duke of Athens. 20. Ariadne, who gave Theseus the silken thread to guide him back through the Cretan labyrinth after slaying the Minotaur. Hawthorne has beatifully told the old story in his Tanglewood Tales.""Ah, the bull-headed villain!"" he says. ""And O my good little people, you will perhaps see, one of these days, as I do now, that every human being who suffers anything evil to get into his nature, or to remain there, is a kind of Minotaur, an enemy of his fellow- creatures, and separated from all good companionship, as this poor monster was."" 39. Christ's descent into Limbo, and the earthquake at the Crucifixion. 42. This is the doctrine of Empedocles and other old philosophers. See Ritter, History of Ancient Philosophy, Book V., Chap. vi. The following passages are from Mr. Morrison's translation: -- ""Empedocles proceeded from the Eleatic principle of the oneness of all truth. In its unity it resembles a ball; he calls it the sphere, wherein the ancients recognized the God of Empedoocles..... ""Into the unity of the sphere all elementary things are combined by love, without difference or distinction: within it they lead a happy life, replete with holiness, and remote from discord: They know no god of war nor the spirit of battles, Nor Zeus, the sovereign, nor Cronos, nor yet Poseidon, But Cypris the queen..... ""The actual separation of the elements one from another is produced by discord; for originally they were bound together in the sphere, and therein continued perfectly unmovable. Now in this Empedocles posits different periods and different conditions of the world; for, according to the above position, originally all is united in love, and then subsequently the elements and living essences are separated. .... ""His assertion of certain mundane periods was taken by the ancients literally; for they tell us that, according to his theory, All was originally one by love, but afterwards many and at enmity with itself through discord."" 56. The Centaurs are set to guard this Circle, as symbolizing violence, with some form of which the classic poets usually associate them. 68. Chaucer, The Monkes Tale:--  ""A lemman had this noble champion, That highte Deianire, as fresh as May; And as thise clerkes maken mention, She hath him sent a sherte fresh and gay: Alas! this sherte, alas and wala wa! Envenimed was sotilly withalle, That or that he had wered it half a day, It made his flesh all from his bones falle."" Chiron was a son of Saturn; Pholus, of Silenus; and Nessus, of Ixion and the Cloud. 71. Homer, Iliad, XI. 832, ""Whom Chiron instructed, the most just of the Centaurs."" Hawthorne gives a humorous turn to the fable of Chiron, in the Tanglewod Tales, p. 273:-- ""I have sometimes suspected that Master Chiron was not really very different from other people, but that, being a kind-hearted and merry old fellow, he was in the habit of making believe that he was a horse, and scrambling about the school-room on all fours, and letting the little boys ride upon his back. And so, when his scholars had grown up, and grown old, and were trotting their grandchildren on their knees, they told them about the sports of their school days; and these young folks took the idea that their grandfathers had been taught their letters by a Centaur, half man and half horse..... ""Be that as it may, it has always been told for a fact, (and always will be told, as long as the world lasts,) that Chiron, with the head of a schoolmaster, had the body and legs of a horse. Just imagine the grave old gentleman clattering and stamping into the school room on his four hoofs, perhaps treading on some little fellow's toes, flourishing his switch tail instead of a rod, and, now and them, trotting out of doors to eat a mouthful of grass!"" 77. Mr. Ruskin refers to this line in confirmation of his theory that ""all great art represents something that it sees or believes in; nothing unseen or uncredited."" The passage is as follows, Modern Painters, III. 83:-- ""And just because it is always something that it sees or believes in, there is the peculiar character above noted, almost unmistakable, in all high and true ideals, of having been as it were studies from the life, and involving pieces of sudden familiarity, and close specific painting which never would have been admitted or even thought of, had not the painter drawn either from the bodily life or from the life of faith. For instance, Dante's Centaur, Chiron, dividing his beard with his arrow before he can speak, is a thing that no mortal would ever have thought of, if he had not actually seen the Centaur do it. They might have composed handsome bodies of men and horses in all possible ways, through a whole life of pseudo-idealism, and yet never dreamed of any such thing. But the real living Centaur actually trotted across Dante's brain, and he saw him do it."" 107. Alexander of Thessaly and Dionysius of Syracuse. 51 110. Azzolino, or Ezzolino di Romano, tyrant of Padua, nicknamed the Son of the Devil. Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, III. 33, describes him as  ""Fierce Ezelin, that most inhuman lord, Who shall be deemed by men a child of hell."" His story may be found in Sismondi's Histoire des Republiques Italiennes, Chap. XIX. He so outraged the religious sense of the people by his cruelties, that a crusade was preached against him, and he died a prisoner in 1259, tearing the bandages from his wounds, and fierce and defiant to the last. ""Ezzolino was small of stature,"" says Sismondi, ""but the whole aspect of his person, all his movements, indicated the soldier. His language was bitter, his countenance proud; and by a single look, he made the boldest tremble. His soul, so greedy of all crimes, felt no attraction for sensual pleasures. Never had Ezzolino loved women; and this perhaps is the reason why in his punishments he was as pitiless against them as against men. He was in his sixty- sixth year when he died; and his reign of blood had lasted thirty- four years."" Many glimpses of him are given in the Cento Novelle Antiche, as if his memory long haunted the minds of men. Here are two of them, from Novella 83. ""Once upon a time Messer Azzolino da Romano made proclamation, through his own territories and elsewhere, that he wished to do a great charity, and therefore that all the beggars, both men and women, should assemble in his meadow, on a certain day, and to each he would give a new gown, and abundance of food. The news spread among the servants on all hands. When the day of assembling came, his seneschals went among them with the gowns and the food, and made them strip naked one by one, and then clothed them with new clothes, and fed them. They asked for their old rags, but it was all in vain; for he put them into a heap and set fire to them. Afterwards he found there so much gold and silver melted, that it more than paid the expense, and then he dismissed them with his blessing..... ""To tell you how much he was feared, would be a long story, and many people knew it. But I will recall how he, being one day with the Emperor on horseback, with all their people, they laid a wager as to which of them had the most beautiful sword. The Emperor drew from its sheath his own, which was wonderfully garnished with gold and precious stones. Then said Messer Azzolino: `It is very beautiful; but mine, without any great ornament, is far more beautiful'; -- and he drew it forth. Then six hundred knights, who were with him, all drew theirs. When the Emperor beheld this cloud of swords, he said: `Yours is the most beautiful.'"" 111. Obizzo da Esti, Marquis of Ferrara. He was murdered by Azzo, ""whom he thought to be his son,"" says Boccaccio, ""though he was not. "" The Ottimo Comento remarks: ""Many call themselves sons, and are step-sons."" 119. Guido di Monforte, who murdered Prince Henry of England ""in the bosom of God,"" that is, in the church, at Viterbo. The event is thus narrated by Napier, Florentine History, I. 283:-- ""Another instance of this revengeful spirit occurred in the year 1271 at Viterbo, where the cardinals had assembled to elect a successor to Clement the Fourth, about whom they had been long disputing: Charles of Anjou and Philip of France, with Edward and Henry, sons of Richard, Duke of Cornwall, had repaired there, the two first to hasten the election, which they finally accomplished by the elevation of Gregory the Tenth. During these proceedings Prince Henry, while taking the sacrament in the church of San Silvestro at Viterbo, was stabbed to the heart by his own cousin, Guy de Montfort, in revenge for the Earl of Leicester's death, although Henry was then endeavoring to procure his pardon. This sacrilegious act threw Viterbo into confusion, but Montfort had many supporters, one of whom asked him what he had done. `I have taken my revenge,' said he. ` But your father's body was trailed!' At this reproach, De Montfort instantly re-entered the church, walked straight to the altar, and, seizing Henry's body by the hair, dragged it through the aisle, and left it, still bleeding, in the open street: he then retired unmolested to the castle of his father-in-law, Count Rosso of the Maremma, and there remained in security!"" ""The body of the Prince,"" says Barlow, Study of Dante, p. 125, ""was brought to England, and interred at Hayles, in Gloucestershire, in the Abbey which his father had there built for monks of the Cistercian order; but his heart was put into a golden vase, and placed on the tomb of Edward the Confessor, in Westminster Abbey; most probably, as stated by some writers, in the hands of a statue. "" 123. Violence in all its forms was common enough in Florence in the age of Dante. 134. Attila, the Scourge of God. Gibbon, Decline and Fall, Chap. 39, describes him thus:-- ""Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal, descent from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation of a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuk; a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated eyes, a flat nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders, and a short, square body, of nervous strength, though of a disproportioned form. The haughty step and demeanor of the King of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired. "" 135. Which Pyrrhus and which Sextus, the commentators cannot determine; but incline to Pyrrhus of Epirus, and Sextus Pompey, the corsair of the Mediterranean. 137. Nothing more is known of these highwaymen than that the first infested the Roman sea-shore, and that the second was of a noble family of Florence. "
